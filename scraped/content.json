        "content": "I\u2019ll be honest.\nI\u2019m worried.\nI\u2019ve gone deep into the AGI and post-labor-work rabbit hole.\nThere\u2019s been a few questions on my mind for the past month:\nWhat can humans do that machines can\u2019t?\nWhat will the future of work look like?\nWhat jobs \u2013 if any \u2013 will persist over the next 20 years?\nWhat can we, as humans, do to secure an above-average future?\nWith these problems at the forefront of my mind, I\u2019ve found a few answers that may bring you optimism and clarity as you enter the unknown.\nI want to focus on this point that many are worried about:\nWe don\u2019t know what to teach children because we don\u2019t know what will be relevant in 20 years.\nI was worried about this too until I came across a post by Devon Erikson on X that shines light on the issue.\nI\u2019ve been binging any podcast I can find of him and reading his new sci-fi fiction book, Theft Of Fire. He is easily becoming one of my favorite thinkers.\nI hope one day, once I\u2019ve burned through his work, I can hold a high-level conversation with him on a podcast to share the similarities and differences between our worldviews. For now, I am the student.\nOn to his points:\nOnly slaves are expected to perform one task for their entire life.\nOur current education system reflects the education of slaves.\nThey were career-specific skills like growing wheat, herding sheep, and riding a horse.\nToday, we are taught to be useful workers. We are taught to obey the authority. We are conditioned to get good grades out of fear of punishment.\nA free man is expected to act on his interests and do many things throughout his life.\nIf you don\u2019t create a purpose, you will be assigned one.\nA purpose is a goal. Most people don\u2019t choose their own goals.\nA goal implies knowledge and skills that must be learned to solve problems that prevent you from achieving the goal.\nIf you don\u2019t choose your own goal, you do not choose what you learn or what problems you solve. Your destiny is decided for you because the only potential you know is the one you were assigned.\nThe difference between the two is how to live, how to think, and how to learn.\nTrue education, not a clone-producing machine we call public school, is an orientation toward how to live and thrive without being dependent on another.\nTrue education does not only teach career skills that produce results by performing specific tasks, but how to think and learn so they could adapt to any situation.\nStop worrying about what career skills AI will make obsolete.\nWorry about whether you are training (or being trained) to make ideal-future-aligned decisions, be open-minded and perceptive, and be self-motivated.\nEveryone is creative.\nCreativity is about achieving any goal with the knowledge and skill available to you, not fancy art or designs.\nIn other words, you need to learn how to set self-generated goals, utilize the internet, mentors, and the abundance of information you have access to to educate yourself.\nThen, you need to embrace trial and error, self-reflect, and experiment to create your own path.\nCreativity gives you the power to do whatever you want in life.\nThose who don\u2019t realize this gift are doomed to the assignments of others.\nThe Irreplaceable Individual\nIt is impossible to know what the future will hold.\nAll we know is that there will be a way of life that leads to the most satisfaction.\nWhile some aspects of this ideal lifestyle will be unique, like the interests you choose to pursue, the overarching principles of the good life remain immutable, like what allows you to pursue those interests as a sovereign individual.\nTo discover what these are, we must look at what is not taught in schools.\nIf schools train you to be a modern slave that performs one task in one career for the entirety of your life, what is the knowledge and skill that sovereign individuals are taught \u2013 or teach themselves?\n1) The Future-Proof Skill Stack\nIn Eriksen\u2019s opinion, the seven liberal arts (or \u201cliberating arts,\u201d not to be confused with the ideological monstrosity found in a specific department of formal education taught by those who are not liberated themselves) are, quote:\nLogic: how to derive truth from known facts\nStatistics: how to understand the implications of data\nRhetoric: how to persuade, and spot persuasion tactics\nResearch: how to gather information on an unknown subject\n(Practical) Psychology: how to discern and understand the true motives of others\nInvestment: how to manage and grow existing assets\nAgency: how to make decisions about what course to pursue, and proactively take action to pursue it.\nI would encourage you to hold these in your mind while pushing into the unknown.\nIf you prepare yourself with a future-proof mind, what technical skills will be lucrative or useful in the far future are irrelevant because you can adapt as necessary.\nTo learn the liberating arts, these are the skills I learned:\nMarketing & sales \u2013 if you don\u2019t know how to attract and persuade, you will never get what you want, and your only option will be for an employer (or the government) to give it to you. (Rhetoric, psychology)\nWriting & thinking \u2013 the ability to communicate the value in your unique mind. The foundation of getting in front of other people. (Logic, research)\nEntrepreneurship \u2013 the process of taking my future into my own hands, hunting for my survival, and building products that I want to see in the world (that others care about). (Statistics, agency, investment)\nSome may say things like entrepreneurship aren\u2019t a \u201cskill,\u201d but I would argue that any mental process that becomes more efficient with time is a skill.\nEverything is a skill, but most people don\u2019t treat their life as a practice.\nNobody can tell you how they write, think, market, and sell. They can only tell you how they do it.\nMeaning that to learn these skills, you must embrace a self-experimentation mindset.\nYour job is to:\nResearch processes that others have found success with. Thankfully, you can find these with a simple search.\nExperiment with various techniques. Implement the processes you learn and attempt to get results.\nIdentify patterns and principles. Note the similarities between each and double down on them.\nCreate your own process. Tailor what you learn to your unique lifestyle and situation.\nContribute to true education by passing it down. Give people education that can\u2019t be taught in schools with a fundamental grounding in critical thinking.\nWith entrepreneurship as your vessel, you set the scene for true education and sovereignty.\nWith writing and thinking, you continuously create, test, and iterate on the value you have to offer.\nYou are required to learn practical psychology \u2013 marketing and sales \u2013 to understand the minds of yourself and your customers.\nYou then persuade, not force or deceive, to inspire people to care about the value you have to offer.\nThe future-proof skills are the foundation of Kortex University. My school for becoming a synthesizer in 90-120 days.\n2) Technical Know-How\nWith the foundation of a future-proof skill stack, the next step is adapting to the times with technical skills.\nIn the digital renaissance, this means:\nSocial media \u2013 building a name for yourself as your storefront for the value you create. The command center for your business.\nContent \u2013 writing or video to educate, entertain, and inspire people to see your value.\nEmail marketing \u2013 newsletters or sequences to nurture the audience you acquire.\nVisual design \u2013 illustrating the vibe of your brand to spark emotion in your viewers.\nFunnel building \u2013 creating landing pages, websites, and fueling them with other technical skills like content and email.\nThe requirements to learn these skills are bound to change as artificial intelligence shakes the industry. They won\u2019t go away any time soon, but the general competition will increase due to the ease in acquiring these skills. Few people will learn the future-proof skills above, those are what will secure your future.\nThese technical skills are the current vessel for your entrepreneurial ventures.\n3) Personal Interests\nNow the questions you\u2019re asking are:\nWhat do I write about?\nWhat do I market and sell?\nWhat do I email, design, or leverage technical skills with?\nThe interests you can\u2019t help but tell others about.\nThe books you can\u2019t pull yourself away from.\nThe ideas that flood your search history.\nThe projects you dream of building but can\u2019t seem to find the time to.\nYou don\u2019t \u201cfind\u201d a profitable niche. You create a profitable niche through persuasion.\nNobody can tell you what niche to go into, they can only tell you the one they went into.\nIf you understood the future-proof skills, and therefore human nature, you would understand that you can control the perception of your interests.\nInterest is generated. Interest is programmed. You are interested in specific things because of how you were raised and the information you were exposed to.\nYou are interested in them for a reason. That means others can become interested in them with well-placed writing on social media. This has happened to you before. Go scroll the timeline and tell me something doesn\u2019t persuade you to change your behavior.\nYou spend time, attention, and money on your interests. That means others will spend those same resources on you if you are valuable enough.\nFree people don\u2019t choose a niche, they create one.\nThe Digital Renaissance\nMost people don\u2019t try to become the top 5% in any skill because they don\u2019t realize that the 95% is comprised of people who put 0% effort outside of anything they were told to do by their parents or society.\n30-60 minutes a day for 6-12 months puts you ahead of almost everyone.\nEven that is too much to ask of most people.\nThanks to the decentralized education system being built in front of our eyes (creators on social media teaching paths they\u2019ve gotten results in) you can quickly learn relevant skills that allow you to adapt to the changing career landscape.\nIn my eyes, it is silly to bank your future on education from those who are employed to be teachers.\nI am not talking about general education. That is useful for getting people on the same page. I am talking about further education, when you are at the pivotal moment where you must choose what interest you want to pursue.\nIf the goal is to be in control of your future, it is wise to avoid education by those teaching how to be free but aren\u2019t free themselves.\nSTEM education makes sense because it teaches hard skills, but an education in the liberal arts required to be free is learned better by those who have done what you are interested in doing.\nPosts, podcasts, videos, courses, and coaching.\nUse them to study every skill or interest we\u2019ve discussed in this letter.\nNobody is going to give you the time. You must take it. Set aside 30-60 minutes in a non-distracting block of your day and build the habit. It will be difficult at the start as with anything new. Don\u2019t expect otherwise.\nThe Domain Of Mastery\nMastery is a blend of creative and specific work.\nMastery cannot be trained, it must be practiced.\nYou don\u2019t succeed by being smarter.\nYou don\u2019t succeed by working harder.\nYou succeed when you possess specific domain-relevant knowledge with a creative vessel for distribution.\nI can be smart, with an IQ of 175, but if a bug occurs in a complex code base, how will being smart help me fix that? I need to know a bunch of very specific things about the code base.\nNow, I can have specific knowledge of that domain, but if I am not one influencing the vision of that code base, I am not free, and I can be replaced.\nIt is difficult to replace someone who is highly equipped with specific knowledge, but it can still happen. And if that individual is replaced, do they have the creativity to make that knowledge work for them?\nYour domain of mastery contains the skills and interests listed above.\nEntrepreneurship is your vessel \u2013 so you are in full control of your future.\nMarketing and sales are your message \u2013 so you can inspire people to care about what you do.\nWriting and thinking are your medium \u2013 so you can distribute your message in public.\nTechnical know-how is the \u201chow\u201d \u2013 so you can succeed in the current market landscape.\nPersonal interests are the \u201cwhat\u201d \u2013 so you have a craft to pour your heart and soul into.\nYour ideal future is the \u201cwhy\u201d \u2013 so you solve a problem that you have experience with.\nAn ideal future is born from adversity.\nIf you listen to the stories of the most successful entrepreneurs (excluding cases of unconscious competence), you will discover a common theme.\nThey built a product for one of three reasons:\nTo make something that helped them better.\nTo solve a problem in their life.\nTo build what they wanted to see in the world.\nOr, even better, a combination of them all.\nOne suffered from eczema, experimented with all of the products they could on the market, and couldn\u2019t find one that suited them.\nThe best they could find was a boring, scentless bar of soap.\nSo, they obsessed over botanicals and horticulture. Studied it like their life depended on it \u2013 because it did \u2013 and created a soap line that smelled good, looked good, and didn\u2019t irritate their skin.\nI, as another example, had trouble with consistent writing quality to fuel my business. Nobody seemed to understand that there was more to writing than just writing.\nSince it was the foundation of my business success, and with having a plethora of specific knowledge in that domain, I experimented with other\u2019s processes until I was able to create one that suited my unique goals.\nThat is how 2 Hour Writer was born. My hyper-successful course.\nIt may not work for some, but for others, it is the course that changed everything and shaped a huge portion of the creator space as we know it \u2013 including many spinoff products with other processes you can try.\nNotice the Value Equation from last week coming into play. It starts with a problem, reveals a goal, and sets a potential process to be created.\nTo wrap this up, technology only continues to advance.\nBeing scared of it is a great way to ruin your future.\nThe wise decision is to use it. Dissect it. Understand it.\nAllow it to help you acquire skills faster and build your future in record time.\nI hope you enjoyed this letter.\nIt was one of my favorites to write so far.\nDan"

        "content": "You are chasing status.\nIt is an immutable principle in human nature that has persisted since the dawn of time.\nTo think that you aren\u2019t chasing status as a noble pursuit is still a status game. The desire to kill the ego is still a desire of the ego. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. It means it\u2019s natural, and once you accept that you begin to be rewarded for it.\nAnd whether you like it or not, people judge you based on your relative status. To not accept this is to accept the other option: a life of being treated unfairly while having little impact on the world.\nYou have a status in your social circle.\nYou have a status in your job or career.\nYou have a status in your religious organization.\nPeople assign you a status when they first see you. This is out of your control, but you can position yourself to increase the likelihood of being perceived high status.\nPeople determine whether they want to engage and offer you opportunities based on that status.\nPeople determine whether they want to hire you, pay you, or help you based on that status.\nEven if it was unintentional \u2013 which I doubt it was based on their high level of awareness \u2013 leaders that we glorify like Jesus Christ, Eckhart Tolle, Naval Ravikant, Alan Watts, Jordan Peterson, Ken Wilber, and most others who come to mind were and are playing a status game.\nHow else would they gain such mass attention, attract a hierarchy of followers, and change the direction of evolution for the better? I don\u2019t want to hear your edge cases of high-status people who miss the crucial piece of inner work and personal development to balance out the chaos of status.\nIn other words, if you want to contribute to humanity on a large enough scale, status is important.\nIf it does not involve status, it is doomed to die off.\nStatus is wired into our survival as a species, and once that becomes conscious, you can impact the world and minimize the negative effects of your pursuit.\nIf it remains unconscious, you will manipulate and cheat without knowing it.\nYou can show me images of the \u201cconsciousness scale\u201d all day long and persuade me about the dissolution of self, but that scale is still a hierarchy of varying status and a static representation of the complexity of blending states of consciousness, and you are still persuading me that something is better than something else.\nStatus is not a static and evil construct. There are higher and lower levels. But nobody starts at the top.\nThe Value Equation: How To Make Anything Valuable\nThe path of the problem solver, or value creator, is how you escape the world of replaceability. Fall in love with the challenge that problems present, from superficial to metaphysical, and your ideal future will create itself. \u2013 The Art of Focus\nLooks come before depth.\nA nice car can have a billion-dollar founder approach you and ask what you do, opening a world of opportunity.\nA nice body can get you in the door with a partner who values health, strength, and discipline.\nPeople love to close their mind to material or superficial pursuits but don\u2019t realize that those are the only starting points. You don\u2019t start digging from the core. You dig from the surface. Material is the barrier of the immaterial.\nBecoming valuable, or increasing the impact of both looks and depth, is how you play the game of life.\nDon\u2019t hate the game. Don\u2019t hate the player. Master them both.\nStatus, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is your experience level in the game of life.\nThe Macronutrients Of Value \u2013 Perspective\nWhen you understand how to create value, you can:\nChange your life\nHelp others change their lives\nWrite, speak, and think with clarity\nCreate content, landing pages, or marketing that sells\nNavigate relationships in a mutually beneficial manner\nUnderstand your emotions and move past them\nThe framework I\u2019m about to teach you is how you create solutions to problems.\nIt is the foundation of human behavior, business, and communication.\nValue is truth.\nValue is story.\nValue is progress.\nValue is transformation.\nValue is reversing entropy.\nValue is a signal of meaning in your psyche.\nOur mind has little ideas floating around inside of it that are waiting to be connected.\nWhen they connect, you feel the clarity. It all makes sense.\nWhenever you are failing to achieve a result like making more money, improving your health, or motivating yourself to act on a better future \u2013 it\u2019s because you are missing one of these pieces that make it all click:\nProblem \u2013 A limitation or challenge that creates pain when unsolved.\nGoal \u2013 An impactful end result that allows the recipient to evolve beyond the problem.\nProcess \u2013 A creative system that breeds knowledge, skill, and awareness to bridge the gap between problem and solution.\nIf you want to improve your life, you must identify a problem, direct your mind toward a goal, and experiment with solutions until you create a path to achieve the goal.\nIf you want to make money, you must help others identify a problem, direct their attention toward a goal, and give them the clarity to act on a better future.\nIf you want to better a relationship, you must both realize the problem, share a goal in your head, and both put effort into solving the problem.\nA problem, goal, and process provide the structure for anything you do from writing to marketing to behaving to building a product to telling a story.\nIf you\u2019ve read The Art Of Focus, you\u2019ve seen this before as the \u201cPurpose, Path, Priority\u201d chapter.\nNow, if you want to make this more impactful, utilize the micronutrients of value.\nThe Micronutrients Of Value \u2013 Perception\nValue boils down to perspective and perception.\nIf people are not aware of the problem, believe the goal is possible, or have the clarity to achieve it \u2013 they will not be able to perceive the importance of the value you have to offer.\nUse these as a way to shape the perception of your readers:\nConcept \u2013 a way of packaging up and naming your value in a way that captures attention and sticks in people\u2019s heads.\nProof \u2013 giving people the belief it\u2019s possible through personal or peer results.\nRisk reversal \u2013 reducing the perceived uncertainty, friction, and difficulty of getting results.\nPain points \u2013 amplifying the problem to illustrate how the problem is impacting their life beyond the surface.\nBenefits \u2013 increasing the desire to reach the solution, making motivation sustainable if these are repeated.\nAwareness \u2013 The amount of people who suffer from the problem, can benefit from the solution, and are ready to receive the clarity to act.\nIf I want to sell a new product to earn a creative income, here\u2019s how I would map it out.\nProblem \u2013 I hate working long hours.\nGoal \u2013 Work for 4 hours a day.\nProcess \u2013 Start a business, learn the required skills, and focus on high-leverage tasks (you can and should get detailed with this).\nThis helps me frame the content I write to help others adopt the same perspective.\nAll of these can be used as individual social posts, outlines for a newsletter or video script, and anything else that requires you to illustrate your value.\nConcept\nExample: The 4 Hour Workday.\nWhen you name a concept, like \u201cThe Eisenhower Matrix\u201d or \u201c1% Better Every Day,\u201d you increase your likelihood of making people remember you.\nI use concepts like the One Person Business or The Value Equation (for this letter) to bring a novel perspective to a boring topic that will change people\u2019s lives.\nThis works well for headlines, video titles, or hooks to catch attention.\nProof\nExample: I\u2019ve helped John Smith prioritize tasks to work less and increase revenue.\nIn my newsletters, I often start with a problem based on my personal experience and how I overcame it. This gives people the belief and relatability to do it as well.\nUse whatever you can \u2013 statistics, client stories, or personal experience \u2013 to show what\u2019s possible.\nRisk reversal\nExample: You only need 10 minutes each day to start.\nPeople need clarity more than they need motivation. How can you reduce the perceived risk and friction to make a change?\nIn marketing, people use money back guarantees.\nIn writing, I attempt to make things so stupidly clear they don\u2019t have an excuse to remain mediocre.\nI teach you how to write to build an audience (to distribute your value for profit) in 2 Hour Writer.\nPain points\nExample: You don\u2019t have time for family. You don\u2019t have time to pursue other goals. You don\u2019t have meaningful work to focus on.\nOn my landing pages, I start with a bullet list of pain points to make people realize the impact of their problem. This opens a curiosity loop and makes their mind desire a solution.\nRemember that the examples I give are one of many. All of these are to be treated as creative firepower for your creations.\nBenefits\nExample: Choose when you work. Choose what you work on. Choose who you work with.\nHere\u2019s an example social post I could write using benefits. This is what most people should start writing to establish authority in their topic of choice:\nYou started a business because you want to:\nChoose when you work\nChoose what you work on\nChoose who you work with\nDon\u2019t forget: entrepeneurship isn\u2019t about working long hours.\nIt\u2019s about taking control of your time, money, and enjoyment.\n(I\u2019m scheduling this as a post right now, go to my profile to see if it did well. Notice how there is an implied problem, goal, and process that people will learn if they follow me.)\nThat can be a part of a sales page, newsletter, or used as a social post to prime readers for your value.\nAwareness\nThere are 5 levels of awareness:\nLevel 1: Unaware of the problem.\nLevel 2: Problem aware.\nLevel 3: Solution aware.\nLevel 4: Product aware.\nLevel 5: Most aware.\nMost people will fall between levels 1-4.\nYour job is to speak to each level at various stages of your bio, content, website, emails, DMs, calls, and the rest until they are aware that your product (or value) is the one they need to implement.\nIf someone is in level 2 (problem aware), here\u2019s a post I would write as an example for The 4 Hour Workday concept:\nIf you hate working long hours:\nAdd to your skill set\nFinally start a business\nWork on it for 1 hour each day\nFire your boss from your life\nWork whenever you want\nYou will never work less if you don\u2019t create your own way of doing so.\nNotice how I used a \u201cprocess\u201d to give them a solution to the problem.\nUse the value equation to fill holes in your mind, business, and life.\nIf you want personalized guidance to become a synthesizer (or value creator) as a career for 12-16 weeks, apply for Kortex University.\nThe Lifestyle Of The 1%\nThere is one lifestyle that all high-value individuals have.\nThey reverse entropy on a daily basis.\nThey pursue goals on a daily basis.\nThey solve problems on a daily basis.\nThey hypothesize, test, and create solutions to distribute to others on a daily basis.\nThis lifestyle demands constant learning, building, and distributing of value.\nValue is reversing entropy.\nEntropy is the decline into chaos.\nEntropy is reversed by creating systems to achieve goals by solving problems. That\u2019s the Value Equation.\nThere is one career that will never go out of style: earning in accordance with nature. That is to say, reversing entropy by solving an endless series of problems, turning the solutions into potential profit, and distributing the value you create to others.\nNo matter where the economy goes, no matter how many jobs AGI replaces, no matter how worried you are\u2026 because that worry is just a problem that others also suffer from, you can solve for all parties, and profit handsomely from with education and meaning content and products.\nNobody is going to give you the time, you must take it.\nStart with 1 hour every morning before the distractions wake up.\nSolve a problem in your life that births a profitable solution.\nBuild an audience by distributing your value with writing and content.\nTurn your solution into a product and iterate until you make as much as you want.\nDon\u2019t rely on a paycheck for your survival.\nTranscend your survival through entrepreneurship and remove the earning limit from your life.\nAnd lastly, enjoy the rest of your week.\nDan"

Deep in your core.\nWe all have access to Nature\u2019s Compass.\nNature\u2019s Compass\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want, you will be told what you want, and you will believe it. \u2013 The Art of Focus\nHow to do whatever you want:\nDo what you want, but don\u2019t ignore the consequences of your actions.\nYou have to do what you think you want to realize what you don\u2019t want. You have to remove what you don\u2019t want to do what you really want.\nIt is impossible to know with absolute certainty what is going to happen in the future.\nThis is why the masses flock to \u201csecure\u201d jobs and belief systems.\nIt\u2019s an illusion of certainty to avoid struggle. You can\u2019t skip making mistakes. Mistakes are your light in the dark. Mistakes reveal problems to be solved. Problems are the limits on your mind.\nAs Einstein said, \u201cYou can\u2019t solve a problem with the same mind that created it.\u201d\nMost people skip that part.\nThey think they want a nice car, cushy job, and to travel the world \u2013 but once they do those things, the superficial shine fades fast.\nThey continue convincing themselves that\u2019s the life they want, never evolve, never pursue anything deeper, and never get what they really want.\nThat is, they never get what their nature wants, not what their ego wants.\nTo get what you want out of life:\nPursue what you think you want\nRealize what you don\u2019t want\nBecome aware of that problem\nSit with it, study it, dissect it\nExpand your mind to see beyond it\nSolve the problem to evolve one level\nRepeat the process until you reach the essence of life itself\nThere is absolutely no set path that someone can give you to accomplish this.\nPeople can give you direction with advice and tips, but they can\u2019t act, think, or solve problems for you.\nYou don\u2019t know what you want out of life because you haven\u2019t tried anything.\nYou\u2019re not getting results because you don\u2019t have the skill required to get those results.\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible because you haven\u2019t exposed yourself to the perspective that makes it possible.\nWhat you want right now may be completely different tomorrow, or next month, or next year.\nNothing lasts forever. Meaning is found in endless problem-solving until you drill so deep you find what you are looking for.\nThis is normal. This is life.\nThe Macro Cycle Of Life \u2013 Why You Always Feel Lost\nYou feel lost because you don\u2019t know what to do next.\nYou don\u2019t know what to do next because you don\u2019t have a goal.\nYou don\u2019t have a goal (that you care about) because you aren\u2019t aware of a problem that demands your focus.\nStop worrying about setting goals until you identify the next problem you want to solve in your life.\nLife unfolds in chapters, phases, and cycles.\nYour life is a story.\nYour year is a story.\nYour day is a story.\nEach of them have a series of goals, problems, highs, and lows that may repeat themselves as time passes.\nThere is one macrocycle of life.\nOnce you understand it, you can identify which part of the story you are in, become aware of its components, and ease your mind until you enter the next phase.\nThe cycle is composed of 3 phases:\nYou feel lost. You don\u2019t know what to pursue next. You\u2019ve solved a problem, achieved a goal, and thought it was the end.\nYou become curious. You experiment with different topics, interests, and ideas until you become fully aware of the problem you want to solve.\nYou become obsessed. You dive deeper into the crevice of reality of your choice. You can\u2019t stop learning and building toward your goal.\nWhen you feel lost, you must force yourself to experiment in 2 directions:\n1) Experiment Inward\nRest. Nap. Journal. Walk. Embrace silence.\nObserve and deconstruct your thoughts.\nAttempt to catch a signal of opportunity.\nFollow your thoughts to a root problem.\n2) Experiment Outward\nLearn. Read. Scroll. Build. Try new things.\nRefocus on the only things that matter in life.\nHealth, wealth, relationships, happiness.\nExperiment with techniques that invest energy into a goal. Any goal.\nDuring the experimentation phase, you are trying to accumulate new experience until your next quest becomes visible.\nLike a video game, you are at a point where the quest isn\u2019t unlocked, but you don\u2019t have any other to pursue. You have to fumble around in the dark until you find a candle off in the distance.\nNote: avoid labeling this as shiny object syndrome.\nMy business today is only possible because I tried and \u201cfailed\u201d at 7 different business models. In reflection, those failures were periods of skill stacking, problem solving, and increasing my awareness surface area for the right opportunities.\nNow, understand that there is no time limit for this phase.\nIt could last weeks, months, or years.\nYou must stick it out until you accumulate enough vision to stop going wide and start going deep.\nWhen you find your obsession, experimentation doesn\u2019t stop.\n3) Experiment Downward\nThe secret is to try everything until you find that one thing that you can\u2019t pull yourself away from. Then, once it becomes a normal part of your life, repeat the process.\nWhen you find that one thing, go deep.\nLearn everything you can about that domain.\nDissect all perspectives and avoid becoming dogmatic about one.\nIn nutrition, collect truth from veganism, keto, carnivore, Ray Peat, flexible dieting, and other ideologies until you are confident enough to create your own that is closer to truth. Truth is a process not a commandment.\nIn business, collect truth from e-commerce, freelancing, software, and other models until you note the principles that bring clarity to your own endeavors.\nSelf-experimentation is the only way to solve your problems for good.\nPeople can diagnose and prescribe a solution to your problems, but that lacks regard for the difference in perspective, goals, and experience from those prescribing the solutions.\n4) Experiment Upward\nPersistence and iteration.\nI\u2019m assuming that once you\u2019ve found your obsession you want to make it a consistent part of your life.\nThis means you must earn a creative income from that interest.\nIn today\u2019s world, that means:\nBuilding a project to spread to help others solve their problems.\nTeaching in public to attract people with those problems.\nSelling your project so you can continue pursuing your obsession.\nImproving your project as you learn what can only be learned through feedback.\nEvolving to a new project when you\u2019ve reached the level that can only be reached through business.\nThere are many ways to do this. Experiment.\nBut I can tell you with confidence, through my experimentation, that the creator economy is the \u201cmost true\u201d model to follow considering human nature and the future of work.\nThe Digital Renaissance\nWe are living through a second Golden Age and it belongs to those who value:\nSelf-education\nSelf-experimentation\nMultidisciplinary study\nDigital leverage\nSkill acquisition\nBuilding your own thing\nIf you want to thrive, become a digital renaissance man.\nHere\u2019s what you do:\nJoin The New Society\nSocial media is not just an app on your phone.\nIt is a decentralized public school, marketplace, and podium but only for those who value personal responsibility. You aren\u2019t forced to be a part of this society, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important.\nYou no longer need startup capital to start a business.\nYou no longer need a job board to find a career.\nYou no longer need a publisher to launch a book.\nYou no longer need a record label to make music.\nYou no longer need formal education to become an expert.\nYou no longer need religious institutions to feed you meaning.\nThe centralized authority over learning, meaning, and earning is only a thing for those who are still asleep.\nAll you need is an internet connection, social media account, and the courage to teach, fail, improve, and persist.\nI teach this in 2 Hour Writer & Digital Economics.\nBecome Valuable\nEveryone tells you to become valuable but nobody tells you what value is.\nValue is the relationship between what you do, why you do it, how you do it, and who benefits from that equation.\nValue is composed of 4 parts.\nProblem \u2013 A limitation or challenge that creates pain when unsolved.\nSolution \u2013 An impactful end result that allows the recipient to evolve beyond the problem.\nClarity \u2013 A creative system that breeds knowledge, skill, and awareness to bridge the gap between problem and solution.\nPeople \u2013 The amount of people that suffer from the problem, can benefit from the solution, and are ready to receive the clarity to act.\nValue is experience exchange.\nValue is the impact of your story.\nSo, to make a creative income, our job is to gain experience by solving the problems that prevent our evolution and pass down the condensed wisdom to those who are ready to receive it.\n1) Unveil Problems With An Anti-Vision\nIt\u2019s easier to know what you don\u2019t want \u2013 from experience \u2013 than it is to know what you want \u2013 from imagination.\nSo, create an anti-vision for your future.\nKeep a running note that you will add to as you observe life:\nWhat do you not want to look like?\nHow do you not want to feel?\nWhat does your worst day look like?\nWhat qualities do you not want in your friends, customers, partner, and co-workers?\nHow much money isn\u2019t enough to survive?\nHow does everything above spread into each area of your life and prevent you from doing what you want?\nHit on the things that matter. Health, wealth, relationships, and happiness. Those are the eternal markets in business. If you build a creative solution for a problem within those domains, you won\u2019t have a problem making a living from your experience.\n2) Identify Solutions With A Vision\nYou now have a plethora of problems to solve to gradually increase your value.\nPick one. Solve it. Move on to the next. Meaning is found not in the achievement of a goal, but in solving the endless string of problems that pull you deeper into the nature of reality.\nNow, to increase your desire to solve it, create a vision for your ideal future.\nWrite out the opposite of everything you listed for your anti-vision.\nTreat this as a Minimum Viable Vision. You will add to it with time. What you want will change as you do.\n3) Learn & Build For Clarity\nDon\u2019t learn to build, build to learn.\nYou\u2019ve chosen a problem you want to solve in your life. This could be related to fitness, finances, freedom, or anything else that is preventing you from living the life you want.\nWith that problem in mind, laser in on one big goal.\nBut remember, goals don\u2019t start out magnetic. You probably don\u2019t care about the goal.\nYou must invest energy into the goal until you feel as if you are wasting resources for not achieving it. Your goal must frame your perspective for enough time to register reasons to continue pursuing it.\nYou don\u2019t develop an intrinsic philosophy in a day.\nYou develop it through conversations, reading, listening, and filtering reality until you stack enough \u201cwhys\u201d to hold you accountable.\nYou will fail. That\u2019s the only way to identify what you need to learn next.\nWhen you do fail, reframe it immediately as a knowledge gap.\nUse the failure as a new frame to filter your experiences for answers.\n4) Attract People With Your Story\nBe a failure.\nLaunch the project to a crowd of crickets. Publish your thoughts and get called a fool. Start the venture and watch people criticize your first moves.\nEveryone else did it. You aren\u2019t a special case.\nInvest in your portfolio of failures until you can afford to succeed.\nYour portfolio of failures is your story.\nLike a movie, people are interested more in the lows than the highs.\nYou attract people and profit to you when you have the solution to a problem in your life.\nDistribute Your Value\nThe greatest skill is writing because:\nIt forces you to articulate your value\nIt is the foundation of all media\nIt can be repurposed into any other medium\nAny other skill you acquire enhances it\nIt brings immense mental clarity\nLearn to write.\nIt takes time to realize that writing is the highest leverage work.\nYou must synthesize your value into impactful ideas that live in the heads of others rent free and influence their thoughts and behaviors.\nYou do this by writing emails, content, guides, and products with persistent and iterative effort.\nWriting is the foundation of communication.\nCommunication is how you distribute value.\nDistributing value is how you attract people.\nIf you don\u2019t attract people, you will never have someone else in the value exchange process.\nThis isn\u2019t a job where someone hands you a paycheck for completing mechanical tasks that will be replaced.\nThis is a purpose that must be shared by another in order to earn a creative income.\nI\u2019ve discussed this in previous letters, please go search for them, or we walk you through it inside Kortex University to become a synthesizer in 16 weeks.\nThank you for reading this letter.\nI hope it helped.\nDan"

        "heading": "You Are Obligated To Get Rich In Your 20s",
        "content": "I always felt bad for wanting to make money.\nThere was an unconscious stigma that it was an evil thing to do. That\u2019s all you hear others \u2013 who haven\u2019t done much with their life \u2013 preach.\nI didn\u2019t realize money could be a vessel for spiritual growth.\nTo start this letter:\nDon\u2019t feel bad for wanting to make money.\nIt is the tool that allows you to fulfill your basic needs. It is a necessity for survival. Most people reject the need, not want, for money and lock themselves into a narrow-minded existence.\nMoney is a tool to solve problems.\nProblems are limits on your mind and potential. When you solve a real problem and pass down the solution, you contribute to the evolution of humanity.\nStarting a business is one of the most spiritual things you can do.\nYou are spiritually obligated to get rich in your 20s because money \u2013 in today\u2019s world \u2013 is a barrier to personal development. Higher stages of consciousness are difficult to achieve without your basic needs met and meaningful work to focus your attention.\nWithout money, you may get trapped in the default lifestyle of going to school, working a job you hate, marrying a spouse you don\u2019t care about, and waking up one day wondering where the time went.\nBusiness As A Vessel For Spiritual Growth\nYou are being attracted to your highest version, and the depth of your core can sense it. The external call to evolve requires you to chisel inward beneath the mental constructs that have been layered through your conditioning. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nThe big problem:\nMost people reject the pursuit of material objects because they can\u2019t see beyond the material object.\nSomeone can buy a fancy car on impulse, but it doesn\u2019t have to remain a materialistic pursuit.\nThey can grow to become obsessed with the depth of the car itself. They can study its parts, turn it into a career, and use it as a portal into the flow state.\nLesson: superficial pursuits can birth metaphysical meaning.\nSomeone can start a business in the pursuit of status and money, but that same business can introduce them to the depth of skill, customer results, and the inner workings of their mind required to run that business. They fall in love with that crevice of reality, and that crevice of reality teaches them about reality itself.\nThe pursuit of money almost always starts as superficial.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing to do.\nIt may be the only way to expose yourself to depth.\nLike lifting weights. You start for the vanity and stay for the therapy.\nWhen you find the intersection of:\nWhat allows you to survive\nWhat you enjoy doing every day\nWhat helps other people improve\nLife becomes meaningful and abundant.\nYes, there are \u201cbad\u201d parts that come with making money.\nJust like there are \u201cbad\u201d lyrics of a song.\nWelcome to life. You will never get rid of the bad. You just learn to zoom out, nurture a strong vision for the future, and make sure the overarching narrative creates heaven, not hell.\nMost people never reach this stage because they can\u2019t pursue a goal until passion is developed.\nYou don\u2019t start out passionate.\nYou become passionate according to the amount of energy you invest in the goal.\nAll pursuits are materialistic until a philosophical sense of mastery is formed. Then, it becomes their vehicle into the unknown to expand and evolve. Like a relationship, you are attracted by their looks (95% of the time) and are only then introduced to the depth of their being.\nLooks, in all domains of life, are as important as depth. The problem is when people never dive deeper. They bounce around on the surface like a distracted dopamine junkie.\nTheir mind plays the familiar past and known future on repeat.\nThey live out that same experience and never solve the problems that live in their head rent-free. The problems that must be solved to evolve beyond their current mind and situation.\nEventually, you have to kick those mental tenants out and allow new ones to occupy it.\nEvery external problem requires an internal problem to be solved.\nYour mind, your customers minds, and the Universe itself fall into chaos if you do not pursue a what-could-be superficial goal to reverse entropy.\nYou aren\u2019t where you want to be because you haven\u2019t solved the problem that unlocks your next level of mind.\nMoney Is A Spiritual Energy \u2013 The Decentralized New Economy\nMost people don\u2019t understand what spirituality is.\nThey are attracted to it because it promises to ease their suffering, they misinterpret, and get attached to a new identity of long hair and hippy clothes to feel special (and potentially more noble) than others.\nSpirituality is your connection to something greater than yourself.\nSpirituality is becoming one with the whole you are a part of.\nSports can be spiritual because you are at one with the team. This is called \u201cteam spirit.\u201d\nWork can be spiritual because you are at one with the impact of your work. \u201cFlow state\u201d is often described as a spiritual experience.\nSpirituality is the dissolution of the limits that compose your self.\nBusiness gives you a reason to be spiritual.\nIt exposes you to new problems that demand a new perspective to navigate.\nMost people are stuck in the same place as they were 10 years ago. They don\u2019t need to read more on spirituality, they need to challenge themselves so they are forced to develop themselves to the point of needing spirituality to reach the next stage.\nShifting to a spiritual perspective allows you to understand money as energy that fuels growth, expansion, and evolution by solving problems.\nTo \u201cshift to a spiritual perspective\u201d is to zoom out and observe reality.\nWhen you do, you notice patterns of nature:\nUnity and division\nCreation and destruction\nCentralization and decentralization\nAs above, so below.\nReality is the ultimate mental model. This spiritual perspective is the \u201csecret\u201d behind the rich and successful. They apply the patterns of nature to their everyday actions. They observe the markets, understand their direction, and make sound decisions based on that.\nOne big pattern few people have caught onto is the shift from corporation to individual.\nFreelancers compose 46.6% of the workforce (increasing substantially from 36% in 2020).\nThe creator economy is projected to double from $250B to $480B by 2028. People think they are late to the party when it\u2019s just getting started.\nThe economy favors profitable business models. Tech enabled businesses like creators can operate at 95% profit margins with digital products and services \u2013 causing more development in that domain for new platforms and tools.\nBig companies are requiring leaders at their company to be active on social media for brand reputation. Less corporate marketing, more human marketing.\nCorporations are beginning to opt for contractors and creators as workers and marketers.\nOur team at Kortex is contractor and creator-fueled. We have no employees. We generate traffic with creator audiences and give our team flexible workdays with contract work.\nFrom a spiritual perspective, it\u2019s not difficult to see the security in turning your authentic self into a business.\nThe Creator Philosophy \u2013 It\u2019s Not Just A Fancy Internet Job, It\u2019s A Way Of Life\nThe creator philosophy is not a business model, but a way of life.\nImprove yourself, improve others who want to be helped.\nSolve your own problems, sell the solution.\nMaster yourself, master the world.\nHere are the steps that you can start acting on today:\n1) Master Your Survival (Solve Your Own Problems)\nYou can\u2019t sustain authenticity when you need something from someone else.\nMoney is a tool to remove dependencies that make you inauthentic.\nEvery single individual on this earth has to self-actualize in order to contribute to humanity in the best way they can. And, humanity is only as strong as its weakest link. A business allows you to encounter true problems, solve them, and pass down products that expand the mind\u2019s of others.\nWhile this can be done with the perfect career path, that\u2019s not what I can help with. Nor is it something that you have full control over.\nEntrepreneurship is modern-day survival.\nWe hunt for resources (money, in the modern sense) to fulfill our needs and create work that we enjoy. And if we don\u2019t enjoy certain aspects, a business allows you to eliminate, delegate, or automate that aspect of work.\nMy recommendation is still the same as all of my letters:\nSolve the superficial problems in your life\nBecome multidimensionally jacked (mind, body, money, and relationships)\nDiscover your deeper interests and obsessions through improvement and building\nDocument your journey and solutions with content and products on the internet\n95% of people\u2019s problems revolve around health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nIf you can solve those problems in your own life and document the solution, you can charge for the knowledge you acquire.\nWe discussed this in the last letter Zero To $1 Million As A One-Person Business.\nIndividuals don\u2019t learn best from someone 10 steps ahead of them, but from someone that is 1 step ahead of them.\n2) Create Your Own Philosophy\nThere is enough shallow advice on how to make money, how to get laid, and various bandaids you can apply to your mental health.\nWe need more individuals who are truth seekers.\nThe individuals who understand that prescribed step-by-step advice looks good on the outside, but is hollow on the inside.\nWe need more people who attack the root of the problem, which is often metaphysical, spiritual, or epistemological.\nThe world is desperate for depth, and that can only be created by forging your own path.\nPhilosophy is based on experience.\nDepth is created through experimentation and obsession.\nYou must experiment with different skills and interests until you find the one that makes business spiritual for you. The one you can\u2019t stop digging deeper into. Document your journey on the internet (the collective consciousness) for everyone to learn from.\nYou have to set your mind on an ideal future, pursue it wholeheartedly, make mistakes, note your lessons, and correct your actions with a sustainable solution.\nYour philosophy is a proposed worldview and lifestyle for the good life.\nWhat are the skills, beliefs, and habits people need to be educated on?\nFor my own philosophy of work less, earn more, enjoy life \u2013 people need marketing, sales, writing, complementary marketable skills, a growth mindset, a passion for the metaphysical, daily movement, daily writing, daily problem-solving, and daily rest. That is what all of my content is based around.\nThat is what I teach in 2 Hour Writer and Digital Economics.\nIt won\u2019t apply to everyone. That\u2019s the point.\nYour job is to attract people like you and let others attract people like them.\n3) Turn It Into A Public School\nI\u2019m convinced that the future of schooling will be done online, with creators as teachers, and each student can join the \u201cschool\u201d that aligns the most with their interests, values, and preferred method of learning. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nOne school system shouldn\u2019t dominate 12+ years of someones life.\nStudents should evolve beyond one creator-based \u201cschool\u201d after a few years, go on to the next, and eventually be able to start their own \u2013 if the other schools have the underlying principle of critical thinking and personal experience.\nMake it your life\u2019s work to create a library of knowledge and share it online under your brand, or school, with an underlying philosophy that attracts the right people.\nYour public school is digital real estate.\nTwitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to attract a broad audience.\nYouTube, podcasting, and a blog or newsletter to educate and nurture the audience.\nAnd a host of products, from low-cost courses to memberships to high-cost tailored coaching.\nThis is what I\u2019ve dedicated myself to teaching because I see the opportunity in the space.\nEventually, you will gain the resources to start whatever kind of business you want to further your message.\nWe guide you through this in Kortex University to start your digital career in 90 days.\nThe Holistic Synthesizer \u2013 A Meaningful Career\nUnder this philosophy, the creator economy cannot get saturated because:\n1) Your Community Evolves\nWhen you don\u2019t subscribe to a specific label, niche, or compartment of reality that limits what you are capable of, the only option is to evolve.\nHumans and communities do not stick to one purpose.\nOnce you actualize that goal, you move on to the next that reveals itself.\n2) Your Products Evolve\nI started out as a web designer, my products and services revolved around that.\nAs I developed myself and my business, I transitioned into different skills and interests.\nMy products followed suit, and I effectively desaturated the web design market under me.\n3) Unique Webs Of Interests\nWhen you lean into your genuine combination of interests that compose your philosophy, your brand ceases to be compartmentalized.\nSomeone who talks about fitness, business, and tech is still vastly different from someone who talks about fitness, business, and spirituality.\n4) Large Creators Have Ample Resources\nIt is not rare to see a large creator decrease output on all fronts.\nGo and look at a YouTuber with over 1 million subscribers.\n~50% of the time, you will see that they barely post, or they stop posting altogether.\nThe same goes for X creators. Huge accounts often decrease to posting a few times a week.\nThis gives new creators the ability to flood the market, generate more attention, and create the network and resources without much competition from the \u201cbig players.\u201d\nThe big players go on to pursue a new purpose, like starting a family or building a separate company with the leverage they now have.\nThe Demand For Depth\nWe\u2019ve reached a critical point in the creator economy.\nContent platforms have been saturated with basic, shallow, and regurgitated ideas for the sake of growth.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad, and still works to grow an account, but my question is\u2026 why?\nWhy over-systemize ideas?\nWhy strip the soul from your business?\nWhy prioritize growth, revenue, and shallow impact over everything?\nWhy limit the only thing that can set you apart as an individual: your creative ability?\nThe general level of awareness in the space is rising.\nThe market will demand that creators rise above generic quotes and the same old step-by-step self-help advice.\nThis can only be done when you prioritize depth, perspective, and holistic synthesis.\nThe Holistic Synthesizer\nLet\u2019s define what a \u201cholistic synthesizer\u201d is:\nSomeone who pursues their own vision and forges their path with the unique skills and interests they acquire. They do not view those skills or interests as individual parts, but as an interconnected whole that are necessary aspects of their life (not temporary pieces for quick cash grabs). Their life\u2019s work is to distill, educate, and distribute their personal experience on the path.\nIn short, a holistic synthesizer who documents their pursuit of the good life in a persuasive and educational manner.\nThat way, you can attract the community that resonates with your voice, help them reach their shared goals, and not limit yourself to a compartmentalized aspect of reality.\nYour brand is your philosophy \u2013 how does one live the good life?\nYour content is your school \u2013 what skill set and mindset do they need?\nYour product is the map \u2013 a holistic system that helps people get to where you are with less trial and error\nIn a more practical sense, here\u2019s how to get started:\n1) Identify A Desirable Goal\nWhat is one big goal in your life that you are trying to achieve, or have achieved?\nAre you fit? Have you acquired a skill (like writing)? Have you understood the nature of reality? What is it? What have you accomplished, no matter how small or insignificant you think it is?\nThe key with this:\nDon\u2019t focus on the goal itself, but on the lifestyle it has created for you.\n2) Identify Your Starting Point\nWhat made you want to change?\nWhat was the burning problem in your life?\nWhat did your life look like before the goal?\nMarketing is about transformations.\nYou are helping others go from point A (where you were) to point B (the desirable goal).\n3) Outline A Unique Path\nNow, outline modules, chapters, or steps necessary to get from point A to point B.\nYou are at a point in life where you can look back and help others navigate the mistakes you made.\nAct like you are outlining a book.\nFill in the blanks with everything people need to know, learn, and do in order to reach the goal. Think skill set and mind set.\nThe internet has given you the power to self-educate much faster than any human has ever been able to.\nTake it upon yourself to improve your life, pursue your curiosity, and share your discoveries.\nIs there anything better you could be doing?\nBefore you go off and start a billion-dollar tech company, consider starting with the only thing that matters:\nImproving the one thing that every human must improve to evolve: the quality of their human experience.\nWhen more people master their personal lives, they can put the creative ability of their minds together to work on global problems.\nBy the point you do this, you will know what to do.\nYou will become a large creator that pursues new avenues and desaturates the market beneath them.\nThank you for reading this letter.\nDan"

        "content": "If you\u2019ve solved a problem in your life, you\u2019re qualified to start a business.\nNot just any business.\nAn education business.\nAs one person.\nWith close-to-zero startup costs.\nWith the knowledge you already have in your head (regardless of experience level).\nMost people try to build a \u201cstartup\u201d or some crazy idea they came up with after a night of drinking with their friends.\nThey think their idea will change the world, but they\u2019re usually delusional because they don\u2019t have any prior business experience.\nIf you\u2019ve had the idea with zero experience (meaning your mind can only have so many good ideas\u2026 you haven\u2019t built anything that leads to better ideas) then I can almost guarantee someone has already tried and failed with it.\nThere are special cases of course, but it\u2019s better not to bank on luck here.\nThere\u2019s a reason people are making millions solving fitness, productivity, career, money, relationships, and lifestyle problems:\nBecause every person has them.\nBecause they prevent the average individual from doing the only thing they want\u2026 enjoying life.\nWhat better (and more profitable) problem is there to solve than one you experience every day?\nSolve Your Own Problems & Sell The Solution\nIf you\u2019ve gotten results in fitness, sell a fitness program.\nIf you\u2019ve gotten results with focus, sell a productivity course.\nIf you\u2019ve gotten results with a skill, sell a tutorial.\nThe list goes on.\n\u201cDan, everyone is selling an information product nowadays\u2026 it seems like a scam.\u201d\nAgain with the lack of perspective. You don\u2019t have the experience that allows you to make sense of the industry.\nIt also shows that you don\u2019t understand Business 101: sell what\u2019s already selling. Especially if you\u2019re just starting out. Don\u2019t chase blue oceans, there\u2019s a reason money isn\u2019t flowing there and you aren\u2019t smarter than Mother Nature.\nThe school system is failing.\nEducation is the foundation of humanity.\nCreators are the decentralized school system.\nYou complain so much about how \u201c[insert any real-world problem here] should be taught in schools!\u201d\nNow that it is, at a fraction of the cost of formal education (if not free) on the internet, and can only be built out by a vast number of individuals who solve their own problems with direct experience\u2026 you call it a scam.\nThe only scam is you not taking responsibility for your future with the plethora of information available to you outside of schools.\nOn Experience & Imposter Syndrome:\nPeople learn best from those who are similar to them.\nI used to think fat personal trainers were a silly concept, but I don\u2019t think the average individual wants to be trained by a bodybuilder. They\u2019d be insecure the whole time and can\u2019t resonate with their identity.\nIn short: students will get better results by learning from someone a few steps ahead of them.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you aren\u2019t a productivity guru with a billion-dollar company.\nIt does matter if you can focus for 2 hours and help someone who can only focus for 15 minutes.\nImposter syndrome is solved with honesty.\nYour marketing strategy should be solely based around where you are in your journey and exactly what you help others with.\nThe industry has enough false and attention-grabbing promises.\nIn a market of extremes, if you want to be outstanding, all you have to do is be average.\nEducation Businesses Are The Future Of Schooling\nWe\u2019re going to see 10 person billion dollar companies pretty soon. In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there\u2019s this betting pool for the first year where there\u2019s a 1 person billion dollar company. Which would have been unimaginable without AI. \u2013 Sam Altman\nYou don\u2019t need statistics to observe reality.\nThe main pattern of reality is division and reunion.\nCentralization and decentralization.\nIn The Art Of Focus, I illustrate the uncommon sense of the rain cycle. We all know it, but we often see it as a superficial process of life rather than an indicator of life itself.\nThe ocean evaporates into divided droplets, reunifies in the clouds, divides into rain, and rain continues dividing and reuniting in plant life, our homes, and more.\nThis happens in all dimensions and scales of reality.\nIn my prediction, backed by 4.5 billion years of evolution, the centralized school and economy are decentralizing thanks to the emergence of new technology.\nThe internet, code, and now AI have allowed for the creator economy.\nComprised of one-person businesses educating, entertaining, and inspiring the masses (while making thousands to millions a year doing so).\nThe conventional education and employment path doesn\u2019t make sense anymore.\nHumanity needs education, but not some idealized and regimented form that antagonizes the wiring of our psyche and makes us hate learning \u2013 the one thing that fuels all areas of your life.\nFrom corporation to individual (yes, public schools are corporations) reality is decentralizing. Individuals who realize this can hop on one of the most profitable shifts in history.\nThe Massive Evolutionary Problem: Labor Work\nThe objective of work is usually to sustain our lives biologically, an objective we share with other animals. But the objective of leisure can and should be to sustain other aspects of our lives which make us uniquely human: our souls, our minds, our personal and civic relationships. Leisure is therefore wasted if we do not use it purposively. \u2013 Aristotle\nWork is a financial necessity.\nFinances are a necessity for survival.\nMoney is not to be demonized, but earned and used as a spiritual energy.\nWork and rest should not be seen as distinct opposites but complementary.\nCreative work is the future in a tech-enhanced society.\nEvolution is problem-solving to reverse entropy, and humans have been solving problems that make their life miserable since the dawn of time.\nWe want to avoid suffering, so we\u2019ve built technology that allows us to do what nature calls us to do: pursue personal development, expand our sense of self, and do meaningful work that allows others to do the same.\n\u201cWe need more plumbers and construction workers!\u201d\nI agree, but at some point, maybe in our lifetime, those jobs will not exist.\nShould everyone bank on creative work as the only path to meaningful work that doesn\u2019t have an income cap? No. But smart people should.\nWith the advancements in robotics, and factories like Tesla being over 75% automated, I don\u2019t see why robots can\u2019t completely solve the problem that has plagued humanity for a long time. It also doesn\u2019t seem far off that we will have personal robots doing our laundry, cleaning our houses, and automating labor-intensive tasks so we can focus on creative work and self-actualization.\nYes, I\u2019m sure some pleasure seekers will end up in VR headsets with Coca Cola mainlined into their bloodstream, but wise people who flow with nature would never submit to that life. Success is reserved for the creative.\nYour psyche craves creativity. It feels good to create. By all measures, creating something of your own lights your brain on fire. That is enough of a sign that humans are meant to do this.\nMy proposed way of life is using the internet as a creative extension of yourself:\nLearn skills that can\u2019t be taught in schools\nSolve your own problems for personal evolution\nGet results that can\u2019t be achieved in employment\nPut your personality on the internet to attract people like you\nHelp them solve their problems for collective evolution\nEarn a meaningful independent income doing so\nThis is not another dogmatic business model, this is a way of life.\nTo become a vessel of creativity that solves problems (or removes limitations) in your own life and others. Most people still see the internet as a shallow place to numb your mind when it is the digital world is the next stage of consciousness.\nI\u2019ve written about this extensively in the past and break \u201chow to do it\u201d down in 2-Hour Writer and, if you have a skill set and value to provide \u2013 we help you even more over 16 weeks in Kortex University.\nIn the context of this letter, you need to know how you can turn your skills and interests into an education business:\nSell a tutorial (tutoring) \u2013 Sell a beginner-level tutorial of a specific skill, practice, or interest. Web design, building cars, Photoshop, guitar.\nSell a program (coaching) \u2013 Sell an action plan or program that people can adopt as a daily routine. Fitness, productivity, self-improvement, etc.\nSell a system (consulting or freelancing) \u2013 Sell a system that people can implement into their work or business. Lead generation, content creation, etc.\nObserve the people who are doing what you want to do.\nReverse engineer how they are doing it. Buy their courses. Dissect their funnel. Study their content. Educate yourself along the way so you can understand what they are actually doing.\nKoe\u2019s Law \u2013 Work Evolves To Earn More In Less Time\nKoe\u2019s Law: work evolves to earn more in the time allotted for its completion. This demands creativity, growth, and skill acquisition to solve problems that prevent this evolution.\nWe\u2019ve all heard of Parkinson\u2019s Law.\nThat work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.\nBut that\u2019s only the first layer. Your work expands, but your income doesn\u2019t.\nThe 4-hour workday has been my philosophy for quite some time.\nWhat people don\u2019t realize is that with technology you can work that same amount of time while making as much money as you want.\nThe problem is that people get trapped in business ideologies.\nThey start as a freelancer, that\u2019s all they know, they bias freelancing above other models, and complain when they can\u2019t escape the feast or famine cycle with just enough income to survive.\nBecause they identify as a freelancer, their mind can\u2019t open beyond that to perceive opportunities that allow them to better leverage their skill set.\nThey left the 9-5 to pursue freedom and created a new 9-5 for themselves.\nLet\u2019s break down how Koe\u2019s Law works in practical steps to evolve from $100K per year to $100K per month.\nStage 1) Start With Client Work\nAs one person without an audience, client work is the best option.\nYou can use manual client acquisition strategies and charge between $1000 and $10,000+ per client.\nYou only need 2-3 clients to replace your income.\nIn my eyes, it\u2019s best to skip the freelancer stage and go straight to coaching, consulting, or tutoring as illustrated in the last section. Because education and teaching are pillars of the good life, it makes sense to integrate them in your work.\nYour time is allocated as such in a 4-hour time frame:\n1 hour per day prospecting for new clients\n3-5 hours per week on sales calls\n2-4 hours per week on client calls\n1 hour per day writing content for audience and clients\nThe rest is filled with pour-over from any of these\nThe key is to hold the intention of evolution in your mind so you don\u2019t get trapped in this stage.\nStage 2) Build An Audience & Evolve One Layer\nAs a client business, you can only take on so many clients with 4 hours of work.\nAnd if you want to stay as one person, you need to identify the route that allows you to maintain that work time without hiring employees.\nI\u2019ve discovered this route for you, so you don\u2019t have to go through years of trial and error.\nBuild an audience with writing \u2013 don\u2019t waste time on video editing and graphics yet. Use writing on social media and a newsletter to build an audience. If you need an example of this, just look at my Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.\nUse a new client model \u2013 create a program, tutorials, or curriculum and take on more clients in a group coaching setting. This brings your client work down to 1-2 hours a week.\nEvolve your fulfillment \u2013 decrease pricing a bit, remove time-suckers like 1 on 1 calls, introduce a group chat or community, and attempt to restructure how you deliver to your clients without removing any value.\nNow, thanks to Koe\u2019s Law, you\u2019ve increased your earning potential from $100K per year to $300-$500K while working the same 4 hours.\nStage 3) Productize With Your Audience Growth\nDistribution = freedom.\nAudience = distribution.\nYou can turn your client work into a digital product at any time for extra income (and potentially more clients that needed to learn more before hiring you), but that won\u2019t be your main source of income at first.\nIn this third stage, you:\nCreate a cohort-based program \u2013 you charge less, restructure time-consuming aspects of your work, and take on more customers. Thanks to your larger audience, you earn more than a group client model while working the same amount of time.\nBuild a standalone digital product \u2013 use your teachings and results from your client work to build a successful product. You build it once and it sells while you sleep, adding to your income.\nLeave client work if you want \u2013 you may see a dip in income at the start, but that newly allotted time is used to diversify platforms, increase revenue, and improve audience growth speed.\nAgain, thanks to Koe\u2019s Law, you\u2019ve increased your earning potential from $300K per year to $1 million+ per year.\nThis is where rapid iteration comes into play. You must detach from manual labor and solely bank on your creative ability.\nYour time is allocated to:\n1-2 hours per week fulfilling your cohort program\n2 hours per day writing content to fuel growth\n1-2 hours a day building projects that take you even further\nYou can build new products, branch out of the one-person business, or just enjoy life for a bit until early retirement bores you enough to start meaningful building again.\nYou\u2019ve built so much leverage and distribution that you can sell whatever you want.\nHire a team to build software.\nWork with a product developer to launch a physical product.\nWrite a book to solidify your legacy in the space.\nThen do it all over again because money is a tool to build what you want but doesn\u2019t exist. Ignore anyone who tells you you don\u2019t need to make more.\nMoney is energy, and we will discuss that more in the next letter.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "Block out 1 hour a day.\nWork on 1 meaningful project.\nAim for 1 vision for your future.\nTake it 1 day at a time.\nYou don\u2019t need more motivation, you need more clarity.\nYou don\u2019t need more time, you need more focus.\nThis letter will teach you to unlock insane focus on command.\nMost people think they need to work like a millionaire to achieve their goals.\nBut most people don\u2019t understand how most millionaires work.\nTwo examples:\nThe first, Sam Altman from OpenAI\nSecond, Tej Dosa. A low-key copywriter who writes great X content:\nThird, myself.\nSo no, you don\u2019t need any more time than you already have.\nEveryone starts somewhere. People don\u2019t start with a fake millionaire routine. They start with what they have.\nAside from building new projects, I\u2019ve rarely worked more than 4 hours a day.\nEspecially when I was starting out and had other responsibilities.\nI had 1-2 hours a day and a bit more on my days off.\nThe entrepreneurs who work more make that choice, often at their own psychological expense.\nProductivity is like fitness and you wouldn\u2019t train 8 hours a day with no food or sleep and expect to make progress.\nThere are 2 types of work:\nBuilding \u2013 when you are building the foundation of something new. Like a product, service, or brand. This requires a lot of upfront work.\nMaintenance \u2013 when you are fueling the foundation you\u2019ve built with a streamline productivity system. Like writing content, marketing yourself, building an audience, or fulfilling on your product or service. This requires 1-4 hours a day depending on your skill level or choice of work.\nPeople trying to change their life or quit their job often get discouraged at the amount of work it takes to build.\nThey can\u2019t zoom out and realize that once it\u2019s built, your work decreases drastically.\nFocus compounds.\nYou become better at what you do with time.\nLike learning to walk, it\u2019s difficult at first. It takes more time to walk from where you are to where you want to be.\nBut as you try, fail, and let your self-corrective mind rewire new neural pathways you can walk there as fast as you want\u2026 or just sprint.\nIf you want my complete philosophy for focused living, grab my book The Art Of Focus.\nFocused work is only one part of changing your life.\nYour Mind Is A Supercomputer Running The Game Of Life\nYour mind is a supercomputer.\nYour attention is the RAM.\nThoughts, regrets, and tasks are the programs slowing your performance.\nWriting, mindfulness, and focus are the reboot you can access at any time.\nRAM \u2014 or \u201crandom access memory\u201d \u2014 is one of the most important parts of a computer, it determines performance.\nThe more RAM you use up with different programs running, open browser tabs, and the performance requirements of what you have running, the slower your performance will be.\nThis is no different from your focus, what you hold in your conscious attention.\nHumans can process 50 bits of information per second. That adds up to 125 billion bits of information in your lifetime.\nMost people live with multiple high-demand programs running that are draining the limited creative energy they have.\nThoughts about regretful past mistakes\nThoughts about stressful future happenings\nDesires of hunger and entertainment to escape those thoughts\nAn internal cry to break out of their conditioned way of living\nA list of mixed-priority tasks that need to be finished\nOpen loops of tasks they were supposed to complete but forgot about\nThe list goes on and on.\nThe modern mind has its attention split in infinite directions by default.\nWe go about our lives stressed and near sickness. Rather than living in the present with singular focus and a worry-free mind, we are the opposite. Living in a false reality created by split attention.\nWhen we hold too much of the past or future in the contents of our consciousness, chaos ensues. The mind tends toward disorder. If not kept in check, we lose the sense of control over our lives that leads to enjoyment. This is accomplished through controlled consciousness.\nPsychic Entropy: The Danger Of Distractions\nEntropy is the supreme law of the Universe.\nWithout getting too complicated, if you don\u2019t attempt to maintain order in a system by putting energy into solving problems, that system will decline into chaos.\nIf you don\u2019t put effort into maintaining your bookshelf, books will end up all over your house, at your friend\u2019s house, and small-scale chaos will ensue.\nIf you don\u2019t put effort into the system of cleaning your room, it will slowly get dirtier and dirtier until you live in a disgusting nest of filth.\nThis is the state of most people\u2019s minds.\nA disgusting nest of filth.\nPsychic entropy is the natural process of your psyche (or mind) tending toward chaos and disorder.\nYou aren\u2019t productive because you don\u2019t have clarity.\nYou aren\u2019t productive because you focus on one distraction, don\u2019t correct yourself, and slowly become overwhelmed by the chaos in your mind.\nDistractions are the problems in your productivity system that must be solved if you want to unlock laser focus.\nThere are 2 ways to identify distractions and correct yourself:\nBoredom and anxiety.\nIf the challenge of the task you are completing is too low for your skill level, you will get bored.\nIf the challenge of the task you are completing is too high for your skill level, you will get anxious.\nThe boredom stems from self-centeredness.\nYour focus breaks, a new desire pops into your head, and related thoughts start to fill your attention.\nIf you are bored of the task, you will start thinking of better things you could be doing.\nThe anxiety stems from self-consciousness.\nYour focus turns inward and negative thoughts flood your mind about how you aren\u2019t good enough.\nIf you look in the mirror and spot a pimple, that is going to be on your mind for the rest of the day. It will impact every other area of your life.\nThe RAM of your mental supercomputer will be consumed by rogue programs until your performance suffers as a whole.\nThe chaos induced by boredom or anxiety can only be cured with clarity.\nYou must refocus your mind not only on the task in front of you, but on the ideal outcome of your life as a whole.\nWhen you have the skill and knowledge that matches the challenge of a task, life becomes a video game of quests that you love to play.\nThe 4-Hour Workday \u2013 Creating Your Productivity System\nHumans find meaning in stories.\nHumans love playing games.\nWhy?\nBecause they present a clear hierarchy of goals that our mind can adopt as an indistractable frame.\nThey follow the curiosity > intensity > consistency cycle of the Universe.\nFirst you\u2019re lost. Then you\u2019re curious. Then you\u2019re obsessed. Then it\u2019s a consistent part of your life with little extra effort.\nMost people get lost, focus on distractions, and never put effort into a goal (even if they don\u2019t see the meaning in it yet) to reverse the hole they\u2019re digging themselves into.\nUnderstand that nothing is perfect.\nLike a story, you will experience lows, but those are what allow the highs to exist. Success doesn\u2019t exist without failure.\nLike a video game, you will have to progress from beginner to advanced by completing a series of quests to level up. It will take time.\nIf you want maximum enjoyment and focus in your work, these guidelines will help you create a hierarchy of goals for your productivity system.\nThe longer you stick with it, the more potent it becomes.\nIdentity \u2013 Solving Productive Problems\nEver since I can remember, I\u2019ve always had the goal of working 4 hours a day.\nA 9-5 job was the bane of my existence.\nI observed society and realized the life I didn\u2019t want\nI observed the successful and realized the life I did want\nOver time, this perspective shaped my identity.\nI was attached to that desire.\nMost people tell you desire is bad, but in my eyes, it\u2019s only bad if the desire is bad.\nYour goals are the axis of your suffering, and you get to choose what you suffer for.\nPerspective is everything.\nIt allows you to identify problems and opportunities that (when solved) result in achieving the goal of that perspective.\nIt was an automatic decision to get to where I am today.\nAnything that threatened my 4-hour workday was noted as a problem.\nI was able to spot opportunities like social media, digital products, and audience building to solve those problems.\nMost people have an identity and perspective shaped by society, with the goals of society, so they never identify and solve problems that lead to abnormal results.\nProject \u2013 Building Out Your Potential\nYour identity is shaped by your vision for the future.\nYour vision is the all-encompassing goal you are pursuing in your life. It is at the top of your hierarchy. Everything falls under it.\nNow, you need a project that will move the needle toward that future.\nYou need something to build that will expose you to problems you must solve.\nYou need clarity for your work so you have something to anchor your attention.\nAnd if you read the last letter, you understand that building a project is the best way to learn new knowledge and skills.\nCreate an outline \u2013 braindump everything you know that should be built in the project. You will add to this outline as you build.\nCreate milestones \u2013 break the project down into manageable goals you can achieve in 1-4 hour work sessions depending on your current responsibilities.\nWhat should your project be?\nI can\u2019t tell you that.\nBut it should probably be a business as that\u2019s the vessel for your purpose. It is the catalyst for the good life that breaks you out of robotic living. Entrepreneurship is modern survival, and your psyche is wired to hunt. You aren\u2019t meant to be a monkey in a cubicle.\nAlong with that, your health and relationships are important projects that enhance your business results.\nDeadlines \u2013 The Procrastinators Edge\nYou aren\u2019t productive because you aren\u2019t public.\nAnother point for building an internet business on social media. The flow-state requirement of challenges and deadlines is baked in.\nWhen I set a launch date for a product and accept pre-orders, once the first person pays, I have to build the product before the deadline.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how good or bad it is.\nI can improve it after the fact that it\u2019s actually out and I did something with my life.\nAnother thing:\nProcrastination isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s human nature.\nMost successful entrepreneurs are lazy.\nThey wait until the last minute to get work done.\nBut during that last minute, they enter the most enjoyable season of their lives. Their mind becomes a magnet for ideas. Their best work happens in these periods of obsession and intensity.\nThey don\u2019t have a choice, their survival is at stake.\nTimeblocks & Breaks \u2013 Managing Your Focus\nFocus is a muscle, and success is reserved for those who train it. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nIdentity, projects, and deadlines narrow your attention.\nTimeblocks take that one step further, making it easy to get into flow.\nSet a timer for 45-90 minutes.\nFocus with intensity.\nThen, take a break.\nGo on a walk. Eat. Watch some YouTube. Play a video game. I don\u2019t care what you do.\nYour focus is finite. You need to take rest between your sets.\nPersonally, I write for two 60 minute time blocks. That is what builds my entire business.\nLeverage \u2013 Doing The Right Things\nI\u2019m going to save you a lot of pain:\nChoose a career that allows for a 4-hour workday.\nStart a one-person business. Become a value creator. Use the internet to do what you love.\nLearn the skills that allow for this.\nEvolution is the process of solving problems that reverse entropy.\nLabor work and long work days are a massive problem. People hate it. So, social media, the internet, and artificial intelligence were born.\nAI will solve the problem of overwork. Potentially in this lifetime (especially if we solve the problem of aging).\nNow, your work sessions for the day should consist of 3-9 lever-moving tasks that build out your project.\nSome people can handle more, some less. I help you structure this in the FOCI planner.\nRoutine \u2013 Becoming Efficient\nYou have a routine.\nEven if your routine is \u201cno routine.\u201d\nWe discuss this in The Daily Routine That Changed My Life.\nRoutines are how you condition your mind to run on new systems.\nIf you want to solidify a new identity, you must start, refine, and stick to a routine.\nFor the first month, building your project will feel uncomfortable.\nYou\u2019re supposed to feel overwhelmed. It means your mind is expanding into a new identity.\nSlowly, then all at once, everything flows with ease.\nYou begin making exponential progress.\nYou move from intensity to consistency and let the results compound.\nRest \u2013 The Secret Of The Greats\n\u201cThe clever man may work smarter, not harder, they say, but the creative man doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d \u2014 Alex Soojung-Kim Pang\nI\u2019ve always had some form of aversion toward Western work culture.\n80-hour work weeks.\nHigh-pressure environments.\nLittle time for rest and recovery.\nIt never seemed \u201cright\u201d to me.\nWhy would I want to waste my entire day, knowing that 2-3 hours in my work quality would suffer?\nThis has been a talking point for a long time now. I believe it has started to shape the creator economy and remote work.\nAncient Romans, Ancient Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an infinite list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attributed their success to surprisingly low \u201cwork\u201d times.\nWriters from multiple domains, like Hemingway and Tarantino, would spend the majority of their days lounging by the pool, spitting game with girls, and doing everything aside from what they deemed \u201cwork.\u201d\nWork for 1-4 hours.\nThen, stop.\nThis is arguably the most difficult part of your day.\nAt the end of my work sessions I go to the gym as a \u201ctransition\u201d into rest.\nThis allows the Default Mode Network to kick in. My subconscious begins to munch on problems related to the work.\nWhen I get back to my morning focused work, I have the rest and creative resources needed to make those 4 hours more potent than those fatiguing their mental muscle beyond belief.\nI hope you enjoyed this letter my friends.\nDan"

You\u2019ve built the mental muscle to lift the emotional labor that comes with doing those things.\nThe difference between then and now is the limits you\u2019ve adopted as a part of your identity.\nYour aged mind, when not kept in check with mindfulness, will cower at the first hint of discomfort.\nAnd when you listen and obey the mind that doesn\u2019t want what\u2019s best for you, that becomes your default state. You become a robot self-programmed to avoid any pain, even when that pain is what brings meaning, fulfillment, and purpose to your life.\nLive At The Edge Of Your Abilities\nIf you consume too much and create too little, your mind gets fat.\nIf you create too much and consume too little, your mind gets skinny.\nWe want neither.\nWhen the flow of information is maximized in your life through the balance of consumption and creation, you will encounter meaningful events.\nYou will feel a deep sense of excitement for the future, fulfillment in the present, and gratitude for the past.\nThese feelings should be seen as an opportunity to document the important parts of your life that you can share with others.\nWhen you read a good book and stumble across a lesson that sparks excitement, write it down.\nWhen you feel fulfilled in the present because of the progress you are making, write it down.\nWhen you feel grateful that your past has led you to this moment, despite your mistakes, write it down (in something like Kortex).\nAs your notes of signal grow, you have data from which you can replicate those experiences.\nYou can condition your mind to occupy these states of consciousness as a baseline.\nYour quality of life increases to a point of high stability.\nUniversal Thinking \u2013 The Solution To Most Of Your Problems\nYou feel bad because your future self is watching your every move, and they don\u2019t like what they see.\nThe solution to most of your problems:\nZoom out. Adopt the perspective of your ideal self. Break out of the narrow focus that traps you in a chaotic loop of negative thoughts.\nUnderstand where you are, choose where you want to be, and bridge the gap with education & execution.\nMost people live in a state of closed-mindedness.\nThey fall victim to the anxiety, overwhelm, and stress that prevents them from seeing beyond their problems (so they can solve them).\nPeople focus on the bad lyric instead of the good song.\nPeople focus on the ugly pixel instead of the beautiful image.\nYou are missing the context of the situation and misinterpreting it, so you remain stuck and unable to learn.\nYou must train your ability to zoom out, adopt a higher perspective, and perceive situations as advantageous toward your end goal.\nForm this habit:\nWhen you sense overwhelm, pause and break the reaction cycle.\nMove up the perspective ladder by opening your mind:\n1) Your current perspective \u2013 take inventory of your current situation.\n2) The perspective of your ideal self \u2013 what would the highest version of yourself do?\n3) The perspective of the Universe \u2013 beyond all limits, most of our worries are irrational and meaningless from the highest perspective.\nThese 3 stages are represented by the FOCI symbol on my book, The Art of Focus.\nWhen you zoom out far enough, only then can you discover potentials, connections, directions, and creative ideas that allow you to learn more than what you know.\nUniversal Thinking is the state of mind from which you can note patterns and understand topics from the big picture.\nOne can note the vast similarities between bodybuilding, mindbuilding, and businessbuilding \u2013 like progressive overload, time under tension, and proper nutrition \u2013 enhancing the results from each.\nOn a Universal level, you can note the birth and death of muscle, ideas, and products \u2013 helping you live at peace with the flow of your body, mind, and business \u2013 or make a decision that leads to exponential growth.\nHow To Learn 10x Faster\nWhen you learn how to learn, you can achieve 5 years of results in 6 months.\nLet\u2019s take everything we\u2019ve learned above and ground it with practical steps.\n1) Create A Clarity Catalyst\nThere were a few moments in my life when I made giant leaps in learning, understanding, and progress:\nWriting my book\nBuilding my products\nWriting these newsletters\nWhat do they all have in common?\nI treat them as a project.\nA project has:\nAn outline so you can note ideas to fill in that outline from everyday life.\nMilestones so you have direction and clarity on your next steps.\nA real-world deadline that forces you to act, or else your survival takes a hit.\nExperimentation, trial, and error so you can turn failures into lessons.\nThis presents a perfect environment for the flow state.\nThere is pattern recognition for novelty and dopamine, clarity from milestones, challenge from deadlines, and feedback from reality.\nDetermine what you want to learn.\nCreate a real-world project that you will publish for others to see.\nIf you don\u2019t know what project to create, see what others have done.\nIf you want to learn Photoshop, your project will be anything from a graphic to a digital art scene.\nIf you want to learn how to bodybuild, your project is your body, nutrition regimen, and training program.\nYour project outline doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. It can start as a jumbled list of ideas on what you think you have to do and learn.\nA project is an experience anchor.\nYou now have somewhere to write ideas, knowledge, and techniques down to try.\nWhen I wrote my book, my book outline made life meaningful. Almost every idea I came across could be added to the outline.\nI felt like a child again. I became obsessed.\nEverything was seen from a new lens. The lens of my project.\n2) Learn As You Build\nIf you aren\u2019t building, you aren\u2019t learning.\nIf you aren\u2019t actively applying what you learn to a problem sitting in your mind, you are simply stacking useless knowledge as soon-to-be-forgotten brain fog.\nWhen you start building something, there are only a few things you need to know: the fundamentals.\nYou have no business researching advanced tactics yet.\nThe fundamentals will take you 80% of the way there (and for most people, that\u2019s millions of dollars, a jacked physique, or a stress-free life).\nNew tactics will take you the next 20% of the way, but this mental bandwidth should be reserved for obsession, mastery, and your life\u2019s work of a few specific skills and interests.\nWhen you have a project to build, do one or both of the following:\nPurchase a beginner-level course on the topic\nWatch overview videos on YouTube that teach the fundamentals\nStudy them until you have clarity on what to do next. Then, do it, and when you encounter a problem:\nRefer back to sections of the course or video\nResearch how to solve that problem directly\nWatch tutorials where people build projects similar to yours and see how they overcome those problems\nLearning is problem-solving, not hoarding as much knowledge as you can.\n3) Teach What You Learn\nI, of course, recommend teaching in public by writing as a personal brand (or your public resume) so you can also attract high-paying opportunities as you learn. (This is what I teach in 2 Hour Writer).\nWrite in public and let people criticize you.\nTeach your friends to make for interesting conversations.\nTake notes on the subject but write them as if you were teaching yourself.\nTeaching almost forces you to make sense of the information.\nYou have to structure it, explain it, and ensure that you aren\u2019t giving false knowledge.\nWhen I write these newsletters, I don\u2019t know everything. But I can guarantee that writing for 4 years has accelerated my learning in the topics I love well beyond what I would\u2019ve learned trapped in tutorial hell.\nWhen you build a brand (not in the business sense, in the sense of your external display to the world), building and teaching collapse into your work.\nYour life becomes a meaningful series of solving problems, learning how to solve them, teaching others, and making an income doing so. I believe this is what evolution has allowed: people doing what they love without barriers thanks to the internet.\nOn imposter syndrome:\nSimple \u2013 be honest.\nDon\u2019t fabricate your experience. Don\u2019t lie about what you know. Teach from the lens you learned it.\nSomething as simple and attention-grabbing as, \u201cI read The Art of Focus in 23 hours, here are the life-changing lessons I learned on joining the new rich,\u201d is honest to where you are in your learning journey.\nSimilar to marketing a product, simply don\u2019t promise results you don\u2019t have.\n4) Expand Into A New Level Of Mind\nBy this point, you may still feel overwhelmed or like you aren\u2019t learning much.\nThis is a good thing.\nYour mind is primed for pattern recognition.\nSo:\nLaunch yourself into the unknown \u2013 immerse yourself in the culture, environment, and information related to what you are trying to learn.\nCondition your mind through repetition and exposure \u2013 slowly understand the lingo, vocabulary, and skill set of those who have seen success in that topic.\nLet your mind expand through the discomfort \u2013 the worst thing you can do is quit when you are feeling growing pains.\nYou aren\u2019t seeing results because you aren\u2019t the person who would see results.\nThis process allows you to become a new person by letting your old version die.\nLike when you are adopting new habits, you have to get out of the old environment that fueled your bad habits.\nTo make this more practical:\nRead books \u2013 books give you 10 years of effort from 6 hours of reading.\nConsume lectures \u2013 long articles and videos give you 3 days of effort in 20 minutes.\nFollow new people \u2013 this is less about consuming short-form content and more about training your mind to be in that tribe of people.\nBuy 3 books.\nOne best-seller, one technical, and one historical.\nBurn through them and don\u2019t let your obsession die.\nThis may seem like a long process, but we aren\u2019t trying to learn something on a surface level, we are trying to become masters as fast as possible.\n5) Make Connections To Solidify Understanding\nWhen you master one thing, it becomes easier to master others.\nPrinciples are Universal. They overlap.\nWhen you master fitness, you can master business in half the time, and then relationships in another half.\nMost people never master one domain of their lives, so they never experience exponential personal growth.\nWhen you feel like you have a solid understanding of the topic you are trying to learn:\nZoom out one layer \u2013 move from \u201cPhotoshop\u201d to \u201cgraphic design\u201d to \u201ccreative work.\u201d\nTake note of signal \u2013 when your mind signals important information, write it down.\nBuild better projects \u2013 from a new level of mind, build a new project that will take you to the success you want to see.\nIn my own experience, my knowledge compounded when I peeled back a layer from web design to marketing to content creation to metaphysics.\nThis is also a great way to start your one-person business.\nStart by learning, teaching, and building in one domain then branch out as your audience expands.\nWe help you do this and start your digital career in 90 days inside Kortex University.\nNow, go learn, build, and enjoy your weekend.\nDan"

        "content": "Your mind is a complex set of systems that becomes more efficient in achieving the goals it adopts with time.\nYour mind is the vessel that interprets reality.\nWhen you were born, your mind was almost a blank slate.\nYou had biological goals of survival, so your mind would fire the synapses to cry when you were hungry, when you wanted attention, and when you felt discomfort after letting one loose in your diaper. Most babies come out of the womb crying because they just entered a massively stimulating and unknown game called life.\nAs you aged, you started developing a kinesthetic version of yourself.\nEven when you couldn\u2019t see your own face, your parents would sing nursery rhymes and point to their body parts to help you understand yourself.\n\u201cEyes, ears, mouth, and nose.\u201d\nSoon after, you began to crawl, play with toys from your culture, walk, and try to make sense of this foreign language your parents were speaking.\nYou wanted to survive. You wanted to fit in. Your mind was a pattern recognition machine. And the systems of behavior and language were programmed into your mind as you subconsciously tested, failed, and succeeded with society\u2019s code.\nA system is a process to achieve a goal, and the societal system was injected in your mind so you didn\u2019t lose your mind since you were a child.\nI discuss all of this in my newly released book, The Art of Focus.\nFrom Asleep To Awake\nBy the time we reach 30, the average person is in a prison of their own creation.\nNot society\u2019s creation, their own.\nIt was you who failed to question the limits that society projected on you.\nYou accepted them without struggle.\nMost people grow to live the same monotonous life, over and over again, reinforcing their narrow minds with excuses, justifications, and identifications.\nGet offended. Blame everyone but yourself. Tie your self-worth to radical ideologies. Accept everything at face value and question nothing. Expect free handouts for simply existing, no effort. Do what the authorities tell you. Go to school, get a job, retire at the ripe age of whatever it may be, no guarantees, with just the right amount of currency to survive until death. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nThere is a turning point in every young adult\u2019s life.\nYou can either remain a slave to the code written in your head, or you can go through the painful experience of learning it, deconstructing it, and reprogramming it.\n3 broad stages of moral development are generally agreed upon:\nPre-conventional \u2013 a young human that has not yet socialized, they avoid punishment through obedience and act out of self-interest.\nConventional \u2013 the human learns from itself and others forming beliefs, values, and standards by conforming to society. They attempt to maintain social order.\nPost-conventional \u2013 the human questions and reflects on society, observes it from a higher level, and can then criticize or reform it with critical thought. Universal principles come into play, resulting in the \u201cAh! Buddhists were right!\u201d insight.\nThe danger is getting trapped in prior stages.\nPeople attach to ideologies in these stages and preach that worldview as \u201cright\u201d while others are \u201cwrong.\u201d\nYou can see this in bible thumpers cowering to their fantastical God to avoid punishment.\nYou can also see this in businesspeople who believe one model or way of doing things is absolute.\nAnd to break philosophical character a bit \u2013 those who reach the post-conventional stage of creator development make the realization that You are the niche and operate their business from Universal principles.\nThis letter will serve as a catalyst to wake a few curious people up.\nThe Matrix Is A Web Of Ideas\nCulture is a mass hallucination, and when you step outside the mass hallucination you see it for what it\u2019s worth. \u2013 Terrence McKenna\nHow do you know anything about reality?\nHow do you know what\u2019s true or what\u2019s false?\nHow do you know what you should or shouldn\u2019t do?\nYou were told by another person in society who learned in society.\n99% of what you know was not discovered by your own testing or experimentation.\nWhere did other people get their information? Other people.\nEvery piece of information you get is from other people who knew nothing when they were born.\nAfter you learn to walk and talk, the next step you take as a child is to go to school, so let\u2019s use that as an example.\nSchool boards determine what should be taught in school. But parents heavily influence the school board. Where do parents get the notion of what should or shouldn\u2019t be taught in school? From their schooling and parents.\nAs you progress through public school, you pick up habits, refine your behavior, and develop your language from other students and teachers. Where do students and teachers learn their habits, behavior, and language?\nBy now, you\u2019re nearly a clone going into the formal education system.\nLet\u2019s run through this a bit quicker\u2026\nThe students and educators in the universities are coming from the schools. The people who teach children in the schools come from the universities. The people who taught the people who teach in universities also come from universities. Can you see how this is groundless and circular?\nSociety determines information as true from scientific journals and publications. To be published, you must conform to the bias of the publication. Who created the publications? People whose bias was shaped through their PhD education, taught by someone with a PhD education.\nWhile you are at school, how do you complete your assignments? You research sites like Wikipedia when the articles are coming from the universities. You find the Wikipedia page through a search engine like Google.\nGoogle determines what is displayed based on what\u2019s most profitable or popular to serve up. Google gives authority to pages based on linking and link authority. Google places more authority on links coming from universities.\nThe school system is only one example of this.\nPharma companies fund huge wings of universities.\nThe banking system is the lubrication between each anchor in society.\nYou have to take out student loans to finance your education.\nMoney is the lifeblood of the matrix, and if money stops flowing to any given area, it dies off like if you were to lose blood to your hand.\nThe structure of society relies on itself to exist.\nSome could call this a pyramid scheme.\nAttention Anchors \u2013 Negative Feedback Conditions Your Mind\nYou can live and die inside these intellectual structures if you choose to. But people of curiosity\u2026 usually find themselves unsatisfied with the conventional answers. \u2013 Terrence McKenna\nSociety is a web of ideas that allows your mind to make sense of the world and not go insane.\nIdeas, in this sense, are anything that the mind can make sense of and label. Ideas are everything. And if we want to get a bit crazy, everything is an idea in the mind of reality. Reality is mental.\nIdeas are whole parts. They layer on top of each other. They allow each other to exist. They are hierarchical.\nLike a word to a sentence to a paragraph to a chapter to a book, and that book is also a whole part of a bookcase, and that bookcase is broken down into parts like wood, which came from a tree, and a tree connects deep into the ecosystem allowing for much else to exist.\nThis societal web contains anchors like schooling, the media, the economy, the government, and culture that were all made up by those residing in it.\nSociety is a feedback system that punishes people for not fitting in as the negative feedback mechanism to correct behavior for the goals of society.\nParents scold their children when they don\u2019t follow the rules of the matrix.\nTeachers give bad grades to encourage memorization and obedience.\nPeers make fun of you when you do something out of the norm.\nSociety is a system.\nYour mind is a system.\nYour identity is a system.\nFrom macro to micro, reality is a complex nest \u2013 or hierarchy \u2013 of systems. Reality is a giant mind.\nFrom the bottom up, your identity is programmed and shaped by society unless you make the conscious choice to reprogram it.\nProgramming is similar to conditioning or training.\nWith time and repetition, you pick up habits, learn your language, and form a worldview that may or may not align with your ideal lifestyle. Systems are layered in your mind as a deeply interconnected mesh with society.\nIt all starts with attention.\nYour mind craves order, security, and certainty. Society provides that. So your attention is nearly forced to focus on the system society has laid out for you.\nYour identity houses the conscious or unconscious goals you are trying to achieve.\nIf you are a program running in society, an NPC, and you have the goal to get a high-paying job, your mind won\u2019t register starting a business as important.\nThis seems harmless on the surface, because \u201cnot everyone needs to start a business,\u201d but it goes much deeper than that.\nDeconstructing The Game\nGames are fun to play, but only for a bit.\nIf you do not continue pursuing the challenge it takes to level up, it becomes boring.\nIf you try to play a new game but don\u2019t start at level one, you get anxious and quit.\nA game is a system. A game is a story. A mimics the ebbs and flows of reality.\nThe mind loves games because the mind loves order. It loves when things make sense, and hates when they don\u2019t.\nA game contains a hierarchy of goals that orders the mind and results in focus, flow, and fulfillment \u2013 but only as long as you are progressing through the game.\nSociety is a game with the goals from the bottom up of:\nGo to school so you can get on the same invisible page as everyone else\nGet a job so you can contribute to the operations of society\nMarry someone according to a made-up cultural moral code\nBecome chained down with responsibilities you don\u2019t care about (because society told you to)\nBe forced to focus on menial problems so you waste your time and never threaten society by pursuing your own thing and thinking freely\nRetire at whatever age you can with a bit of money just like it was planned all along\nHope to never work again and be on eternal vacation (we all know how that turns out)\nLife is somewhat engaging in school, but when you reach the job quest of the societal game, boredom slowly grasps at your sanity and makes you a pleasure-seeking robot.\nThis is the outcome for 99% of people.\nIf you don\u2019t create your own game, you get trapped playing someone else\u2019s, and that gets boring\u2026 sending you into an eternal cycle of stress and narrow-mindedness.\nHow To Escape The Matrix\nI am not writing this intending to paint society as evil.\nIt was mostly an unconscious process of survival.\nIt is a necessary game we have to play until more people wake up to create a more conscious game for children to play, which may take decades if not centuries.\nHowever, for those reading this, there are general steps you can take to escape this matrix.\nThis is not a quick fix.\nThis is a lifestyle.\nThis is your life\u2019s work:\nTo see what you are capable of.\n1) Master Your Survival & Find Purpose\nYour problems are a tight-knit web that bind you to your current situation. Problems don\u2019t exist on their own. \u2013 The Art of Focus\nThere is a reason you are in a life situation you don\u2019t like.\nYou have failed to gain awareness of the problems keeping you there.\nYou haven\u2019t expanded your mind to see beyond your problems, acquire what is necessary to solve them (knowledge and skill), and solved them to solidify that new level of mind.\nYou feel lost because you don\u2019t have a purpose.\nFor simplicity, your purpose is the problem you are solving to achieve a goal. Most people are assigned a purpose that doesn\u2019t evolve, and they are forever stuck in a narrow-minded state of stress pushing toward the goals of society.\nWhen you master your survival, you no longer have to worry constantly.\nYou open up room for creativity, spirituality, and meaningful work.\nYou don\u2019t care about these things because you can\u2019t care about them.\nYou haven\u2019t solved the problems staring you in the face.\nAre you overweight? Is your diet terrible? Do you hate your job? Are you ignoring your relationships?\nThese are interconnected problems, not singular.\nYour job may be consuming so much time in your day that you don\u2019t have the energy to put effort into other areas of your life. Your nutrition may be contributing to that lack of energy and spilling over into your relationships.\nMastering your survival is mastering the eternal markets: health, wealth, and relationships.\nThere\u2019s no coincidence these are the most profitable verticals in business. Everyone has these problems, and by solving them, you gain the experience to monetize your experience and do what you love.\nI discuss this in Solve Your Own Problems & Sell The Solution.\nWhen you fulfill minor purposes of self-improvement, only then can you discover deeper, more meaningful purposes.\nStop trying to solve the problems of the world when you haven\u2019t even solved your own.\n2) Learn From The Decentralized School System\nYou aren\u2019t aware of your potential because you haven\u2019t been exposed to it.\nYou haven\u2019t been exposed to it because your environment is completely known.\nThe unknown is the land of possibility.\nYou must expose yourself to new career paths, health paradigms, and social circles.\nRealize the knowledge and skills you must acquire to change your life. Writing, marketing, sales, fitness, nutrition, communication, and the rest.\nA good starting point is 2 Hour Writer, as writing is the foundation of any other skill you learn.\nWhen you do, you will feel uncomfortable. Your identity will be threatened. It will take time to accumulate.\nThe creator economy is the decentralized school system.\nCreators are solving their own problems, forging new paths, creating new jobs, and teaching what they learn through content.\nBreak out of your bubble of comfort\nFollow new people distributing life-changing information\nInvest in non-traditional education for non-traditional results\nDiscover new potentials for your life and act on them\nLife becomes meaningful at the edge of the known.\nWhen you discover novel information, your brain will signal that you\u2019ve encountered a meaningful event.\nDon\u2019t ignore this.\nPursue it fully.\nObsess over the rabbit whole of education.\nThis is how you open your mind, order your mind, and train your mind to become a new mind \u2013 one that isn\u2019t subject to the limits of society.\nCreate Your Own Infinite Game\nEntrepreneurship is the only logical option for long-term thinkers. \u2013 The Art of Focus\nIf you want to stop playing society\u2019s game, you must create your own.\nOne with infinite progression and evolution.\nNot one that traps you at a certain level and makes life boring.\nThis is done through cultivating a vision for your future, iterating on a plan to create that reality, and choosing a vessel that allows you to do that.\nNote that I said \u201ccultivate\u201d a vision and \u201citerate\u201d on a plan.\nThis is an ongoing process. It doesn\u2019t end. Your vision will not remain static. Nor will your plan. As is the same with all things in life, they change.\nIllustrate everything you want in your future\nIllustrate everything you don\u2019t want in your future\nCreate a hierarchy of goals to get there\nAcquire the knowledge and skills necessary\nMake changes to your plan with experience as a feedback mechanism\nYou can do this in a blank notebook, or use the FOCI Planner I created for this exact process.\nWhen you get bored, don\u2019t quit, pivot. Pursue a higher challenge that utilizes the skills you\u2019ve acquired.\nFor example: if you get bored with freelancing, try e-commerce. This is not shiny object syndrome, this is intelligence.\nWhen you get anxious, set a more clear goal between you and the overwhelming goal you are trying to achieve.\nLeverage The Digital Society\nI see jobs as a stepping stone, not a death sentence (although for many it is).\nFor most people, it isn\u2019t feasible to go straight into entrepreneurship.\nBy nature of the matrix, people take on responsibilities that tie them down early in life.\nBills, a family, a house, and a job that can drain your energy to do anything about it.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I am not anti-job.\nJobs are extremely useful for cultivating a valuable skill set, but the fulfilling challenge they provide can fade fast, and if work consumes 1/3 of your life, but drains your energy for the other 1/3, and you are asleep for the other 1/3\u2026 that is the first thing that needs to change.\nThe internet and social media have created a digital society.\nCreators and brands are the new education system, media, government (of the online space\u2026 people calling each other out and whatnot to keep the space clean), religion (everyone is pushing an ideology), and economy (everyone is selling something\u2026 and no, this isn\u2019t a bad thing, it\u2019s survival).\nThis society is decentralized. You aren\u2019t forced into any one path. You have the option to pursue what you want, and you are responsible for your lack of critical thought if you get trapped in place.\nMy advice:\nUse your skill set to get a job under a creator or brand on the internet\nChoose one that allows you free time to pursue your own thing\nUse the new skills you learn to build your own thing\nYour profile is your public resume.\nWe teach all of this to help you start your digital career in 90 days in Kortex University.\nYou write content to display your value. You network to join a community. You leverage that community for opportunities. And you eventually use the resources you gain, like an audience, to build your own business and live free.\nYou won\u2019t be able to do this in an instant, just like it took 18+ years for you to become a line of code in society.\nDeconstruct the game you are playing.\nUnderstand the code running in your mind.\nCreate your own game.\nAnd enjoy the rest of your week.\nDan"

        "content": "Ever since I can remember, I\u2019ve had the goal of doing what I love for a living. Isn\u2019t that what everyone wants?\nMy family, teachers, and even the people I was following online screamed at me to go down other paths.\nSo that\u2019s what I did.\nWent to college (and didn\u2019t finish after 5 years)\nLearned creative skills on the side\nStarted every online business imaginable\nLearned to code because it was \u201clucrative\u201d\nDropped out of college because it was wasting my time\nGot a $55K/year job as an entry level web developer at a design agency\nThroughout this entire journey, my dream of \u201cdoing what I love\u201d stuck in the back of my head. I was constantly reminded of it. There wasn\u2019t a single moment from age 16-25 where I wasn\u2019t working on a meaningful side project.\nI still maintain this habit to this day. If it isn\u2019t a business project, it\u2019s a health project.\nThis is how I get out of a rut, because the only reason I fall into a rut is psychic entropy, the mind tending toward disorder. Meaning I don\u2019t have a goal, project, or priority to bring my focus to.\nMy current projects are Kortex (second brain software), Kortex University (a school for creators), promoting my book, planning another book (to write in Kortex), and gaining a few more pounds before I trim down for the warm seasons.\nWhy am I telling you all of this?\nBecause I realized most people didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\nI was taking career and life advice from people who hadn\u2019t achieved what I wanted to achieve. In their closed mind, the reality I wanted to create was impossible, yet I kept looping back to projects that I loved working on for the sake of maintaining my sanity.\nMost people don\u2019t have a personal project that will create the future they want.\nMost people don\u2019t realize a personal project is not optional to create the future they want.\nThe only other option is to live by your programming, pursue the goals that society set for you, and work on the projects that lead to those goals. If you don\u2019t spend 1 hour building your dreams, you will spend 8 hours building someone else\u2019s, for life.\n10 years ago, my mindset was: \u201cIf I can monetize any of these passion projects, I\u2019ll be set. All I need to do is learn and build until one works. I need to increase my capacity for luck with skill acquisition and experience. It may take 10 years, but some people go to school for 12. Even if I fail I\u2019d be in a similar position.\u201d\nAfter years of trial and error with every \u201cmarketable skill\u201d that people tell you to learn, I found the secret.\nWell, not really a secret, but I\u2019m supposed to make you curious to read more ya know.\nBefore we begin:\nThis one is going to be long. Make sure you have the bandwidth and time to read it. I promise it will be worth it.\nAside from that, another reminder that The Art of Focus (my book) is now available on Amazon in Kindle, audiobook, and paperback.\nWhy Writing?\nThe future of media is decentralized.\nPeople are and will continue to turn to:\nSocial media for news\nCourses for education\nCreators for knowledge\nI don\u2019t want to hear about AI disrupting writing.\nI see it as an impossibility that the only thing we consume online is created by a robot without a soul.\nThe emergence of AI seems to favor human creativity, and media is the vessel for front-end creativity.\nAI is a tool for writers to become more prolific.\nWriting is the skill that breathes life into any other skill you learn.\nIt is the meta-skill that people avoid learning until they are forced to (because they need to survive).\nThey don\u2019t see it\u2019s importance because it\u2019s \u201cjust plain old writing, who needs to learn that?\u201d\nThere was a reason I failed at almost every business model I tried.\nDigital art, SEO, Facebook ads, dropshipping, e-commerce stores, and more.\nI was so focused on learning the skill and building a website that I forgot I actually had to get customers at some point.\nHow do you get customers?\nWriting.\nContent (or media) is the front end of the internet. It\u2019s how you capture, hold, and convert attention in a sea of self-deprecating memes and valueless content.\nThe foundation of content is writing.\nTweets? Writing.\nThreads? Writing.\nNewsletters? Writing.\nBlog posts? Writing.\nCold emails? Writing.\nSocial media captions? Writing.\nLanding pages? Writing.\nProduct descriptions? Writing.\nCourse modules? Writing.\nClient communications? Writing.\nCustomer resources? Writing.\nAds of any form? Starts with writing.\nYouTube videos? Done best with written scripts.\nInstagram reels and TikToks? Like reading well-written tweets.\nImages on Instagram? Usually designed from a well-written quote or saying.\nAny other form of online marketing, advertising, or entertainment? Starts with writing.\nEverything that your audience, customers, and network see starts with writing.\nDon\u2019t underestimate that power.\nEvery single person in business is a writer at their core, they just don\u2019t label themselves as that.\nThere\u2019s a reason I can outperform every dude with six pack abs in terms of engagement and follower growth on Instagram.\nHigh-impact digital writing.\nNot technical or academic writing.\nI\u2019m not here to teach you how to write a research paper. I\u2019m here to teach you how to write in a way that lets you live the life you want.\nIf you want to become a master of content (and leverage no-code tools to distribute your writing and attract an audience) it\u2019s pretty clear that writing needs to be the foundation of your one-person business.\n6 Steps To Starting A One-Person Writing Business\nContent is an extension of the personal and collective mind. We put out our ideas, beliefs, and opinions that form a digital society, cultures, and world. Content on the internet is content in the collective consciousness.\nThe Art Of Focus\nI call myself a writer because that is what I do on a daily basis (even when it doesn\u2019t seem like it on social media).\nI\u2019ve sustained a $100K-$250K per month (with the occasional jump to $500K-$700K) revenue by writing tweets, newsletters, and threads that get repurposed into Instagram posts, YouTube videos, LinkedIn posts, and the rest. This is only for my personal brand, not my other company.\nIn reflection, and referring to the top of this letter, writing is the force multiplier that made me have to pay 20x my previous web design salary in taxes each year. That\u2019s a solid problem to have.\nBut, if you were to strip things down to only X and a Newsletter, I would still maintain a lot of that revenue.\nDon\u2019t fall into the trap that you have to have an insane follower count across all platforms to replace your current income. Follow this progression of income sources if you don\u2019t know where to start (last week\u2019s letter).\nGetting into it, here are the 6 steps to start your writing business.\n1) Choose A Topic You Can\u2019t Shutup About\nDon\u2019t overthink this just yet. Pick a topic and practice writing.\nIt can be productivity, creativity, spirituality, fitness, or any of the interests you could hold a conversation with.\nIf you are already writing, use one of your topics from your topic tree.\n2) Brainstorm Your Unique Perspective\nForget everything you know about \u201cvalue.\u201d\nActionable advice and platitudes don\u2019t sell as well as they did when the internet was just budding.\nNovelty catches attention. Attention is a given if you want people to read what you write.\nNovel perspectives are the best (and replicable way) to capture attention without using sleazy tactics.\nHow do you come up with a novel perspective?\nBraindump:\nCommon problems associated with the topic\nBenefits to overcoming those problems\nCommon goals associated with the topic\nRoadblocks to achieving those goals\nPersonal experiences you\u2019ve had\nNow, piece everything together and explain it how you would if you were talking to a friend.\nDon\u2019t try to copy someones perspective or way of wording things. Say it in your own voice and let it refine with time, effort, and practice.\n3) Write 500-1000 Words On The Topic Per Week\nYou need a balance of depth and growth.\nMeaning, you need long form and short form.\nI\u2019m big on starting a newsletter as your long form \u2013 but that can wait at the start.\nFocus on a platform like X.\nWrite threads as your long form once a week.\nWrite 2-3 posts a day.\nThen focus on step 5 the most for growth.\nI will break down how to write these soon.\n4) Deconstruct & Simplify Ideas For Daily Posts\nWriting long-form gives you multiple ideas to pull from.\nDon\u2019t try to copy-paste posts from your newsletters or threads \u2013 rewrite them as standalone short posts.\nWe will discuss this throughout the letter.\n5) Learn How To Get Your Writing Shared (Crucial)\nYour writing means nothing if nobody sees it.\nThis is a huge beginner trap.\nThey think they can write all day and hope that our lord and savior the algorithm will make them an overnight success.\nNo. Writing is 20% of the equation. Traffic is 80%.\nYou get traffic on your profile and writing through replies, networking, and shares.\nI break down every possible way to do this in the How To Actually Grow On Social Media letter.\n6) Monetize Your Experience\nNow that you have writing, a growing audience, and traffic \u2013 the only thing left to do is create a product or service to monetize.\nWe discussed all possible options in last weeks letter.\nAll of this is what we teach in Kortex University \u2013 where an overwhelming amount of students saw audience growth (some getting past the big 1K follower number) this week.\nEverything You Need To Know About High-Impact Writing\nWriting is the vehicle for articulated thought and communication. It is the medium for putting your message in front of those that can adopt the perspective it presents and operate within that shared reality.\nThe Art Of Focus\nThere are a lot of writing frameworks out there.\nAfter trying them all and making connections between them \u2014 I\u2019ve created my own that I see as most effective.\nIf you want to read up on solid writing frameworks and connect the dots for yourself, some of my favorites are:\nPASTOR \u2014 for longer-form writing that works well for persuasive blogs and sales pages.\nAIDA \u2014 a basic framework for shorter-form writing like tweets, email opt-in pages, and sometimes a general structure for long-form content.\nPAS(O) \u2014 great for any type of content writing, short or long form.\nALL of these follow a general storytelling structure that sparks curiosity:\nA problem is introduced or implied \u2014 making people curious about what caused that problem (the law of cause and effect). Hint at the effect and THEN dive into the cause.\nIt exposes people to a potential sequence of events \u2014 this is similar, but makes people want to understand the sequence of events that lead to a particular resolution (happy ending of a story).\nIt creates an information gap \u2014 implying that there is educational, entertaining, or inspiring information that the specific reader desires.\nOnce curiosity is sparked, you must deliver on your promises through:\nPersonal, client, or other experiences that state or imply a transformation. A before (the problem) and an after (the resolution and associated benefits).\nStep-by-step advice on how to get to the resolution quicker (a unique solution).\nA crystal clear call to action to lead them deeper into your other content or spark behavior change \u2014 again, so they can associate that good behavior with you.\nYou do not have to use my framework. You can use any that you\u2019d like. But I have considered these aspects of curiosity and storytelling when crafting my own.\nI call mine the APAG framework.\nAttention, Perspective, Advantage, and Gamify.\nAll are backed by psychological research with the intention of kicking someone into a flow-like experience\u2026 making them associate that good experience with you.\nWhat can this be used for?\nYour newsletter\nPodcast or YouTube scripts\nMultiple threads or medium-form posts\nSales pages, landing pages, or opt-in pages\nBook or eBook chapters or sections\nCourse modules, lead magnet modules, and other education\nPotential ideas for tweets or short-form posts\nAnything else that you use to build your business\nThis section of the letter is pulled from 2 Hour Writer.\nAttention \u2014 The Art Of Hooks And Headlines\nYour hook or headline are the most important aspect of your content.\nIf the hook doesn\u2019t catch their attention \u2014 are they going to read the rest of the content that you put a lot of effort into? Or will they scroll past leaving your hard work gone unnoticed?\nThese are the 3 things that will make them continue reading:\nRelevance \u2014 how relevant is it to their everyday life? Resolved pains or potential benefits. What\u2019s in it for the reader?\nAwareness \u2014 is it simple or complex enough for the level of awareness you are targeting? Will they understand what you are about to show them?\nEffort \u2014 how fast will they receive the result (education, entertainment, or inspiration) and is it easy to get?\nThese do not all have to be included in your headline or hook \u2014 but they should all be considered. The most potent ones should be used.\nIn a newsletter or article headline, you have much less room than a hook in a thread or other medium-form post (like a LinkedIn post).\nNow, we can start to piece together our headline or hook with pieces of our outline and article (the problems, benefits, experiences, etc).\nThe BIG problem \u2014 you can create this by summarizing all of the problems you have listed.\nThe BIG benefit \u2014 again, you can create this by summarizing all of the benefits into one.\nThe BIG idea \u2014 can you summarize the most impactful parts of the post into one sentence?\nThe transformation process \u2014 you can use numbers or a unique name to hint at the process that will get them results (posing an information gap).\nTimeframe \u2014 can you quantify a timeframe for how long it will take them to read the content or get the result you are promising? Use numbers.\nNegative personal experience \u2014 if you include a personal experience in your content, can you imply a low point during that experience and the emotion associated with it?\nTreat all of these as building blocks for the perfect hook.\nYou don\u2019t have to include all of them, especially in the headline.\nBut the hook (the few starting lines of your content) can talk about them to grab the readers attention once they click to read.\nHere is an example of a tweet with a short hook, can you see how it implies a problem, benefit, and transformation in one sentence?\nYou won\u2019t make it without obsession.\n\nBut nobody starts out obsessed. They start out curious. They experiment. They build things. They break things, They fail. And eventually they can\u2019t pull themselves away.\n\nCuriosity turns into obsession with time and persistence.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 24, 2023\nNote:\nThe \u201cattention\u201d part of the APAG framework can be used for the hook or headline of long or short form.\nMeaning, it can be used as the first slide of a carousel, first line of a tweet, the hook of a thread, etc.\nAll of the other pieces below will be treated as sections of long form, or they can individually be used for a short post like a tweet.\nLong form should follow APAG.\nShort form should be A+P, A+A, or A+G.\nIf you can fit them all in one short post, even better, try it.\nPerspective \u2014 Paint A Picture Of The Enemy Or Why A Perspective Is Wrong\nThis is where you relate to and amplify the problems that the reader is currently experiencing. This is also where you create the \u201cenemy\u201d of your story.\nThe best way you can do this is to paint a picture of a common perspective on the topic you are writing about.\nPlace a heavy emphasis on the problems associated with that perspective and the pains they cause.\nThis can be stated directly or implied. Here is an example tweet that paints a perspective without directly stating the problem:\nWake up.\nHit snooze 4 times.\nStare at your phone.\nRoll out of bed.\nMake coffee.\nSit in traffic.\n8 hours of unfulfilling work.\nSit in traffic\u2026 again.\nArgue with your \"significant\" other.\nWalk the pet.\nWatch TV.\nPass out.\nRepeat.\n\nThis should scare the shit out of you.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) February 23, 2023\nFor more firepower, relate to them with a personal experience you\u2019ve had with that perspective.\nThis is how I start most of my articles, newsletters, videos, and threads. I give a personal experience to help illustrate the problem and relate to the readers.\nPeople want to feel understood. If they feel understood, they are more open to hearing what you have to say.\nNot sure what to say in this section?\nGood writing is about piecing together everything you have available to you.\nFor Perspective, you can use:\nProblems\nBenefits\nExamples\nMetaphors\nQuotes or Tweets\nPersonal or popular stories\nComparisons\nConcepts\nAny of those elements (what we call them in Kortex) can be used as a start, transition, or end of a section.\nIf you have writers block, research or think of problems, examples, tweets, comparisons, etc.\nAdvantage \u2014 Paint A Picture Of The Hero, Vision, Or Why Your Perspective Is Right\nNote that any part of the APAG framework can be a single line or an entire section of content.\nAs long as you hit on each part, you\u2019re fine. If you can\u2019t think of anything more to write, move on to the next part.\nWith persuasive writing, you are presenting a credible argument to sell something.\nYOU are always selling, or at least you should be.\nNot only selling products \u2014 but selling ideas and better ways of doing things. That\u2019s what people want. Sell people out of a low-consciousness existence.\nNow that you\u2019ve painted a picture of their faulty perspective and the problems associated with it \u2014 you can start to shift they perspective to view things the way you do.\nHow can you educate people to the point of understanding your perspective?\nWhat do they need to know in order to understand where you are now?\nWhat is missing from your writing that prevents them from understanding your better way of doing things?\nThis is where you can present novel ideas, concepts, social proof, and experiences that make your argument credible.\nIf you have quotes, tweets, or other references you can include \u2014 that will only make your argument more credible.\nHere is an example of an \u201cAdvantage\u201d tweet I wrote:\nWriting is a great skill to learn because it pairs with any other skill or interests.\n\nIf you can write, you can do whatever you want and distribute the value you discover from those pursuits.\n\nWriting allows you to make a living from living. The problem is that most people arent\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 10, 2023\nThis is the turning point in this metaphorical story. You are showing them a better way of doing things.\nAgain, you can use examples, problems, benefits, stories, metaphors, quotes, tweets, etc to help structure your argument and make it more credible.\nGamify \u2014 Create A Hierarchy Of Challenging Goals\nWhen you think of a game, you think of a set hierarchy of goals (or quests, missions, etc) that give people clarity on what to do.\nWhen done correctly, and when you give people a challenge that matches their skill, you put your readers into a flow state of discovering novel ideas that aid in their future.\nIn short, you \u201cgamify\u201d by giving step-by-step advice on how to achieve the transformation you\u2019ve described in the post. (From old problem-ridden perspective to an advantageous perspective).\nYou are wrapping everything up into a clear, concise, and actionable way of getting a specific result \u2014 and making it clear on what they should do next.\nWhat are the steps (or advice) that will help them overcome the problem you mentioned in \u201cPerspective?\u201d\nWhat can they implement right now that will get them results?\nList of steps, key points, or other things like a list of books to read that helps them solve the problem.\nHere is a unique example of a \u201cGamify\u201d tweet I wrote \u2013 this turned into a daily routine newsletter, and could easily be turned into key points for a thread:\nYou need 4 habits:\n\nOne that builds your mind.\nOne that builds your body.\nOne that builds your business.\nOne that builds your relationships.\n\nThe good life is the process of becoming everything you could be.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 12, 2023\nIf This Doesn\u2019t Make Sense Yet (It Won\u2019t)\nYou will have to understand and internalize the structure of most long form content online.\nYou will also have to understand storytelling. They both interconnect.\nHere is the general persuasive writing structure:\nHook \u2014 we\u2019ve talked about this.\nLead \u2014 introducing and agitating the problem\nBody \u2014 key points (numbered or not) separated by headlines to help learn and understand the topic\nConclusion \u2014 a summary or step-by-step advice to overcoming the problem\nCTA \u2014 a call to action to do something next (not necessary on short posts)\nThis IS a storytelling structure.\nStorytelling is NOT always a story.\nStories consist of anecdotes, research, examples, metaphors, quotes, tweets, videos, other content, and anything else you can do to help someone else understand.\nThis is why it\u2019s important to have a second brain (like Kortex) filled with ideas you collect. Writing becomes so easy as it grows. You just piece ideas together in infinite ways.\nYou present a problem and guide someone to overcome it.\nThe Key To Short Writing\nAll of the above can be used to write short posts like tweets, IG posts, LinkedIn posts, reels scripts, and more.\nBut how do you get better at writing them?\nEmulation.\nI learned to write good tweets through observation.\nSince you have ideas flowing from your other writing, take those ideas and:\nStudy quotes from your favorite authors\nUse tools like Twemex to research high performing posts (link)\nBe a researcher not a consumer \u2013 read social media content to study other\u2019s post structures\nFor every post you see, try to recreate it with your own ideas to train your mind to write like that\nDrown yourself in good short form writing.\nUse their sentence structure as training wheels to write your own.\nContemplate why that writing does well. How does it make you feel? Why does it make you feel that way?\nI\u2019ve written an entire letter on how to write short-form content here.\nYou can also download some of my best tweets and use them as training wheels for your content in this PDF.\nAll of this takes practice, a lot of practice.\nBut if you want to earn an income from any other skill you have, you have to pair it with the skill of writing.\nThank you for reading, I hope it helped.\nDan"

        "content": "Throughout my childhood, I was only made aware of one path in life.\nGo to school, get a job, retire with just enough currency to survive until death.\nI was fed the information from my parents, teachers, and friends that solidified that narrow worldview.\nThe dream injected into my mind was to:\nDo well in school\nChoose a major that would increase my earning potential\nAim high and become something like a doctor, lawyer, or engineer\nI didn\u2019t realize I was being trained as a replaceable unit of society.\nI knew there were millionaires, digital nomads, and people doing what they loved for a creative income \u2013 but I never registered it as a possibility.\nIt just seemed so far out there. Too far away. My mind couldn\u2019t fathom doing it, because the only thing I knew was \u201cget a high-paying job\u201d being repeated by those who never decided to pursue their dreams in the unknown.\nEventually, the potential of the digital world made itself apparent to me.\nIn eighth grade, my best friend and I shared a math class with Mr. Schroeder.\nHe was also the after-school weights teacher.\nMy friend and I had decent builds. I had already grown to 6 foot 5 inches tall so he softly bullied us into showing up to an after-school weights class.\nI still remember how weird it felt to lift weights for the first time. Completely different from today where it feels strong and stable.\nMy skinny arms would shake uncontrollably to bench press 65 pounds. The soreness was next level. I didn\u2019t want to go back, but I did.\nWith time and progress, I became obsessed.\nIn high school, my after school routine was:\nDrink preworkout\nGrab my gym bag\nReview my training program (Ogus 7/5/3 at the time)\nHit the gym hard with my friend\nGo back home, make a protein shake, and watch YouTube videos\nThe only channels I watched were fitness channels.\nMatt Ogus, Chris Lavado, Scott Herman, Elliot Hulse, Chris Jones\u2026\nIf you are aware of this era in YouTube fitness, you\u2019re welcome for the good memories popping up in your head.\nThe realization:\nThese creators were doing what they loved, impacting others at scale, and exposing people to their potential.\nThis is when I started to become aware of and deconstruct how I could do the same.\nAfter years of failures with a fitness YouTube channel, digital art Instagram page, multiple marketing agencies, and eventually seeing success with freelance web design while transitioning to a creator\u2026 I found what I was looking for.\nI\u2019m here to make sense of the path for you.\nThe path to purpose, profits, and peace.\nBefore we begin:\nThe Art Of Focus is now available on Amazon. The book contains my practical philosophy to find meaning, reinvent yourself, and create your ideal future.\nKortex University is accepting applications. The next cohort start date is the 26th. If you are interested, it makes to apply now so you have time to join before it closes. Start your digital career in 90 days here.\nCreators Are Decentralized Media Companies\nMedia runs the world.\nMedia shapes culture.\nMedia keeps people in chains.\nMedia exposes people to their potential.\nThe computer you\u2019re looking at? Everything on the screen is media.\nThe billboards you drive by? Shops on the side of the road? Car brands next to you? Song on the radio? Media.\nWe are in a spiritual war of ideas.\nMedia is synonymous with content.\nAnd content is arguably more encompassing than media, so we will use that from now on.\nEverything you hold within consciousness is content. The content of your attention.\nMindful content helps people grow, evolve, and expand their sense of self.\nMindless content encourages decay, stagnation, and defending their low development ego.\nThat\u2019s the game we are playing.\nYou either raise the well-being of humanity by spreading.\nOr you destroy the well-being of humanity by creating content.\nYou are a content creator whether you water it down to a new-age internet job or not.\nYou write texts. You speak to your peers. You persuade your way into a career. You are doing everything that \u201ccontent creators\u201d do, but with a fraction of the leverage.\nAnd as Balaji says, \u201cPhysical, then digital, then native digital.\u201d\nYou will be an internet content creator within the next few decades. It will be a necessity for survival.\nHere\u2019s how you prepare.\nYour Character In Virtual Reality\nYou aren\u2019t a \u201ccreator.\u201d\nYou aren\u2019t a \u201cpersonal brand.\u201d\nYou are just a person who is conscious about their internet avatar and how it will interact with the digital society.\nYou already have an account.\nAre you a consumer \u2013 soaking in value or memes while giving nothing in return?\nOr are you a creator \u2013 contributing to humanity with the value you produce?\nThis is not an internet phenomenon.\nThe masses are consumers. They leach off the government, their parents, the school system, and blow around like a bird in heavy winds. Life happens to them. Life is assigned to them. They don\u2019t realize they are fueling society with attention.\nA select few are creators. They contribute more than they take. They control their destiny by controlling their attention. They encourage the destiny of others by capturing their attention and expanding their consciousness with valuable content.\nAttention is the first step.\nAttention is the root of existence.\nYou have to capture attention if you want any form of success.\n\u201cBut Dan, I don\u2019t want to capture attention, it seems unethical.\u201d\nHave you sat and contemplated this for even 5 minutes? Or are you regurgitating a bad take you found on the internet?\nAre you mad that you are using your attention to read this right now?\nIs it unethical that your attention is drawn to important things?\nIs it unethical that your attention goes to your phone when you get a notification?\nDo you want nobody to capture your attention? So you just want to sit in a void for the rest of your life and never interact with anything?\nWake up.\nLearn to persuade.\nIf you don\u2019t, you are actively choosing to let unethical people win this spiritual war.\nYou aren\u2019t \u201cconscious\u201d by opting out of the game of life. You are arguably less conscious than the sleazy businessman who at least provides a fraction of value with the product he is selling (that genuinely improves some people\u2019s lives\u2026 others, not so much, and that\u2019s okay).\nIf You Don\u2019t Create A Product, You Are Not In Control Of Your Future\nThe ability to earn with your intelligence \u2013 not your time, labor, or looks \u2013 is how you become in control of what you do and how much you make.\nThe Art Of Focus\nTo answer a common shallow (but good) question:\n\u201cHow do I make money online?\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure why this isn\u2019t taught in schools, but no, it\u2019s not from platform revenue like YouTube ad money or X monetization.\nI make about $300 per month from X and $10K per month from YouTube.\nThat\u2019s great, life-changing money, but it took me 5 years to get there.\nIn those same 5 years, I\u2019ve totaled a little over $5MM in revenue. I\u2019ve taken home 90%+ of that.\nI started on Twitter in November of 2019. Before that, I was a freelance web designer.\nIn 2020, I made $100,000.\nTry doing that by growing a YouTube channel and only relying on ad money.\nIn short, how do you make money online? Actual money?\nYou start a business.\nYou need a product and customers.\nShocking, I know.\nYour job, as a business, is to attract people to a product so they can hand you money in exchange for it.\nObviously, there\u2019s a lot more to that, which I\u2019ve covered in previous letters.\nNow here\u2019s the magic click:\nYou write content.\nYou put effort into getting eyes on it (crucial step that everyone ignores no matter how much I tell them because this is where the work comes into play).\nPeople who like your content follow you.\nYou create a product.\nYou market the product.\nYour main lever is content.\nIf you can gain 1 follower you can gain 100,000.\nYour secondary lever is marketing.\nIf you can make $1 you can make $100,000.\nThat\u2019s the new economy.\nThat\u2019s how individuals \u2013 with technology that has sprung up in the last 5 years (so most people still view this idea as crazy, it\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d yet in your eyes) \u2013 earn an income doing what they enjoy.\n7 Digital Career Paths\nTo reiterate, you are building an audience to have a traffic source to your products.\nThat is step one.\nNotice how I didn\u2019t say \u201cyou are writing content,\u201d I said you are \u201cbuilding an audience.\u201d\nThere is a slight difference.\nWriting is necessary, but most people stop there. They don\u2019t put effort into getting their content shared, making their name known in the space, and making friends that help them grow. I discuss growth mechanisms here, but we also provide a network of people who want to help you grow in Kortex University.\nNow, how do you utilize the audience you are building to create a career? To diversify income streams? To set yourself up for a future of freedom?\nI will put these in order of most beginner level to most advanced:\n1) Working For Another Creator Or Brand\nYour profile is your digital resume.\nYour content is how you attract opportunities and gigs.\nThe more people that know what you do = the more people that may hire you.\nNow, understand the network effect\u2026\nIf you \u201conly\u201d have 1,000 followers, but each of those followers has 200-500 followers, and each of those followers has 200-500 followers\u2026\nThen you have an indirect network of 40,000,000 \u2013 250,000,000 people that can spread your name.\nOf course, that\u2019s if every one of your followers shares your posts (impossible). And we have to take into account engagement rate, quality of content, whether those followers even log in to social media, and the chance that they know someone who needs your work at your experience level.\nSo let\u2019s give a very generous 10,000 people per month somewhat knowing who you are and what you do.\nMultiply that by 6-12 months of effort and I find it extremely hard to fail in this game.\nSkills Required:\nIf you want to work for another creator or brand, you need to practice any skill that aids in the growth of your own brand.\nSocial media growth\nContent writing\nEmail copywriting\nFunnel building (landing pages etc)\nBrand design\nLead generation or marketing\nPick one, learn it, implement it, pick the next, learn it, implement it.\nThen, write about it. Give advice. Teach. Some creators may reach out to you. Some you will have to reach out to. None of this is guaranteed, but you can increase your chances at success by growing your audience and reaching out to more creators about helping them with your skill set.\nYou will have to learn them all anyway.\nYou don\u2019t need all of them to see some success, but it only makes sense to continue improving yourself and your business as a result.\n2) Start A Service Business\nYou can go straight into this if you have a skill set that has gotten you results.\nOr you can take what you learn from working with another creator, turn it into a business, and help other creators as clients.\nA service business is a client business. You are charging $1000 to $50,000 (on the very high end) to help clients with your skill set.\nTypes of service businesses (that we care about when just starting online):\nTutoring \u2013 similar to coaching, but you teach your skill to another person 1 on 1. Like if I were to have weekly calls teaching someone web design.\nFreelancing \u2013 obvious, you help a client with whatever your skill set is, like web design which is a good starting point \u2013 but you should learn how to create a better offer because you won\u2019t last long selling something that simple.\nCoaching or consulting \u2013 this is where you help people implement your skill or system. You don\u2019t do it for them like freelancing, you do it with them and guide them.\nAgency \u2013 think of an agency as a freelancing business with employees or contractors that deliver the service. If you don\u2019t have employees or contractors, you aren\u2019t an agency.\nYou start with a service business because your audience isn\u2019t large enough to support another type of business.\nYou only need 2-4 clients at $2000 ish a month to replace your income and make decent money.\nYou will have to learn lead-generation strategies like direct outreach or targeted content to land clients.\n3) Affiliate Marketing\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of affiliate marketing as your sole income source.\nAffiliating for software and products to link in your own products and content? Sure. But if you can sell it, that means you understand it, and you should probably just create your own version.\nAffiliate marketing is when you send your traffic to someone else\u2019s product for a commission.\nSo, if you promoted my 2 Hour Writer course and someone bought, you would get a percentage of that sale (I don\u2019t offer affiliates btw).\nThe only reason I am mentioning it in this list is because it is good for beginner practice.\nYou can build an entire business with zero experience with this option:\nWrite content around the topics of the affiliate product\nPut effort into building an audience\nPromote the affiliate product\nYou don\u2019t need the skill and you don\u2019t need a product.\nSo, this can be good practice while you refine your skill and create a product.\nDon\u2019t get stuck in this phase. Build your own thing.\n4) Digital Products\nOnce you have a large enough audience and have the ability to get results, you can make a decent income with digital products.\nI recommend building one ASAP so you can iterate fast (because most first products will be terrible).\nBut, it makes sense to follow this progression:\nMonetize with a service business\nGrow your audience\nGet results with a service business\nGrow your audience\nTurn what you offer in your service business into a digital product\nGrow your audience\nGet digital product buyers and upsell them on your service\nGrow your audience\nDo whatever you want and quit client work so you have more free time (and desaturate the market for beginners)\nFor simplicity, we are going to consider digital products courses, cohorts, or memberships.\nIf you can sell two $150 digital products a day, you make 6 figures per year in revenue.\nIf we do the math, that means you need to get 80 people to a landing page and convert at 2.5%.\nIf you write an X thread and promote your product at the bottom, you would need around 10,000 impressions to pull this off, more or less.\nIf I have 1,000 followers, but I have a friend who has 10,000 and they share my thread, and if the thread is persuasive, I can almost guarantee I make 2 sales that day \u2013 and that\u2019s with a small following.\nThe cool thing is that even if I don\u2019t make those 2 sales, I am building an audience that may buy my products later.\n5) Sponsorships & Ad Revenue\nYouTube, newsletter, and podcast sponsorships can pay good money.\nBut you need a large engaged audience to do this.\nFor writers, newsletter sponsorships are the most viable \u2013 but why waste that promotional space in your email for someone else\u2019s product?\nThis is the same issue with affiliate marketing.\nJust build your own product and make 2X-10X more than the sponsorship.\nSame with YouTube ad revenue. Stop caring about it. Build your own product or service and take control of your own income.\n6) Physical Products\nIf you want to be hyper-profitable, start with digital products so you can invest in a physical product revenue stream.\nFor physical products, I prefer to sell something that compliment my other products or are something I use.\nThis is why I created the FOCI planner.\nIt compliments my business products and is something I use.\nSomeone like SolBrah or Greg Doucette sell supplements that fit under their training and nutrition philosophies.\nThis is a good step, albeit not as simple or profitable as digital products and services.\n7) Software Or Service Scaling\nAbove, I mentioned that you can build a digital product and quit client work.\nThat is a solid move for a lot of people who don\u2019t want to meet the demands of a growing company (hiring, systems, etc).\nYou can make $1MM to $5MM a year with a growing audience and digital products alone as one person (on the high end, after years of effort and iteration).\nBut, another option is to take it further.\nYou can scale your service business or build something like software.\nYou have such a large audience at this point that you can build whatever you want.\nYou can make $1MM to $5MM a year with a growing audience and digital products alone as one person (on the high end, after years of effort and iteration).\nBut, another option is to take it further.\nYou can scale your service business or build something like software.\nYou have such a large audience at this point that you can build whatever you want.\nWhat Makes A Profitable Product?\nI teach this in Digital Economics, but a \u201cgood\u201d product is a system for behavior change.\nYour philosophy is your brand.\nThe way you live is your product.\nMy philosophy is that people should build their own thing, become sovereign, and do what they want.\nMy product is my writing system that allows people to do that.\nThe way I live is:\nWake up\nWrite for 2 hours (with breaks for creativity)\nHandle other tasks in my business\nThat\u2019s pretty enticing. I have results and a unique system that allowed me do to that.\nThe system came from trial and error toward my end goal (my philosophy of doing my own thing and becoming free).\nIt will take time to get to this point. Be okay with that.\nBuild a product or service anyway and start selling now so you can fail.\nPursue goals so you actually gain experience that you can monetize.\nSitting around and doing nothing keeps you trapped selling for someone else.\nThat\u2019s it for this letter my friends.\nThank you for reading.\nDan"

        "content": "2 months ago, I wrote this in my notes.\nI write occasional letters to myself as an awareness practice.\n(This is edited a bit to flow in the newsletter):\nI can\u2019t find joy in life anymore.\nIt\u2019s not the same.\nRemember when you used to go on long walks while reading or listening to lectures, audiobooks, or podcasts and your mind would light up with ideas?\nYou couldn\u2019t stop writing. Everything felt seamless. That period was like a blur. A 6 month flow state. You built 3 products, gained millions of readers, and even wrote a book.\nIf you had to do it all over again right now, could you do it just as well?\nNo way.\nWhat did your days look like?\nI would wake up, go down to the lake for a walk, sit on a bench in front of that pond, read a book and highlight it nonstop.\nThen, I\u2019d go back home, take a shower, walk 10 minutes to the coffee shop, and write for 2 hours. Those 2 hours every morning built the entirety of your life right now.\nThen, I\u2019d go home again, eat breakfast (you were experimenting with different diets, maybe that\u2019s a clue due to the novelty and dopamine from experimentation), and go out on another walk.\nA little after noon, I\u2019d go to the gym, eat afterward, learn on YouTube a bit, and then go on yet another walk.\nYou\u2019d close the day out catching up with friends, maybe working a bit more, and watching a show.\nIt\u2019s been bugging me too long.\nI knew that there was a way to get back to that higher state of mind \u2013 not necessarily the lifestyle itself.\nI\u2019m not one to complain though (even though that letter-to-self sounds sappy) I like to fix my problems before sharing the solution with you.\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve noticed that these low periods of life are cyclical.\nFor a few months you feel on top of the world. You can\u2019t stop making progress.\nThen, the next few months slow down. You feel good, but things aren\u2019t the same.\nLast, you hit a wall. Your vision is exhausted. You feel lost. Negative thoughts begin to flood your mind \u2013 they can cloud your mind and prevent you from collecting hints at your next purpose in life that sends you down a rabbit hole of obsession.\nThis letter is for those in that final phase.\nThe ones that can\u2019t find the same zest for life that they used to.\nThe ones that can\u2019t find joy in reading a book or walking in nature.\n2 notes before we start:\nMy book, The Art Of Focus, goes live on January 16th. You can preorder the Kindle or Audible version now or wait for the paperback on that date (mark your calendars).\nKortex University \u2013 a college level experience for the creator economy \u2013 is open for enrollment. Start your digital career in 90 days by turning your worldview, interests, and expertise into a flexible online career.\nYour Mind Is A Supercomputer Running The Game Of Life\nWhen our mind is not engaged with being or doing, we allow random thoughts to register in our awareness. \u201cRandom\u201d in this case does not mean half good thoughts and half bad thoughts. For every one good thought, there are a hundred bad ones. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nI want you to think of your mind as a supercomputer.\nYour ability to process information is dependent on a few things, but I want to bring attention to your RAM.\nRAM \u2014 or \u201crandom access memory\u201d \u2014 is one of the most important parts of a computer, it determines performance.\nThe more RAM you use up with different programs running, open browser tabs, and the performance requirements of what you have running, the slower your performance will be.\nThis is no different from your focus, what you hold in your conscious attention.\nHumans can process 10-50 bits of information per second. That adds up to 125 billion bits of information in your lifetime.\nMost people live with multiple high-demand programs running that are draining the limited creative energy they have.\nThoughts about regretful past mistakes\nThoughts about stressful future happenings\nDesires of hunger and entertainment to escape those thoughts\nAn internal cry to break out of their conditioned way of living\nA list of mixed-priority tasks that need to be finished\nOpen loops of tasks they were supposed to complete but forgot about\nThe list goes on and on.\nThe modern mind has its attention split in infinite directions by default. We go about our lives stressed and near sickness. Rather than living in the present with singular focus on a vision for the future and a worry-free mind, we are the opposite. Living in a false reality created by split attention.\nWhen we hold too much of the past or future in the contents of our consciousness, chaos ensues. The mind tends toward disorder. If not kept in check, we lose the sense of control over our lives that leads to enjoyment. This is accomplished through controlled consciousness.\nSingular focus creates clarity. Fragmented focus creates tension. Tension allows stress to sneak in. Stress is the enemy of creativity.\nHow To Win The Game Of Life\nLet\u2019s imagine the 125 billion bits of information you can process in your lifetime as your life\u2019s potential.\nNow, let\u2019s think of your mind as the digestive system of reality.\nIf you \u201ceat\u201d too much information, you get anxious.\nIf you \u201ceat\u201d too little information, you get bored.\nTo maximize life enjoyment, maximize the amount of time you spend at your edge.\nYou win the game of life by finding enjoyment, not pleasure (big difference), in as much of your experience as possible. Your experience is the present moment.\n\u201cWinning\u201d the game of life isn\u2019t an outcome but a process.\nYou are either winning right now, regardless of your emotional state or status in the social hierarchy, or you are losing by projecting out of the present moment.\nIn bodybuilding, the optimal amount of nutrition to fuel muscle growth is just above maintenance. If you eat too much, you feel groggy. If you eat too little, you don\u2019t have enough energy to push hard.\nIn mindbuilding, you must learn and build in unison. Metabolize your experience with daily practice. You don\u2019t know where to go next because you haven\u2019t exposed yourself to the information that acts as a feint light in the unknown.\nIn life, you must push into the unknown to fuel your mind.\nExpose yourself to new information and experience (curiosity).\nCreate something of value with that information to digest it (passion).\nExpand your mind when that experience becomes a part of you with practice (mastery).\nTranscend that phase of life by passing down that value to others (connection).\nThat\u2019s the recipe for the good life:\nCreate, expand, and transcend with the experience you acquire by pursuing self-generated goals that lead you into the unknown.\nCreating Your Own Game (Or Reality)\nEveryone has played a game that they are completely immersed in.\nThey forget everything else, enter the flow state, and may not realize that they are in peak experience \u2013 the beautiful spot where new information is digested as reality flows through them.\nWhen you start playing a game, you go through a tutorial phase that introduces you to the rules, goals, and skills required to play the game well.\nGames are a hierarchy of goals:\nHow to win\nHow to progress to each sub-goal of winning\nUpgrading your character to continue progressing\nEvery level of the game requires a certain level of skill to match the challenge of that level.\nIf you are an absolute beginner, you have no business challenging a higher level. You will lose in that moment and probably quit.\nYou have to go through the same progression as everyone else.\nYou must learn, fail, practice, get better, and expand your knowledge of the game as you progress.\nIn life, it\u2019s no different.\nSo, to get immersed in the game of your own life, you must first create it.\nHow To Reset Your Life In 7 Days\nThis is a process I run through when life gets a bit too messy.\nLike when you\u2019re constantly thinking back to a time when \u201clife was better.\u201d\nOr when your routines fall apart and all of these little tasks pop up that drain all of your time in the day.\nWe are going to run through this process fast\u2026 please put it to use.\nHere\u2019s how you reset your life in 7 days:\n1) Take Note Of How You Feel\nPull out a notebook and write down:\nExactly what you are doing on a daily basis.\nHow you feel morning, afternoon, and night.\nTake 10 minutes and get specific.\nThis is important for identifying unconscious parasites (time and energy suckers).\nI do all of this in the quarterly section of The FOCI Planner.\n2) Get Clear On What You Want\nYou have to realize what you don\u2019t want to figure out what you want \u2013 even if it is destructive \u2013 to realize what you don\u2019t want. Preventing yourself from making mistakes is the stupidest mistake of all.\nIt is impossible to know with absolute certainty what is going to happen in the future.\nThis is why the masses flock to \u201csecure\u201d jobs and belief systems.\nIt\u2019s an illusion of certainty to avoid struggle. You can\u2019t skip making mistakes. Mistakes are your light in the dark.\nStart with a minimum viable vision.\nWhat do you want your life to look like?\nWhat do you want your mind to look like?\nWhat do you want your body to look like?\nGet specific and write down every detail for your future.\nNow, break it down into goals.\nNot for achievement, but for clarity.\nYearly goals and monthly goals.\nYou need direction for your life. Goals are a filter for skills to learn and opportunities to register.\nYour day-to-day experience must be perceived through your vision as the game you are trying to win.\n3) Prioritize, Remove, & Restructure Your Days\nThe reason you aren\u2019t getting the results you used to is because:\nYou feel pressed for time\nYou don\u2019t have the energy to get results\nYou stopped doing the things that got results\nLook over your brain dump from above.\nWhat can you change?\nPrioritize the things that will get results.\nRemove the things that snuck their way into your day (and don\u2019t deserve to be there).\nRestructure specific tasks and obligations to free up more time.\nGet the chaotic structure of your mind on paper and reorganize it.\n4) Cornerstone Habits Of The Good Life\nYou now have direction (goals) and awareness of why you aren\u2019t achieving them (anti-goals).\nNow, you need to cultivate 2 habits to bridge the gap:\nLearning \u2013 for novel information to fuel your skill acquisition and knowledge.\nBuilding \u2013 to metabolize the information and build mental muscle.\nBoth are expensive dopamine.\nStart with 30 minutes of each a day.\n30 minutes of self-education in the morning.\n30 minutes of building a project that will contribute to your vision.\nIf you can\u2019t set aside 1 hour each morning, when distractions are minimal, to build your future \u2013 go back to step 3 and get your priorities straight.\nIf you want, you can learn the high-value skill of digital writing with my course, 2 Hour Writer, to build a future in the new economy.\n5) Create A Week Long Plan\nYou are in this chaotic spot in life because of entropy.\nThe organization of your life (and therefore the mind) tends toward disorder if you don\u2019t perform mental housekeeping.\nThis is dangerous because you can pick up bad habits along the way.\nHabits are difficult to break.\nBut you can make the process easier with clarity.\nTake 10 minutes.\nWrite out every single thing you are going to do for the next week.\nThis shouldn\u2019t sound crazy or difficult.\nThis is how you reduce the friction of making better decisions.\nWrite out:\nYour morning routine\nYour focused work routine\nOther tasks and meetings\nNightly routine\nThe hardest part is not giving attention to the negative thoughts that inevitably pop up when mediocre habits are threatened. Mindfulness is your friend for starting your new plan.\nYou will have to experiment as you go.\nIf the routine doesn\u2019t flow, go back to your notebook and write what you\u2019re going to do the next day.\nThis is how you create a system for your life.\nYou create a system for your life by mapping out your week, sticking to the plan, identifying problems, experimenting with solutions, and repeating the process until you reach your ideal future.\nIt gets more efficient with time if you make this \u2018mental housekeeping\u2019 a regular practice.\nBefore you know it, new skills will become second nature and you will be baffled by how far you\u2019ve come."

        "content": "Last week, our tech founder and product lead for Kortex \u2013 Matthew Ao \u2013 had an epiphany.\nFirst, for those who don\u2019t know, Matthew is a homewrecker.\n13 months ago Joey and I started building Kortex (formerly ValueVault).\n10 months ago we hired one (1) developer to build this second brain app.\nBut not just any second-brain app. One that is actually useful. One that gets results. One that allows you to turn your database of knowledge into impactful writing for content, videos, podcasts, team collaboration, student projects, and more. Eventually allowing us to create a new kind of social media.\nMost \u201csecond brain\u201d apps are just glorified note-taking software.\nOn July 13th and Joey spending $50,000 \u2013 things weren\u2019t going too well.\nOur weekly calls and updates were slow and boring.\nOur zest for the project was fading fast.\nWe weren\u2019t making the progress we wanted to make. And I don\u2019t know what we were expecting to happen with one developer\u2026 but we had never done this before. If you know me, you know I like to just start building things regardless of how much I know\u2026 and it tends to work out pretty damn well.\nAt the time, Joey was helping Dakota Robertson with his ghostwriting cohort.\nI showed up for a guest call to talk about my writing process.\nToward the end of the call, I mentioned that Joey and I were building an app.\nMatthew unmuted his mic, \u201cWait, what kind of app?\u201d\nWe gave some brief details about the app, he said he had some ideas, and we took the conversation to the DMs.\nIn short, he convinced us to burn ValueVault to the ground and start over.\nWe brought him on as a founder.\nFast forward to now and we:\nHave a team of 10 incredible developers, 3 KortexU educators, a design team, and sales team along with the founders that have audiences and leverage to fuel it all (yes, the one-person business is long gone at this point (but is still arguably the best starting point)).\nGenerated $180K in our first month of monetization (without the app being out\u2026 without investors\u2026 story for another time. We just did what I talk about in my business letters).\nBuilt Kortex University to be the best new school and program on the internet for building a digital career as a synthesizer, creator, or writer.\nVisited our dev team in Toronto and strategized the future.\nAre on track for a late January launch of version 0 of the app, specifically for those in Kortex University, not the public.\nHave no plans to accept any VC or investments outside of our own contributions \u2013 we will stick to our philosophy of using technology and social media leverage to grow faster than 99% of startups.\nHere is us at our first in person product demo (for those that were in Canada).\nOh\u2026 and I\u2019m writing this newsletter inside of Kortex \ud83d\ude42\nSo if you notice the fusion of big ideas and lack of writers block, that\u2019s why.\nOkay, back to Matthew\u2019s epiphany:\nCuriosity Is Your Compass In The Unknown\nThe way to do great work is to explore your curiosity. Because every person who\u2019s done great work in history has been the one creating footsteps, not following someone else\u2019s. \u2013 Matthew Ao\nMatthew was authentic enough to mention that this insight came from Paul Graham\u2019s article on How To Do Great Work.\nIt\u2019s obvious that if you want unknown results you must take an unknown path, but people are too quick to adopt the comfort of someone else\u2019s dreams at the expense of their own.\nCuriosity is your compass in the unknown.\nCuriosity is the path of the synthesizer.\nCuriosity is how the world was discovered and built.\nSociety created known (and heavily outdated) paths like going to school, getting a job, and retiring at 65.\nThe mind craves order, and people mistakenly latch onto the order that society has created for them.\nThe mind craves order because it is asking you to do the things that create order from disorder. That is to collect insight from curiosity and create with it \u2013 that is your human edge. Other beings don\u2019t change the direction of evolution like we do.\nToo much order, certainty, and living in the known becomes dangerous for your psyche with time. Eventually, it craves disorder. If you were on \u201cvacation\u201d for too long, it ceases to be vacation, you want to go back home and work.\nIt is the push pull of the Universe.\nEverything unfolds in chapters and phases like a narrative. Your life, your ideas, your self, your city, your community, your business, society, culture, all the way up to the Universe. Trying to stay in one chapter for your entire life is a recipe for emotional turmoil. Life goes on while your mind tries to freeze time.\nSchools and jobs have their merit, but following that known path for too long leads you to an enescapable downward spiral of mediocrity called entropy.\nThose who pursue curiosity are collecting creative firepower to constantly create an evolving order in their lives.\nEntropy states that everything tends toward disorder. That\u2019s what evolution is. The order we latch onto is not permanent, like a job, and falls apart with time. Most people accept this and live out their lives in a sad state rather than pushing toward personal evolution through entrepreneurship.\nIn order to survive as an entrepreneur, you must continue to persist, iterate, and evolve.\nCharles Darwin, Elon Musk, Einstein, and other greats pursued their curiosity.\nThey were synthesizers of experience toward a vision for the future.\nThey reached breakthroughs not by following a regimented curriculum, but by synthesizing what they discovered on the path of curiosity.\nTheir curiosity led them to multidisciplinary study.\nNobody believed in them because they saw something that others didn\u2019t.\nThey were mocked by those of low consciousness and known paths \u2013 because they didn\u2019t have, nor could they replicate the information that came from curiosity.\nI\u2019ve noticed this in my own life.\nMy business results skyrocketed when I stopped studying business (but had a solid grasp on the principles after following others paths).\nThen, I studied philosophy, metaphysics, and psychology.\nI was able to note the same principles in those domains, but from a higher perspective, and enhance my business results because of it.\nThe pattern recognition brought meaning to my life, provided a source of motivation, and gave me a deeper understanding of all domains (because they are all encapsulated under the life domain)\nHamza asked me the other day on a call what led to my growth, and the only thing I can think of (that isn\u2019t boring advice you can get everywhere else) is that I explained the perspective that came from pursuing my curiosity. I didn\u2019t just regurgitate what I\u2019ve been told, I repackaged it for better understanding. I wrote it in my own words.\nMost people can\u2019t know, and never will know, the information that shapes the perspective I\u2019ve gained from pursuing my curiosity. This is why you are the niche. You are a synthesizer of your experience to help others understand.\nYou must have absolute conviction in your ideas and discoveries.\nYou have to be right when everyone is wrong.\nYou have to ignore the opinions that stem from a lack of understanding.\nThey can\u2019t see what you see if you take a rare path in a known domain.\nFew people realize that you can create a path that works by noting the patterns between other\u2019s paths and your own.\nBecause of this, I can\u2019t give a low-level tactical program to bring you certainty.\nI can, however, give you a big-picture guide:\nZoom out and consult with your ideal self\nBecome aware of your goals to generate vision and clarity\nPerceive situations through the lens of those goals to find signal in situations\nCollect information, write about it, build with it, impact others with it\nCreativity is using your experience to actualize a goal\nIf you want to master one domain, acquire general knowledge in the meta domains.\nIf you want to master business, acquire general knowledge in communications, value creation, metaphysics, human nature, psychology, and anything else that is the glue of value exchange.\nBut, you have to actually build the business to digest the knowledge you gain from this pursuit.\nYou can\u2019t just study all day and expect to make progress.\nThe Synthesizer: A New Career Path For Polymaths & Self-Improvers\nThis career path assumes you are ambitious, strive to improve yourself, and enjoy multidisciplinary study.\nIt is for those who are tired of modern jobs and business models.\nYou see the masses with a lack of meaning in work and life.\nYou don\u2019t see a way to break out of the default path.\nYou\u2019re not fulfilled with where you\u2019re headed but love to learn and self-educate.\nWe help people turn their curiosity into a digital career in 90 days with Kortex University.\nWhat Is A Synthesizer\nA synthesizer is someone who takes a unique path with curiosity as their compass, connects ideas to actualize a self-generated goal, and distribute their synthesis to help like-minded people achieve similar goals.\nA synthesizer is an obsessive reality explorer. They understand that reality cannot be compartmentalized into school classes like biology, chemistry, philosophy, and literature. They understand that those aspects of reality have been well documented, and if we want to achieve better results, we must view reality as the connected whole it is. Synthesizers create holistic solutions to profitable problems.\nA synthesizer is a value creator. This is a type of creator on social media that is focused on education and understanding, not memes and excessive entertainment.\nA synthesizer is a DJ but with ideas.\nA synthesizer is a decentralized media company.\nWhen people would write and publish books, a select few would go on live TV to promote it.\nNow, they just post on social media and go on a podcast tour.\nEveryone can be their own media company to earn a living doing what they enjoy.\nAuthors can build an audience and write a successful book without a publisher.\nMusicians can do the same and produce a track without a record label.\nCreatives can do the same and sell a product without being an employee of a company.\nThe path of the synthesizer allows for the potential to do what you enjoy (and earn as much money as you want doing it). Since you don\u2019t rely on someone \u201cabove you\u201d to provide a salary or commission, your earning potential is dependent on your skill, audience size, and creative ability.\nThe Synthesizer Worldview\nIt is difficult to be what you are not.\nIf you don\u2019t have the mindset, values, or beliefs of a synthesizer to shape who you are \u2013 it will be difficult to act on the opportunities presented to you.\nYou change who you are by gradually exposing yourself to \u2013 and digesting \u2013 new information with study and practice. The change will not be instant.\nYou will have to shed old beliefs and develop a thick skin for boomers that tell you to \u201cget a real job,\u201d when they have no idea that this line of work is more secure and profitable than the old jobs that won\u2019t exist in a few years.\nAs you consume books, social media content, and have conversations around your future \u2013 try to make connections with this list of values and beliefs of the synthesizer:\nMoney is a tool for building what you want but doesn\u2019t exist.\nYou live in a time where you can create your own career, rather than be assigned one.\nPersonal responsibility determines the outcome of your life in a decentralized economy.\nYou won\u2019t get average results with average goals. You will get rare results with rare goals.\nCuriosity, reality exploration, and eventual obsession with a craft is your key to greatness.\nSelf-education is a cornerstone habit that you must do every single day, no matter the topic of study.\nHumans are meant to expand, transcend, and create. Constant self-improvement and evolution is not optional. If you as an individual get stuck, so will your endeavors.\nThere is a way to build whatever life you want with technology and the internet. If there isn\u2019t a way, create it.\nWith repetition and training your mind, you can adopt this worldview as your own, and once that happens, it will be difficult not to succeed. Your mind is a system that helps you achieve your goals.\nThe Skills Of The Synthesizer\nLearn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable. \u2013 Naval\nNow, you can\u2019t just \u201cpursue your curiosity\u201d and hope that everything ends up okay.\nThat\u2019s exactly how you become a starving artist.\nAs Naval says, you must learn to sell and learn to build.\nFrom a big picture, this comes down to human nature (selling) and technical know-how (building).\nFrom this, we can group skills into 3 camps:\n1) The Evergreen Skills\nStudying \u201chuman nature\u201d is a difficult task.\nIt can be done through observation and questioning, which should be a habit of yours, but we can make it more practical.\nHuman nature can be connected with mechanics and psychology. The principles of both help you understand and predict human behavior.\nHuman behavior boils down to awareness of a problem, setting a goal to overcome it, and strategizing a plan to achieve the goal. This can be conscious or unconscious. Many people are assigned problems and goals by society, and if society is a behavior system, this explains why most people are comfortable and miserable.\nThe evergreen skills are writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.\nAll together they represent interactions, communication, and value exchange.\nThese skills are the boundaries for how you synthesize ideas.\nHow are your ideas going to be impactful if you don\u2019t understand how to distribute them in an impactful way? How are you going to build an audience if you don\u2019t understand the skill of audience building (communication and value exchange)?\nBuy courses, drown your mind in books and podcasts, and study the evergreen skills like your future depends on it, because it does.\n2) Technical Skills\nTechnology has advanced in a way that massively benefits the individual.\nYou can learn to code, which is a very viable path, but we also have access to tools that allow us to build without learning to code.\nWhat used to take multiple employees now takes one-person and some self-education.\nYou can build a website, landing page, or funnel in under a day.\nYou can write an email and send it instantly (rather than using the pony express).\nYou can download Photoshop and have AI generate an incredible brand asset.\nBuilding digital real estate has become seamless.\nI recommend practicing the evergreen skills almost every day.\nWith technical skills, I recommend learning them as you build a project according to your personal interests.\nIn short, you will have to learn every technical skill associated with building a modern business.\nGraphic design, email marketing, content writing on social media, product hosting, and service tools like scheduling software.\nThis is rather easy nowadays, but will take some time for it to become second nature.\n3) Personal Interests\nHow are you going to learn these skills and ensure that you take a unique path that is worth passing down to others?\nAgain, by pursuing your curiosity.\nIn order to forge your own path, you will have to write, speak, market, and sell channeled through the technical skills you choose.\nPersonal interests provide the direction for your projects.\nPersonal interests stem from becoming aware of problems in your life \u2013 not mindlessly sweeping them under the rug.\nIf I become aware of the fact that being overweight is stunting my potential, and I mean truly aware of how it branches into the quality of every aspect of my life, then I automatically become interested in fitness.\nFrom there, and as I experiment in that domain, I become interested in certain diets, training modalities, and lifestyle choices. This alone creates a unique path.\nNow, if I want to add meaning to that endeavor, I choose to monetize it. Because business is a vessel for living with purpose. I can reap the benefits of passing down my results and lessons to others to raise the well-being of humanity at scale with the internet.\nTo do this well, fitness now serves as my vessel to build and sell with the evergreen and technical skills.\nThe Habits Of The Synthesizer\nIf you want to become a synthesizer, you have to be a synthesizer.\nThat doesn\u2019t make much sense, so let me explain.\nYou aren\u2019t getting the results you want because you aren\u2019t the person that would get those results.\n\u201cWho you are\u201d is composed of your worldview or perspective.\nYour perspective influences your perception of situations (yes, I repeat this often, because it is the most important thing to determine the outcome of your life.)\nYour perception of situations determines the choices available to you, and from there, you make a decision that benefits a conscious or unconscious end goal.\nWith time and conscious practice, these decisions become habitual.\nSo, who you are is a dance between perspective and habits.\nYou don\u2019t adopt the worldview we broke down above as your perspective overnight.\nYou slowly introduce habits into your life that push you into the unknown and expose you to positive feedback that reinforces the identity you are trying to create.\nYou must adopt the lifestyle of the synthesizer \u2013 on a smaller scale \u2013 if you want to become a synthesizer.\nThis goes for anything you want in life. It must be embodied in your daily life.\nWith time, and as you get the results that allow you to, you increase the time spent on those habits so it becomes your full time lifestyle.\nYou must be a part time synthesizer first, then go full time when you are ready.\nWe can condense these habits into 2 simple blocks that you can increase with time and results:\nHabit 1) Productivity Blocks\nProductivity blocks are for building, creating, and maintaining.\nDuring this 30-90 minutes:\nEngage in focused work\nWrite content to build a readership\nBuild a product to provide value to that readership\nThat\u2019s it. Those are the levers. You must set aside time to build a potentially profitable project that can replace your source of income. You must also acquire customers for that product so you can transition to full time.\nOn that note \u2013 the new FOCI Planner is available to order. I know a lot of you were waiting for a physical planner.\nThat contains the exact system I use to structure my focused work blocks:\nCreate a minimum viable vision for the future\nDeconstruct it into monthly, weekly, and daily goals\nSet your priority tasks to achieve those goals from the bottom up\nIterate your vision as you learn what you do and don\u2019t want\nThis process alone creates clarity for habit 2.\nHabit 2) Creativity Blocks\nCreativity blocks are for idea capture and connection that can be used for your creation (those are the 3 tabs in the Kortex app).\nDuring this 30-90 minutes:\nGo on a walk. Get away from distractions and use this time to listen to videos, podcasts, books, or read in alignment with your vision.\nHunt for ideas. To be creative, you must collect novel ideas that catch your attention so you have something to synthesize into your writing or building.\nContemplate. Rest and let your Default Mode Network activate. Move your focus inward and let ideas bounce around as you contemplate and connect them to create novel perspectives for your writing and building.\nProductivity and creativity blocks are not optional as a synthesizer. These are the 2 things you must do on a daily basis.\nThe Main Lever Of The Synthesizer\nYou are a writer.\nAlmost everyone is.\nThe sooner you realize and accept this as a part of your identity, the better you can get at it.\nWriting is how you:\nSend emails\nWrite content\nWrite video scripts\nWrite advertisements and promotions\nSend networking DMs\nClarify your ideas to enhance your speaking (in text messages, conversations, videos, and anything else\u2026 writing can and should come first).\nI am not talking about technical or academic writing.\nI am talking about impactful writing.\nWriting rooted in persuasion, marketing, sales, human nature, and psychology.\n(Good) writing is how you turn words into value.\nYou don\u2019t \u201cjust write\u201d about whatever you want whenever you want.\nYou must base your writing around the fundamentals of your readers psyche:\nBurning problem \u2013 imply or state a problem they want to solve.\nDesirable goal \u2013 preferably a goal from your vision so you can attract people like you (those who you can help most).\nPath to bridge the gap \u2013 from personal experience, your system to achieve that goal.\nI\u2019ve broken this down before in the Value Creation letter.\nWriting is how you synthesize ideas into something tangible so you can improve them with time.\nWithout writing, your ideas will not get better, and neither will your results.\nAnd, you won\u2019t be doing the one thing that puts your value in front of other people.\nMonetization Paths Of The Synthesizer\nYour monetization paths and revenue streams are endless as a writer, creator, or synthesizer:\nWriting a book\nSelling digital products\nSelling physical products (like a planner)\nSelling mentorship, coaching, or consulting\nFreelancing with writing or any other evergreen/technical skill or personal interest\nAll of these paths are low-cost (aside from physical products) and allow you to make a living doing what you enjoy.\nYou can observe the creator economy and see that people are earning from these options with almost any interest imaginable (don\u2019t get stuck in an echo chamber thinking that only certain things sell better than others).\nBuild your base of readers, then build whatever you want.\nAnd once you have the cash flow and readership that allows, you can build literally any kind of business you please, like how we are building Kortex.\nLastly, a promotion.\nIf you want to become a synthesizer in 90 days, apply to be one of the few students in Kortex University.\nBe mindful of the next cohort start date.\nThank you for reading and enjoy your weekend.\nDan"

        "content": "Obsession is your key to greatness.\nExpose yourself to more experience, not distraction, and let curiosity pull you down a rabbit hole of discovery.\nOnce you find the thing you can\u2019t pull yourself away from, work to make it a sustainable part of your life.\nThis is a lesson I discovered in my childhood.\nI have always been obsessed with finding a better way of living.\nEverywhere I went, I paid close attention to people\u2019s actions. Not for the sake of judgment, but discernment. I wanted to understand what actions led to a good life and which led to a bad life.\nI often found myself questioning what, how, and why.\nWhat were they pursuing?\nIf every action is toward a conscious or unconscious goal, it seemed like everyone was eager to be overweight, unhealthy, overworked, and broke. They didn\u2019t have self-generated goals that shaped their decision-making.\nHow did that person get to where they are?\nWhy did they look that way?\nWas it because they picked up a 1000-calorie dessert drink for breakfast with a sandwich that leaked grease from its wrapper?\nWhy did they go to the same job that clearly caused them immense suffering?\nHow did they not see the opportunity all around them? The digital world unfolding right before their eyes? A world of information and technology they can use to learn and build in record time?\nDue to my questioning, I had conditioned myself to think that getting a 9-5 job was the worst outcome that could happen in my life.\nIt seemed like once people accepted a job offer, they were doomed to a life of comfort.\nThey would fill their plate with never-ending responsibilities \u2013 a mortgage, spouse, and kids \u2013 before they had the financial capability to truly dedicate their time and energy to those things. It looked like they were quick to become an adult, but were never able to reap the rewards of being one.\nThey chained themselves to a paycheck because they never made the choices that led to more money and time.\nThe danger of employment goes far beyond this.\nBefore we dive in, Kortex (the software) is nearing completion. Kortex (University) are the one\u2019s who get early access along with a revolutionary curriculum for the future of work (that schools can\u2019t teach).\nThe Psychology & Danger Of Employment\nI see 9-5 jobs as a stepping stone.\nMy problem with them is that they breed complacency and are dangerous for your psyche.\nChallenge is what makes life fun and interesting.\nIf you halt your personal evolution by never pursuing something more, you lose purpose and fulfillment.\nEntrepreneurship is the only logical option for long-term thinkers.\nEntrepreneurship is the path of uncertainty.\nLike slashing your way through the jungle.\nYou are required to learn skills that aren\u2019t taught in schools.\nYou are required to be okay with failure, rejection, and slow progress.\nYou are required to learn from your mistakes, show up again tomorrow, and push until your strike gold.\nYour psyche is wired to hunt.\nThe physical world has changed much faster than our mind can adapt.\nWe still have the same neurobiological processes as our ancestors.\nIf you stay in a 9-5 job for too long, you become a monkey in a cubicle.\nWhen you get stuck in a 9-5 (or a new 9-5 like an agency or freelancing) you live in the eternal known. You can\u2019t make new discoveries in the known.\nYou get bored, depressed, and see life as meaningless because the only dopamine you get is from superficial sources.\nYou never take risks, push into the unknown, and discover new knowledge, tools, and potentials that raise dopamine levels in the brain.\nAs an entrepreneur, you \u201chunt\u201d for your survival by gathering knowledge, creating a valuable product, and putting it in front of people who could benefit from it.\nYou don\u2019t have to hunt for your food, but you have to hunt for the resources to acquire food, like money to put toward a better future.\nAristotle condemned manual labor as harmful to the body and soul.\nThe Ancient Greeks saw work as a necessary part of life. But only as a means to leisure, creativity, and contemplation as they considered them the keys to happiness.\nWithout work, leisure loses its meaning and vice versa.\nLife begins to lack balance and contrast.\nManual work isn\u2019t always bad. But completing mindless tasks for the sake of survival or status makes you no different than a robot or animal.\nThe Future Of Work Is Play\nThere are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies. \u2014 Naval\nMoney is a tool for building what you want but doesn\u2019t yet exist.\nIt\u2019s not for the material acquisition of cars and houses (although those can be achieved through a deeply spiritual vessel like business, investing, or self-development).\nTechnology and the internet are how you build a solution that leads to personal and collective progress.\nEvolution is about solving problems with technology.\nThat\u2019s what we do as humans. That is our edge. That is what sets you apart from other beings and has led to the complex world we live in filled with skyscrapers, libraries, sports, and the infinite internet.\nWe build, create, and solve our own problems with a plan, focus, and creativity.\nHumans have the innate drive to survive the information in their genes and consciousness.\nWe have built technology since the dawn of time for the sake of life extension and youth extension.\nThe drive to preserve our physical bodies is natural, but it\u2019s not for the reason that most people think.\nHumans survive on the conceptual level.\nWe attempt to reproduce the contents of our minds.\nThe ideas, beliefs, and values that make us who we are.\nIs a child just a physical body? When they are born, do they have a \u201cself?\u201d Are you creating a child just by birthing them physically? Or are you spewing your spiritual seed into their minds to create their identity?\nFor us to become immortal, the drive to survive our physical form and extend our youth is necessary to increase the time in which we can spread our ideas to ripple throughout consciousness and (hopefully) win the battle of good against evil. The biosphere (biology) must remain intact for the noosphere (mind) to expand and transcend to whatever is next.\nIn this sense, it makes sense why we do what we do.\nAuthors write books to become immortal and pass down their ideas to create selves around the world.\nAuthors and creators have had more children than Genghis Khan.\nWe read books and adopt ideas that align with our goals as a part of our identity.\nAnd since most people have the goals that society assigned to them, they are perceiving and storing information that reinforces their identity. The masses are the children of society.\nThis all points a finger at the future of work.\nThrough evolution and technology, we have been removing labor work from our eyes.\nTo me, this seems like the human drive to pursue creative work further to advance the expansion and unity of mind and consciousness.\nWe want to do what we want, when we want, in a positive direction by pursuing our interests, solving our problems, and building solutions that create heaven on Earth.\nNever has this been more of an option for the majority of the population.\nWe have the technology available to us to create our ideal lives with the internet.\nThe Digital Renaissance\nThe future of work, in my eyes, belongs to the creative.\nThe writers.\nThe designers.\nThe speakers.\nThe builders.\nThe creators.\nThe synthesizers.\nThe highest-paid individuals are and will be those who use the creative ability of their mind to solve problems that prevent progress in humanity.\nThis is what I teach in 2 Hour Writer.\nIdeas are the building blocks of a better future.\nIdeas are the primary pursuit of the creative worker.\nWhat people don\u2019t realize is that there is a way to achieve impossible ideas. You just need to create a path that allows you to actualize that reality.\nElon Musk wanted to land on Mars.\nA few years ago, this was impossible, but it is becoming more and more possible by the day.\nHe didn\u2019t start with SpaceX.\nHe made smart choices (among many dumb ones, you can\u2019t skip making mistakes) to the point of having companies, capital, and a path to land on Mars.\nMost people try to make the impossible possible but fail because they skipped building the ideas that must come before.\nThe plow came before the tractor.\nThe filing cabinet came before a second brain.\nThe horse-drawn carriage came before the car.\nAnd most of the time, people didn\u2019t know that the car could have existed had they not built the other solutions that made it a possibility.\nIn a practical sense, you have no idea what is possible for your future. And you will never find out if you don\u2019t build a solution for the personal problems in your life.\nWe are going through what seems to be a second Renaissance. A digital one. An eternal one.\nAs we expand to new planets and the human race hits trillions in numbers, there will be thousands of Einsteins and Nietzsches.\nWe are back in a time where artists, thinkers, and creatives are rewarded for their risk.\nThis is not a time for specialists.\nNor is it a time for generalists.\nWe live in a time of specialized generalism.\nYou must laser in on a specific vision for the future and acquire the general skill and knowledge that will actualize each ascending goal that creates that vision.\nSuccess is not as simple as learning one skill.\nAs we will find, self-education and skill acquisition \u2013 for life \u2013 in alignment with a self-generated goal is your key to sovereignty.\nThe New Economy\nThe Universe divides and reunites like the ocean evaporates and condenses back down into rain.\nWe will call this a cycle of centralization and decentralization.\nSocial media has caused a shift from centralized media to decentralized media.\nSynthesizers \u2013 or creators \u2013 are decentralized media companies.\nThey compose the new public school system that is available to anyone with an internet connection.\nIndividuals are creating new jobs, teaching new information, and creating new paths that schools and government can\u2019t keep up with.\nFew people recognize the importance of social media as the new digital society.\nMost people see it as a place to entertain themselves and use to complete a few tasks at work.\nIn reality, media shapes culture, society, and the economy.\nMedia is how we learn.\nMedia is how we get new information.\nMedia is how we communicate the value of our businesses.\nMedia consumes a large portion of our lives. It creates a social fabric that people rely on for civilization to operate as it does.\nSocial media is the collective consciousness that spreads ideas for people to adopt as a part of their identity.\nIdentity influences perspective. Perspective influences perception. Perception influences what we deem important or valuable to our lives.\nSocial media, whether you are on it or not, changes our behavior on a personal level and ripples throughout society through communication. Social media is creating new selves with the ideas hosted on it and adopted from it.\nA creator can send out a message to millions of people in the blink of an eye. Imagine trying to send a message to one million people 50 years ago. It would have taken months if not much longer.\nSocial media changes how we spend our money because it changes what message is adopted and spread by creators.\nThere are the synthesizers who pursue their own goals, collect ideas to creatively achieve them, and distribute a valuable message to their readers.\nThen there are the general influencers who attract the masses with looks, rather than depth, for the sake of reinforcing their ego. They may be unconsciously leading society toward a dead end.\nThe world needs more synthesizers.\nThe value creators explore unknown crevices of reality and distribute ideas that others can build with the technology available to them that leads to collective progress.\nIf you want to become a synthesizer, this is why I started Kortex University, you can apply for admissions here.\nWith automation and AI seeing exponential growth, it only makes sense that people will get their media fix from humans.\nPersonal brands. Creators. Synthesizers. Same thing, different nuance and impact.\nPeople who educate, entertain, and inspire according to their interests.\nUnless we rewrite the collective psyche (which hasn\u2019t changed much in a few hundred years) then this is inevitable. People are attracted to people, not robots.\nRobots have their place in decreasing labor and increasing human creativity, though.\nModern business is an extension of the self.\nIt is a vessel for your purpose.\nYour purpose evolves, and you must solve the superficial problems in your life to reach your deepest purpose.\nThe pattern here are the eternal markets (where the most money flows).\nHealth, wealth, and relationships.\nSolve your own problems by acquiring the skill and knowledge necessary to do so through the internet.\nPass down what you learn in the form of free content and paid products.\nBy doing so, you not only create an independent income source, but massive social leverage.\nThe new economy is composed of creators that sell products which lead to progress within their community.\nSome sell information. Some sell cotton clothes because they see danger in polyester as an endocrine disruptor. Some sell skin care products.\nAs the barrier for product creation lowers thanks to technology, we can earn a living doing what we enjoy while improving ourselves (and those in our community or readership) beyond measure.\nHow To Create Your Own Career\nCuriosity leads to learning.\nLearning leads to obsession.\nObsession leads to a life that you never thought was possible.\nA life filled with enjoyment, winning, and an impact on those who see the value in the path you\u2019ve carved out of reality.\nWith the \u2013 rapidly evolving \u2013 technology available to use, we no longer have to remain a puppet of society.\nWe can make the conscious personal choice to use the tools that have been built for us in the new economy.\nWe have the chance to create a career, not be assigned one.\nThis is the career path of the future, the direction you take is your choice within it:\nSelf-Education\nA synthesizer is a Digital Renaissance Man.\nThey are constant self-educators.\nThey acquire the knowledge and skill to actualize their goals.\nThey let the goals they create, not the one\u2019s society assigned to them, be their interest compass.\nThe future of work is based on creativity, not productivity.\nCreativity is using your diverse knowledge that you acquire from learning skills and interests to achieve a goal.\nIf you have not learned anything outside of what you have been told to learn, you probably haven\u2019t invested in your own goals, and you have a long way to go.\nAs discussed in last weeks letter, goals shape the entirety of your life, identity, and the knowledge you acquire.\nThis is less about becoming an expert in certain skills and interests.\nThis is more about having a constant influx of information to fuel what you are building to achieve your goals.\nIf you haven\u2019t started yet, you must start with the foundation.\nMind, body, spirit, and business.\nEducate yourself on how to solve the most burning, profitable problems in your own life and others.\nIf you want to make money reasonably fast, you must solve your superficial problems and help others solve theirs.\nDo your part in raising the collective consciousness by helping others transcend the problems that keep them in a lower state of consciousness.\nLearn, build, and sell a product around fitness, relationships, mental health, and financial freedom.\nBy pursuing these goals, your path will be unique. It\u2019s obvious that nobodies path is the same. The knowledge you acquire by achieving these goals is unique to you.\nEverybody\u2019s niche is self-actualization.\nBefore this technological revolution, people did not self-actualize in public.\nThe ones building rockets are also in the self-actualization niche. They are advancing human potential.\nBut, you have the ability to improve yourself, earn from it, and then pursue whatever you want.\nCode & Content\nTo take advantage of the future of work there are certain skills you must acquire.\nThe Meta Skills\nCode and content create the internet.\nThey umbrella every other skill you will need to learn.\nAnd if everything that can be done on the internet will be done on the internet, learning these is not optional.\nResults Oriented Skills\nYou don\u2019t need to learn to code, but you need technical know-how.\nYou need to understand the tools you can use to build a better life.\nEmail marketing, graphic design, video editing, website and funnel building\nThese are all technical tools to help you establish your foothold as a personal brand in the digital society.\n\u201cCode,\u201d in this sense, is digital real estate.\nLearn everything you can to build more digital real estate that people can find and follow.\nThe Evergreen Skills\nCode is the vessel for content, and content is the only way to get in front of others to attract them to your product.\nWriting, speaking, marketing, and sales are the skills that provide the impactful message for your results oriented skills.\nYou can\u2019t just write a social post and expect it to do well.\nYou need to understand mechanics and psychology.\nMarketing and sales are applied mechanics and psychology.\nPersonal Interests\nNow, you are learning the vast array of skills that are required to build a business (your digital resume) in today\u2019s age on social media.\nYou\u2019ve learned to write, speak, market, and sell through your emails, content, and web pages.\nThat \u2013 plus actually posting things \u2013 is how you start to build an audience.\nBut your personal interests are what set you apart and determine what you sell.\nAny of the above relating to business can be considered personal interests, but so can anything you\u2019ve learned studying the mind, body, or spirit.\nYour job is to use your skills to monetize the interests that make you unique.\nEmployees & Entrepreneurs\nMost people dream of being the CEO of a billion-dollar company but can\u2019t even be the CEO of their own life.\nThe employee mindset is a difficult to break:\nYou don\u2019t pursue anything other than what you know\nYou don\u2019t continue developing your skillset beyond the work that is assigned to you\nYou wait to be told what to do in your work and life, you don\u2019t make the decision yourself\nYour parents are still your bosses even though you\u2019ve moved out. The programming still tugs at your mind.\nEntrepreneurs have a distinct set of traits that align with our ancestors and nature:\nThey push into the unknown and create new paths\nThey build solutions to creative problems that advance humanity\nThey never stop acquiring knowledge and applying it in reality\nYou can take either path in the new economy.\nEmployers hire based on your social media.\nCreators hire based on your social media.\nBrands hire based on your social media.\nClients hire based on your social media.\nCustomers buy based on your social media.\nYou can be an employee, but understand that entrepreneurship is an eventual step you will have to take if you want full control over your life and income.\nAssigned & Created Products\n\u201cEveryone has a product nowadays.\u201d\nI saw this under a post by Chris Williamson promoting his new productivity drink.\nThe commenter said it as a negative.\nAs if they aren\u2019t working for someone else who has a product.\nYes, everyone has a product nowadays. Because it is a requirement if you don\u2019t want to be assigned a product to sell.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sell, it\u2019s sleazy.\u201d\nThen you dont understand sales. You are selling me your ideas right now to reproduce and survive your narrow identity.\nBy doing nothing, you allow people less conscious and intelligent than you to have more attention, impact, and money than you.\nBy doing nothing, you become a puppet to society and are assigned an unconscious life to live of selling others products and never realizing it.\nCreate a product that you would buy, use, and benefit from.\nThat is the only shortcut in business.\nYou belong to a niche, you have purchased products from that niche, and if you understand anything about business, you should skip 50% of the trial and error and sell what you\u2019ve bought, but better.\nDistribution & Leverage\nBuild distribution, then build whatever you want. \u2013 Jack Butcher\nHow to start a billion-dollar company:\nDon\u2019t.\nStart as one person.\nLeverage the technology available to you.\nDeploy digital real estate until you have ample distribution of your products and services.\nWrite posts every single day that live on your profile.\nNetwork with people to get them shared (so you can grow without the algorithm).\nGet on podcasts to build your authority.\nPlug your newsletter so you own your audience.\nGive away small free products to build your newsletter more.\nSell a low-ticket product to have more people dedicated to your brand.\nWith an audience of 10,000, newsletter of 1,000, and network of 100 \u2013 you can do anything you want.\nYou have the resources to make a full time income at this point.\nBeyond that, you can funnel extra cash into building your dream company or investing.\nThis letter was for big picture understanding.\nFor practical steps, click on any of the links in this letter for previous letters of products to help.\nThank you for reading.\nDan\nP.S.

        "content": "Most people, even though they don\u2019t know it, are asleep. They\u2019re born asleep, they live asleep, they marry in their sleep, they breed children in their sleep, they die in their sleep without ever waking up. They never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence. \u2013 Anthony De Mello\nPeople are living on autopilot.\nEveryone was assigned goals by society as a child.\nGoals require a system to be achieved.\nA system takes trial and error to become efficient.\nYou had the biological goals of walking, talking, and speaking to survive.\nAs simple as they are for you now, that wasn\u2019t always the case.\nYour mind received negative feedback from your environment that led to those systems becoming efficient to achieve your goal of surviving.\nYour parents either scolded you or pointed you in the right direction when you made a mistake.\nYou started crawling, then stumbling around, then walking like a toddler with little balance, and now you can (hopefully) walk like an Olympic gold medalist can flip through the air and stick the landing \u2013 because they practiced achieving that goal long enough.\nLearning to walk is just the start.\nWhat about the goals of going to school, getting a high-paying job, and retiring at an age where you have little time left to enjoy your life?\nSociety is a behavior system.\nAnd those are 3 big goals that they injected into your mind right when you learned to comprehend the language you speak.\n99% of people are only interpreting everyday situations in a way that leads to those goals.\n99% of people are practicing the skills and programming their minds to live a mediocre life without even knowing it.\nThe masses are being shepherded to an unfulfilling life because the systems that compose their mind, identity, perspective, and perception are becoming more efficient as they age.\nA realization people often make too late:\nSuccess is not planned, it is automatic.\nSuccessful people \u2013 whether they were conscious of it or not \u2013 had a mind that was programmed to achieve the goals that led to their success.\nThink of your mind as a structure of nested systems.\nYour identity, perspective, and perception of situations are all systems that feed into and reinforce each other in that order.\nI am here to make you conscious of the systems that lead to automatic success in any endeavor.\nGoals > Systems\n80% of living the life you want boils down to creating your own goals while most people are mindless slaves to society\u2019s goals.\nGoals change how you interpret situations, which influences your actions, which programs your identity, which compounds over years into the good life.\nYou can\u2019t solve a problem unless you\u2019re aware of it.\nYou can\u2019t become aware of a problem unless it impacts a goal.\nMost people don\u2019t have goals. Most people are afraid to make mistakes. Most people don\u2019t give themselves a chance to improve any aspect of their life.\nIf you aren\u2019t clear on what you want, you can\u2019t communicate what you want to others.\nThis sets you up for a life of assumptions, expectations, and never getting what you want out of life. Nobody can help you and you can\u2019t help yourself.\nIf you don\u2019t invest energy into a goal, you won\u2019t feel the pain of not reaching that goal.\nOccasional, non-alcoholic-level drinking wasn\u2019t a problem until it took away from achieving my goal of a fulfilling relationship.\nI never saw it as a problem until I was made aware that I was acting \u201coff\u201d for a few days after. I thought I was acting normal. If I had never invested energy in the goal of a relationship, or deemed it more important than the pleasure of having a few drinks with dinner, I never would have noticed its impact. That\u2019s my point.\nMost don\u2019t have a clear vision of what they want from that goal, so the negative impact of their actions goes unnoticed.\nYour bad habits don\u2019t seem worth quitting because you don\u2019t have responsibilities (or prioritize those responsibilities) that deserve you at 100% capacity.\nIf the importance of those responsibilities outweighed the pleasure of your bad habits, you\u2019d stop without question.\nGoals are intertwined with identity.\nHumans survive on the conceptual level.\nWe feel threatened when that which makes us, us is threatened.\nA bodybuilder will feel stress and pain when they are in an environment that provides less control over their training and diet.\nA routine is a set of practical goals that order the mind. A writer who moves to a new location or travels for an extended period of time will have a stressful acclimation period until their mind runs on new systems. If they can\u2019t write well in their normal routine, they feel threatened, because \u201cwho they are\u201d may die.\nI discuss the importance of routines \u2013 even if you think you don\u2019t need or have one \u2013 in The Daily Routine That Changed My Life (4 Focus Habits).\nThe general misunderstanding here is that you either have a goal or you don\u2019t.\nYour mind is a web of conscious and unconscious goals with accompanying systems to achieve them.\nYou had biological goals as a child to walk, eat, and survive. It\u2019s seamless for most people because they\u2019ve practiced.\nThe system is efficient.\nYou may have cultural goals, depending on how you were raised, of fitting in and following the safe path according to that culture.\nIf you were to condition yourself with new stimuli (constant self-education) to the point of having an identity that couldn\u2019t \u201csurvive\u201d without achieving new goals \u2013 you would inevitably achieve whatever they are with ease. If you want a successful business, relationship, or anything that is out of the norm, you must fundamentally change the goals your mind operates on by changing who you are.\nTo change who you are you must educate, practice, and experience new information to reprogram your mind\u2019s faulty wiring that was installed by society.\nThe Mind Is A System That Helps You Achieve Your Goals\nMan is by nature a goal-striving being. And because man is \u201cbuilt that way,\u201d he is not happy unless he is functioning as he was made to function \u2013 as a goal striver. Thus true success and true happiness not only go together but each enhances the other. \u2013 Maxwell Waltz\nThis quote from Psycho Cybernetics can be connected to another from Flow.\nThe optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy\u2014or attention\u2014is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nHumans are goal-oriented creatures.\nAnd goals create systems.\nSystems don\u2019t exist without goals (take that, James Clear).\nThe mind has two key purposes for survival:\nAchieving known goals\nDiscovering unknown goals\nThe mind is an information processing and pattern recognition machine that we have a certain amount of control over based on our level of consciousness.\nThe mind is a system \u2013 containing a complex set of systems \u2013 that accepts, rejects, and uses information to aid in the goals you feed it.\nIf you\u2019re always focused on negative outcomes, they will become reality, and you\u2019ll blame everyone but yourself for the misfortune in your life.\nThe man who conceives himself to be a \u201cfailure-type person\u201d will find some way to fail, in spite of all his good intentions, even if opportunity is dumped in his lap. The person who conceives himself to be a victim of injustice, one who \u201cwas meant to suffer,\u201d will invariably find circumstances to verify his opinions. \u2013 Maxwell Waltz\nIn other words, if you think you can, you can, and if you think you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t.\nAt the root of your mind, like a puppet master, is your identity.\nIdentity is synonymous with self-image or personality for the sake of this letter.\nYour identity is a system of ideas, beliefs, values, and standards that shape your perspective.\nYour perspective is like the lens of a camera.\nYou can zoom in and out.\nYou can focus on one part of the scene \u2013 while the background is blurred \u2013 or focus on the detail of the entirety of the scene.\nYour perspective influences your perception of situations.\nMeaning, your identity will limit the information it can perceive, and if it receives information that does not match its beliefs, values, or standards it will reject it.\nYour mind automatically accepts and rejects information that aids in the achievement of the goals that are programmed into your head.\nIf you want to get a job, dopamine will signal the importance of information and opportunities that help you get that job.\nYour book highlights will reflect that goal. How you approach conversations (with anyone) will reflect that goal. What you engage with on social media will reflect that goal (and the algorithm will help deepen the roots of that identity by showing you more of that information, for better or worse).\nIf you want to quit your job, dopamine will do the same thing, but for information that provides the opposite effect.\nYour Google searches will change from \u201cbest careers to go into in 2024\u201d to \u201cbest businesses to start in 2024.\u201d\nOr, you\u2019ll be more compelled to check out Digital Economics where I help you deconstruct your identity and turn it into a profitable one-person business.\nYour book highlights in even something like a novel will be vastly different from someone else with a different goal.\nWith or without knowing it, we are all reinforcing our potentially mediocre identity that determines the outcome of our lives. For most people, this will be negative.\nIf you want to change the outcome of your life, change who you are.\nIf you want to change who you are, change the direction of your life.\nExpose yourself to new experiences, environments, and information to allow your mind a chance to discover new goals you can adopt that will carry you toward a better future.\nThe Mastery Method \u2013 How To Learn Anything, Fast\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you are going to have to learn\u2026 a lot.\nEducation expands your mind.\nIt introduces you to novel perspectives.\nIt increases dopamine in the brain as a consistent source of energy.\nIt gives you the knowledge to act with clarity toward your goals.\nIt exposes you to the potentials that you hadn\u2019t yet become aware of.\nA consistent flow of education increases your chances of encountering meaningful events.\nMeaningful events occur at the edge of the known, when your nervous system signals that you should pay attention.\nWhen you have one foot in the unknown, you can just barely metabolize new aspects of reality and put that information to use.\nBecoming the person you want to be is the most painful and rewarding process you can dedicate your life to.\nYou begin this path when you realize that the pain and pleasure of where you are now are of lesser magnitude than the pain of not receiving the rewards that come from seeing what you are capable of.\nWith that, let\u2019s discuss how to master almost anything as you trek toward becoming a new you:\n1) Expand Your Mind\nAll real change is identity change.\nYour level of mind dictates what values, beliefs, and standards are available to your identity.\nYou don\u2019t care about global problems because you haven\u2019t solved the personal problems that restrict your mind from seeing them as important.\nThe purpose of humanity is to expand your level of mind to that of The Universe.\nYou must allow yourself the room to discover new goals by tossing an anchor into the unknown.\nCreate a massive goal that acts as the spotlight in the unknown.\nYou don\u2019t set this massive goal for practicality or achievement.\nYou set it for vision, direction, and filtration of opportunities.\nFocus on making it as desirable as possible.\nIf you had all the money in the world, what would your average day look like?\nWhat kind of environment do you want to live in? Is there a specific location? Do you want to travel?\nDo you want a family? What do you want that life to look like? Visualize an average day of family time.\nHow long of a workday do you want to have? If you could do anything, what would you do for work?\nHow do you want to look and feel? Describe your body, energy levels, and how you want to present yourself to the world.\nWhat does your ideal day look like? Map out every hour.\nList out anything else that comes to mind in terms of a specific future that you want to build for yourself.\nTo make this even more potent, turn this vision into an anti-vision to round out the perspective of your ideal self:\nWhat is the bane of your existence?\nWrite out the opposite of every question about your vision.\nFor even more firepower, create a vision board. Add images to a scrapbook, software, or wall that makes that future more tangible.\nRemember that nothing is permanent.\nYou will discover inklings for your vision as you trek along this path. Be open to changing what you want as you discover what you don\u2019t want.\nThe pain of not reaching your vision should outweigh the pleasure of mediocrity.\nNot only does a massive goal provide vision, it allows you a perspective to adopt when it\u2019s time to make a decision.\nFilter every single opportunity you receive through your vision.\nSay \u201cno\u201d to everything except for that which aligns with who you want to become.\nStart short-circuiting the faulty programming your mind runs on through conscious choice.\n2) A Hierarchy Of Goals\nThis is why I created the FOCI Planner:\nMost people don\u2019t need motivation, they need clarity.\nAn ordered mind is a happy one, and a hierarchy of self-generated goals makes it hard for depressing distractions to penetrate your awareness.\nWhile big goals are for vision and filtration, small goals are for practicality and progress.\nNow, break your vision down into goals for each domain of your life \u2013 mind, body, spirit, business. Relationships are synonymous with spirit here.\nYes, this will be time-consuming. Keep this written somewhere safe so you can change things as you go.\nFor all 4 domains of life, create:\n10-year goals\n1-year goals\nMonthly goals\nWeekly goals\nThen, every day, you are going to write down 3-5 priority tasks that move the needle toward these goals from the ground up.\nKnock these tasks out first thing in the morning before responsibilities and distractions have time to wake up.\nI talk about my deep work structure in the letter: Change Your Life In 6 Months (My Deep Work Routine).\n3) How To Learn\nLearning comes from struggle, not memorization.\nYou don\u2019t learn by studying tutorials all day.\nYou learn by building a project and facing reality.\nProjects are goals that you can measure and iterate.\nSo, turn a few of your 1-year or monthly goals into a project.\nIdeate a way to build something tangible (you must do work)\nWrite down milestones you can reach.\nCreate an outline in a notes app or notebook.\nBrain-dump any ideas that come to mind.\nDo this for mental, physical, financial, and spiritual development.\nThis primes your mind for pattern recognition-induced meaningful dopamine.\nYour projects add additional \u201crules\u201d to your perception of situations.\nYou now have a place to write down high-signal information that you receive as you educate yourself and interpret feedback while building.\nStart, then learn. You must learn and build in unison to truly learn.\nWhen you build something, you encounter real problems that require a new level of mind to solve.\nOnly then can you search for information to expand your mind and solve those problems. This is impossible when watching tutorials all day.\n4) Skills Are Groups Of Techniques\nBuilding a project isn\u2019t the end of learning.\nTo build a project, you must acquire skills along the way.\nBut you don\u2019t \u201clearn a skill.\u201d\nYou learn a technique, experiment with it, and continue adding techniques until you can combine them in a way that leads to your desired outcome.\nYou don\u2019t learn Photoshop as a skill.\nYou create a project, search for a technique to complete one aspect of it, and continue learning techniques until you finish the project.\nTrying to learn the software itself is almost useless and takes much longer.\nThere are 10+ different techniques to remove the background of an image.\nKnowing multiple techniques will allow you to remove the background seamlessly from almost any scene.\nYou don\u2019t learn copywriting as a skill.\nYou learn techniques for:\nCapturing attention\nHolding attention\nEnhancing the perceived value of your product or idea\nEtc\nThere are dozens of techniques for each, and the more you learn, the better you get at copywriting as a skill.\nIn 2 Hour Writer, every module is a technique for you to practice becoming a highly paid writer in the new economy.\nEverything is a skill.\nLife is a skill that encapsulates health, wealth, and relationships as skills until broken down into techniques you can practice over the course of your life to master life itself.\nAll skills are mental.\nSkills mental systems that become more efficient with practice to achieve your desired outcome.\n5) Reinvent Yourself\nThink of your mind as the digestive system of reality.\nIf you eat too much or don\u2019t move enough, you won\u2019t metabolize that experience.\nIf you eat too little or move too much, you get hungry and agitated.\nWhen you eat just enough, you create an environment that is conducive to mental muscle growth. You trek through reality toward your goals. You enter a season of pure progress, and the feeling is incredible.\nYou\u2019ve already created the boundaries, limits, or clarity necessary to launch fairly far into the unknown.\nWith a vision, goals, and projects you are primed for an entirely new life.\nAll you have to do is take the leap.\nLaunch yourself into a new physical or digital environment.\nMove across the country.\nUnfollow everyone online.\nFollow people aligned with your future.\nChange what you wear, where you shop, and who you see.\nDrown your mind in the books you\u2019ve been putting off reading.\nAlign all information, or reality, with who you want to become.\nYou will feel threatened at the start until you expand into your new identity.\nYour old identity will die because it is starved of the information that reinforces it.\nHold strong during this extremely difficult yet extremely meaningful turning point in your life.\n6) Nature\u2019s Compass\nPeople are so afraid of making mistakes that they make the biggest mistake of them all: not making mistakes.\nYou can\u2019t avoid making mistakes.\nThey are Nature\u2019s Compass.\nPeople who don\u2019t make mistakes don\u2019t give themselves a chance to achieve successes.\nImagine a self-driving car.\nFor years, it has received negative feedback that refines the system that shapes the mind of the car.\nIt can navigate roads with ease and may be arguably safer than a human driving the car.\nEven though we often don\u2019t think of it like this, the self-driving car made millions if not billions of mistakes before it could actually reach a meaningful destination.\nYou must act in alignment with your big goal to form new systems that your mind operates on through the negative feedback of mistakes.\nMake a habit of forcing yourself to adopt the perspective of the highest version of yourself.\nAllow this lens to unveil new opportunities that you can act on.\nWhen you make a mistake, because you will, use it as direction for your next choice.\nWith time, you won\u2019t even realize that you have become an artist in whatever skill you\u2019ve chosen to develop.\nYou will be able to achieve what most people think are difficult goals like you are able to walk (while most are still crawling).\n7) Self-Experimentation Solves Problems\nYour life and the projects that compose it should be treated as science projects.\nTo solve the problems that achieve your goal:\nHypothesize an outcome (from your goals)\nExperiment with techniques (for skill acquisition)\nDocument the process (as a project)\nDouble down on results (as a solution)\nNow, you have experience, skills, a project you can turn into a business product, and a solution that you can charge money for in the creator economy.\nI discuss this in The Anti-Niche (Why Becoming Nichless Makes You Irreplaceable).\nSelf-experimentation is the only way to solve your problems for good.\nLet\u2019s say you have the goal of achieving a six-pack.\nYou are in search of a solution, they tell you that veganism will solve all of your problems, and from an unenlightened state you:\nClean up your diet\nFollow their advice as if it were law\nSee the results they mentioned\nThen, you attach to that diet ideology and become a prophet. You attribute results, that others have gotten via different modalities, to veganism and demonize anyone that questions you.\nThis is dangerous, obviously, and is the definition of low consciousness.\nIn reality, what happened is independent of veganism:\nYou ate more nutrient-dense foods\nYour actions worked to survive your vegan identity\nYou had clarity (not chaos) by following a disciplined nutrition regimen\nVeganism, in this case, was simply a modality for ordering your mind (sustained degree of flow state) and allowing you to follow the principles of health \u2013 but you attributed it to a method.\nNow, if you were to try veganism for a month, carnivore for a month, keto for a month, and flexible dieting for a month, you would:\nMake connections between the diets to reveal the fundamentals of health (pattern recognition = dopamine).\nPick and choose certain methodologies that you enjoy, meaning they will bring sustainable results.\nRefine a system that fits your individual nature to perfection.\nThen, once healthy living becomes effortless, you can do the same for your finances, social life, romantic relationships, spiritual endeavors, or any other domain of life.\nIf you\u2019re going through problems in your relationship, hire a therapist, watch a YouTube guru, go on a retreat, and experiment with options until you find the right solution.\nIf your business isn\u2019t growing, buy a course, hire a coach, test a new software, zoom out, and create a new strategy.\nThere\u2019s always a way to solve your problems, and you strip yourself of that power when you latch onto one solution (that probably won\u2019t solve the problem for good).\nThink of each domain of your life as both a project and a skill in which you collect techniques to master that domain.\nThe Mastery Method: Summarized\nThis is how you achieve goals so fast people ask for your cheat code in the game of life:\nExpand your mind with a vision generation session. This perspective will allow you to create new goals and discover new potentials for your life (so you can break out of your narrow mind and achieve more).\nCreate a hierarchy of goals to bring clarity to your life. You need to bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be with practical goals.\nTurn your goals into projects so you can build and learn in unison. Projects are goals that are measured, tracked, and improved.\nDon\u2019t learn skills, acquire techniques. Your skill level depends on the amount of techniques in your toolbox that can solve challenging problems.\nReinvent yourself with information overload Change your physical and digital environments to force an open mind and discovery of new potentials.\nTreat mistakes as negative feedback in your system. You have no other way to test something that gets better results.\nTreat your life as a science project. Become obsessed with experimentation in fitness, business, knowledge, and relationships.\nThank you for reading.\nUntil next week,\nDan"

        "content": "I realized this after years of pain.\nExcruciating pain caused by the first piece of advice you\u2019ll hear when you first embark on your journey to become a free individual:\n\u201cNiche down.\u201d\nJust like the social matrix, there is a business matrix.\nThe social matrix is a groundless web of ideas that allows society to operate cohesively.\nThe government and culture influence the school system. The school system creates resources for students to learn from. The students don\u2019t question what they\u2019re taught. The students go on to be parents. The parents teach their children what they know and send them to school. The children make friends and conform further to fit in. The children grow up, get jobs, become teachers, become parents, become politicians, and create the knowledge and resources online and offline that influence culture. The parents, students, and children vote. The cycle continues to create the society we live in.\nThe business matrix is the same web of ideas that allows businesses to operate how they\u2019re \u201csupposed to.\u201d\nYou are a human. You learn by being exposed to beginner-level knowledge, then intermediate and advanced.\nThe thing is, who questioned this beginner-level knowledge from the start?\nAre we absolutely sure it is the best way to go about things?\nIs it the most conducive to results? Or does it cause more confusion that makes people quit too early?\nThose that break free of the matrix can do whatever they want.\nBut you can\u2019t break free in an instant.\nYou have to understand the rules of the game and acquire enough experience before you can start playing your own game.\nIt Never Made Sense. It Never Worked. Until\u2026\nWhen I began my business journey I started with freelancing.\nI thought it was the most \u201cbeginner-friendly\u201d option because all I had to do was \u201clearn a skill, sell a skill.\u201d\nSo, I decided to try my hand at freelancing with almost every skill you can think.\nVideo editing, graphic design, SEO, content marketing, Facebook Ads, and web design.\nI called myself an \u201cagency\u201d at the time because it sounded cooler than being a freelancer. But it was just me. So I wasn\u2019t an agency, I was a freelancer. So are you if you don\u2019t have employees.\n(People don\u2019t care about whether you are an agency or freelancer by the way).\nMy pain point was always picking a niche.\nI\u2019d download free guides and run endless Google searches on the \u201ctop 100 niches to target.\u201d\nI targeted dentists, gyms, construction companies, and the rest.\nWhat are the problems with this approach?\nI don\u2019t care about these people. I would (and did) hate working with them. This isn\u2019t a sustainable approach to something as important as your life\u2019s work. You\u2019re starting a business for a reason, and it isn\u2019t to just have a new boss.\nI don\u2019t have experience with their business. Most businesses fail because they try to solve a problem they haven\u2019t experienced. Remember that. Feel free to come back to me when you ignore this and fail.\nIt prioritizes finding, not attracting or becoming. You learn a skill for someone else. You search endlessly for people to reach out to and end up spending more time on lead generation than building leverage.\nIt\u2019s no wonder people don\u2019t stick to building a business.\nThe business ideologies circling the space have dominated for too long.\nThey are shallow and lack regard for human nature, psychology, and fulfillment.\nI will give you a better way to go about creating a niche of one. A way that is intuitive, profitable, and sustainable.\nA few lessons that will spare you a lot of pain:\n1) The strong desire to find the best niche is a blatant sign pointing to the fact that you don\u2019t understand business from a big picture. Principles VS tactics, and \u201cfinding the best niche\u201d is a tactic.\n2) Build a product or service that you would actually buy, use, and benefit from. There aren\u2019t many shortcuts in business, but this is one of them.\nThose two lessons are what changed everything for me.\nThe Most Profitable Niche Is You (Productize Your Mind)\nMost people don\u2019t realize that they belong to a very specific niche.\nYou follow a broad amount of people with various interests that have created who you are.\nThis is mistake number one when creating your niche:\nIf your job is to target a specific person, and you are a specific person, why are you narrowing in on one specific interest that you want to sell a product or service around?\nNo, it won\u2019t make you more authoritative.\nNo, people won\u2019t trust you more.\nAt best, you\u2019ll look like a glorified search engine of \u201cactionable advice.\u201d\nAt worst, you limit your audience growth and can\u2019t leverage a wider network.\nIf someone only talked about the niche they chose, like training programs for entrepreneurs and executives, they would only attract those people.\nThis isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s such a small sample size, and this isn\u2019t paid ads where you can pinpoint ad placements to get in front of these people.\nWhen they only talk to that niche:\nThey have more difficulty at the start.\nFewer people share their content (they can\u2019t get in front of the right people)\nThey may grow to 5,000 followers in a year when someone who incorporated their interests can grow to 20,000 in a year\nAfter 3 years, the first gets to 30,000 and the second gets to 300,000 because of the compounding effect.\n\u201cBut Dan, those 300,000 followers don\u2019t care about my product or service. They\u2019re not hot leads. They aren\u2019t going to buy from me right away. They\u2019re useless.\u201d\nThere is a lot to unpack there.\nFirst, if those 300,000 followers each know 3-5 people that they can refer to you, that\u2019s a 900,000 to 1,500,000 audience thanks to the network effect. All while the 30,000 follower hyper-niched-down guy is struggling to have enough leverage to get out of manual client work.\nSecond, they\u2019re not supposed to buy from you right away. That\u2019s the entire purpose of an education brand. You help them go from beginner (content) to advanced (product) with time.\nThird, nobody is a useless follower, you are just so narrow-minded and indoctrinated with outdated business dogma that you don\u2019t understand that people can learn something new that improves their life.\nBy the way, I teach all of this in Digital Economics.\nA \u201cNiche\u201d Is A Worldview or Perspective\nLet\u2019s break down what a niche actually is.\nWhen you are the niche, and who you are is constantly changing, you are niche-less.\nYou don\u2019t box yourself into skills or interests that you will outgrow because you are human.\nWhy are you told to niche down in the first place?\nSo you can understand the mind of your readers and customers.\nYou\u2019re told to create a customer avatar, identify a burning problem they face, and position a solution toward them. (This solution is often the same as any other product with small changes. The point is to make it perceived as valuable to a specific person by understanding them. Hack: recreate what already exists, but better, and don\u2019t overcomplicate it).\nSo, why don\u2019t we skip all of that and treat ourselves as the customer avatar, solve problems that we\u2019ve actually experienced, and build a solution that actually benefits our lives.\nThis eliminates 99% of the guesswork with making money.\nAnd, you don\u2019t end up working with people you don\u2019t like.\nIn essence, a customer avatar is the mind, worldview, or perspective of someone you are creating for or marketing toward.\nFrom a structural standpoint, a worldview or perspective is composed of:\n1) Goals\nThe conscious or unconscious goals that influence every single action you take, like taking one step forward or going to the gym.\nSelf-generated goals put you in control of your life.\nGoals frame how you interpret situations. A person with the assigned goal of society to retire at 60 years old will see fewer business opportunities as opportunities than the person with a self-generated goal of financial freedom by 25 years old.\nGoals also frame how you (or your readers) interpret books and content. Two people with different goals will have radically different highlights of the books and content. They will notice the things that aid in their goals \u2013 whether they are aware of it or not.\n2) Problems\nThe conscious or unconscious problems that prevent you from reaching your goals or ideal lifestyle.\nThe foundation of marketing is to raise your readers\u2019 level of awareness surrounding their problems over time.\nIf you\u2019ve solved your own problems and are helping your audience do the same, you are in a great position.\nThe 5 levels of awareness are:\nUnaware \u2013 unaware of their problem and how it is hurting their quality of life.\nProblem aware \u2013 aware of their problem but don\u2019t know how to solve it.\nSolution aware \u2013 aware of their problem and know there is a solution, education, or knowledge to solve it.\nProduct aware \u2013 aware of their problem and know there is a streamlined path or system to solve it.\nMost aware \u2013 they are ready to change, they just need the right \u201cwhy\u201d that changes behavior instantly. Like when you read an idea in the book and it changes you entire outlook on life.\nWhen your worldview is your niche, your job is to write in a creative fashion that increases people\u2019s awareness of their problems. That way, they act on a solution toward reaching their goals.\n3) Potential paths\nThe last piece of the worldview puzzle is clarity.\nWhen people don\u2019t have clarity on their next steps, they feel anxious, overwhelmed, or bored.\nThis is what causes arguments in relationships, dissonance in business, and battles between political parties.\nPeople who don\u2019t share the same worldview are missing pieces of the other party\u2019s path, narrative, or system that allows them to make sense of that situation.\nSo, when you are the niche, your job is to create a holistic, step-by-step path that you can share with readers who have your same worldview, usually in the form of a product or service that you can be paid for.\nThat way they are more likely to get results and understand you.\nThere\u2019s a reason why my philosophical musings bring a load of new people into business. Because I make it make more sense than the shallow business gurus you see everywhere.\nBeyond goals, problems, and potential paths there are multiple aspects of the human psyche that influence how people perceive and act on goals and problems:\nPrior experiences\nFirm and loose beliefs\nSkill level across all domains of life\nAll of the above can be conscious, unconscious, known, or unknown.\nYour entire job as an education brand is to raise the consciousness of your audience.\nMake them conscious of their goals and problems.\nExpose them to unknown potentials of their life and educate them to the point of it being known.\nYour niche is the frame of big goals and burning problems that compose your worldview.\nYour job is to program the minds of your audience to adopt this frame (or worldview), pursue those goals, and solve those problems.\nThis is a massive yet fulfilling undertaking to live a life of purpose.\nIt demands that you develop yourself for life and evolve with the responsibility of guiding a community under you.\nNiches are supposed to be specific, and what is more specific than this?\nA desirable goal that will change your life (and your readers).\nA burning problem that will ease your suffering (and your readers).\nA clear path, system, or solution to bring you clarity (and your readers).\nThe goals and problems will almost always be similar to someone else\u2019s.\nEveryone has the same goals and problems in the eternal markets: health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nBut the path\u2026\nThe path is singular to you.\nEveryone wants financial freedom, but two people have to take different paths.\nYou may go the social media and online business route with e-commerce and the unique skills, mindset, and experience associated with that.\nAnother may go the investing and real estate route with another unique combination of skills and interests.\nRemember that every other interest you learn also plays a role in how you perceive situations.\nIf journaling, going on a walk, or playing video games were included on that path, no matter how direct to achieving your goal, still played a role in your achieving your goal.\nThe path is what creates who you are.\nAll of the beliefs, skills, and billions of bits of information you process along the way toward achieving your goals is the most unique niche in the world.\nIf you can illustrate your path across your hundreds of posts, newsletters, products, and interactions \u2013 that is how you create a niche of one.\nYour job is to document your life on the internet and let the rewards of authenticity work their magic.\nYour job is to attract a specific group of people. You do this by writing ideas in a way that makes sense to you. From your worldview. From your point of view. The specific group of people are those with your same personality. That\u2019s how you set yourself up to create a product for yourself that sells without market research.\nThe Book Of Your Life \u2013 How To Create Your Niche Of One\nWhen you document your life on the internet, you create your niche of one.\nThe mindset & skillset of your past, present, and future self should be illustrated in a persuasive manner to attract those with a similar personality, but are a few steps behind you so you can actually help them.\nYou are going to outline the structure of a book you would write about your life.\nThis will be used for pattern recognition and content creation.\nUse this outline to notice ideas as you consume information.\nAlso use it as a content plan to write newsletters, threads / carousels, and short form posts over the course of 6-12 months (that is how long it will take to get your audience truly familiar with you).\nWith that, fill out the book structure below as if you were writing to those 1-3 steps behind you.\nYou can use this book outline along with my 2 Hour Writer course to write content that actually leads to readership growth.\nBook Introduction: Your Story\nYour story is your brand. It is important that you get clear on what your story is so you can use it to frame content from a unique angle.\nYou can start almost any writing with a personal experience. That alone makes it unique and not like the rest of shallow writing.\nWhere did you start out?\nWhat struggles did you go through?\nWhat was the climax of your journey?\nWhat did you achieve that is desirable to others?\nWhat topics, interests, or skills helped you get there?\nSection 1: Philosophy\nYou need to get people on the same page as you.\nYour philosophy is your answer to the question, \u201cHow does one live the good life?\u201d\nYou must constantly illustrate the importance of what you believe and do in a way that leads toward your ideal future (or avoids the \u201cenemy\u201d of your brand).\nDescribe your ideal future and lifestyle in detail. What goals are you leading your followers toward?\nDescribe the enemy. What is the future and lifestyle you want to avoid like the plague?\nWhat are beliefs you have that others would consider extreme or offensive?\nWhat is the importance of each topic, interest, or skill you\u2019ve learned to help you on the way toward your ideal lifestyle?\nTake your time with this. The outline will be pretty dang big.\nThe answers to these questions will form the majority of your content ideas that lead to a lot of growth.\nSection 2: Education\nThis is how you build authority.\nYour job is to educate people on the skills or interests\nLiterally teach them the skill or interest and how you learned it. There is only so much that can be said about this. You aren\u2019t creating anything new. You are simply creating a library of information under your brand \u2013 that way people can learn from you.\nDon\u2019t fall into the trap of, \u201cThey can just learn this information somewhere else online.\u201d\nAssume they don\u2019t have the drive to learn elsewhere and that YOU have to give them the information.\nAs we will discuss in the next section, people remember those who first taught them the knowledge that is useful to them. Be that person for more people.\nSection 3: Practice\nCreate step-by-step systems and practices that your readers can use to get better at your skills and interests.\nAs a bonus, slap your own name on these.\nIf you want to recreate something like The Eisenhower Matrix for productivity, do it.\nDon\u2019t teach that concept or model, take it and create your own in a way that may get better results.\nBehavior change is the driver of authority and recognition.\nWhen you write your book with time on social media, you build a brand that blows past 99% of people.\nThe Psychology Of Interest \u2013 How To Talk About Whatever You Want & Still Get Paid\nSince I\u2019ve started changing the online business landscape, I get this question almost daily:\n\u201cI want to talk about more of my interests, but what if it gets low engagement or my audience doesn\u2019t like it?\u201d\nFirst, understand the separation between content and product.\nPeople think that content is all about promotions. They think they should only write content that leads to sales and leads.\nThey think they should niche down everything they write about \u2013 rather than having a specific and compelling landing page for a product that establishes authority in one go so you don\u2019t have to talk about it all the time in your content.\nTest ideas here and there for selling your product in your content, then use those ideas to form the landing page that lives as static content forever that you link to.\nI see this way too often:\nAll people post are images or updates of their product.\nOr they make a post with\nThey never show that they are human.\nThey never educate, entertain, or inspire (you know, the things that people actually follow and show up for on social media).\nThey only sell.\nNobody follows company accounts.\nPeople follow educators, entertainers, and inspirers.\nRedBull has a massive following because they don\u2019t have a single picture of their product on their Instagram. It is all inspirational content about the lifestyle people are living because of RedBull.\nIf all you do is talk about your product, that is a great way to never grow your brand, have engaged readers, or see exponential growth in revenue.\nA personal brand is the most potent traffic source for your business, product, or service.\nSo, let\u2019s start by flipping this on its head.\nWhat happens if you only talk about your skill that makes you money?\nYou get low engagement. If your content doesn\u2019t get shared, how are you going to grow so that you have more people to promote to?\nYou don\u2019t build trust or authority. Stop thinking like you have to monetize right now and start thinking that you\u2019re going to monetize in 12 months (and you\u2019ll monetize faster now by doing so.)\nPeople don\u2019t like you. If you ever want to pivot and sell something else, you won\u2019t be able to. You\u2019re trapped into whatever niche you always sell to.\nPeople have multiple interests.\nPeople can adopt new interests.\nYou can make your interests interesting so people become interested in them.\nThis is what turns viewers into fans into superfans.\nSomeone may follow you for one interest, like how you would follow Dwayne The Rock Johnson after watching a movie he starred in.\nNow they\u2019re a viewer.\nThen you either share another interest of theirs or get introduced to something new, like how The Rock posts about fitness and nutrition.\nNow they\u2019re a fan.\nThen they discover the beliefs or values that compose their mindset, like how The Rock values gratitude and hard work.\nNow they\u2019re a superfan.\n(Everyone should include mindset in their content by the way, that is what attracts a broad audience because it applies to everyone).\nTalking about more than one interest is how you become irreplaceable.\nThe best personal brands do this without trying.\nThey just post whatever they deem important to them and attempt to illustrate that importance to you.\nHere\u2019s how you can begin doing this:\n1) Focus On Education\nAdopt the mind of your past self, an absolute beginner.\nHow would they get to where you are now in a better way?\n2) Focus On Understanding\nZoom out and identify the gaps in your followers\u2019 knowledge.\nWhat do they need to know to get on the same page as you?\n3) Focus On Importance\nAnalyze your life and realize why you do what you do.\nWhy do you only have those select skills and beliefs rather than the millions of others you could have? Why did you take the path you did over another one?\nBroad Brand, Specific Product (How To Actually Niche Down)\nYou may be asking, \u201cDan, how am I going to sell anything if I\u2019m not writing anything related to what I sell?\u201d\nFirst, you are writing about it occasionally so people know what you do.\nTwo, you don\u2019t have a solid understanding of what marketing actually is.\nYou are almost never directly talking about the skill you sell.\nYou are talking about how it will change their life. How it will spark a transformation. How it will bridge the gap between where they are and their ideal future.\nYou are illustrating the life they want, making them aware of the problem they are facing, and presenting a product as the solution.\nWith that, think about niching down like this:\nYour brand is a broad attractor of similar people.\nYour content is a modality of making people aware of desirable goals and burning problems in their life.\nYour first and foundational product is the bridge between those.\nYou don\u2019t have to consistently write about your product because you have something called a landing page that picks up where your content left off. A landing page is static digital real estate that doesn\u2019t disappear like content does.\nSo, become a mad scientist for a bit.\nMap out a newsletter, free guide, low-ticket product, and high-ticket service (which is optional if you are building a large, not niche, audience).\nYour newsletters should all be hosted on a blog so you can plug the best ones for interested readers to read.\nYour free guide landing page and content educates people toward becoming customers for your product. This is catered toward a more specific problem in your audience.\nYour product landing page picks up from where you left off and makes people aware that they can solve their problem faster.\nThat is how you niche down.\nYou deploy digital real estate, write worldview-based content, and consistently guide people every day toward your newsletter, free guide, and product in that order.\nThe Evolution Of Your Niche, Brand, and Products\nSolve your own problems and sell the solution.\nNot once, but forever.\nYour brand, content, and products will evolve as you reach new heights in your life.\nYou will be forced to create new products as the old ones lose their punch. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, it actually allows you to sustain and increase your yearly revenue.\nI have launched something new almost every quarter since I started 4 years ago.\nFrom web design and freelancing, to marketing consulting, to a physical productivity planner, to social media growth, to self-improvement, to writing, to a business masterclass, to short cohorts, to a book, and now a software from the systems I\u2019ve created (that almost nobody can replicate because their path isn\u2019t the same).\nYou have to experiment and iterate.\nThat is the only way you will prevent brand entropy and not die a slow death to the nature of social media. You must evolve.\nThat\u2019s it for this letter.\nHope it helped.\nDan"

        "content": "Everyone wants to be a content creator.\nThis isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nEspecially if you can predict where the future of work is going.\nBoomers will tell you to \u201cget a real job,\u201d when those real jobs won\u2019t exist in a few decades.\nThey don\u2019t realize that the Industrial Age created those jobs.\nThey also don\u2019t realize that the Information Age has created these new, more profitable jobs.\nProfitability determines the direction of society and the economy.\nTechnology allows for more profitable lines of work.\nThe creator economy is projected to double in size from $250B to $480B over the next 5 years.\nThe big problem is a lack of understanding.\nPeople don\u2019t understand what the content creation is from a big-picture point of view.\nThere\u2019s a reason everyone feels the pull to become a content creator.\nBecause it\u2019s human.\nBecause people want to do what they want.\nBecause people have an innate drive to pursue their curiosity, become a vessel for value, and create with their own two hands. You know, the things that schools and jobs stripped from you.\nBecause when you peel back the layers, that\u2019s what the natural evolution of humanity has been pointing at this entire time.\nSince the dawn of time, we\u2019ve been solving problems with technology to rid ourselves of robotic and time-consuming labor work so we can pursue self-actualization and transcendence.\nLet\u2019s define what both content and creation are.\nContent:\nThe things that are held or included in something.\nIn other words, everything is content.\nContent is structured information.\nInformation is how we learn, grow, and adapt as a species. Information is what occupies our mind, shapes our mind, and comes out of our mind. We use the structure of our psyche to create content.\nThe front end of the internet is content.\nThe front end of your mind is content.\nThe back end of the internet is code.\nThe back end of your mind is code.\nCreation:\nTo bring into existence.\nThat\u2019s what humans do.\nThey create. They solve problems. They build solutions. That is your edge.\nTo be human is to expand, transcend, and create.\nTo be robot is to forget that you have this gift and allow your mind to mold to the whims of others with schooling and employment.\nAt its root, content creation is just being a human, not a robot as outdated jobs would have you believe.\nEveryone is a content creator. Some just choose to do it with intention, and get paid to do so, in a place called the internet where physical boundaries don\u2019t limit your reach and potential.\nContent creation is how you make your writing and speaking more valuable, because you must first become valuable enough as an individual to contribute to (and profit from) the global digital community like our ancestors did their local physical community.\nBefore we begin:\nThe Koe Black Friday sale is on.\nUp to 50% off my courses and products.\nI organized everything on its own page for you.\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting to grab something from me, now\u2019s your time.\nTake advantage of me conforming to a useless holiday before Monday at midnight.\nContent Creation Is Not A Job Or Business \u2013 It Is A Magnet\nLet\u2019s bring things back down to Earth (even though it\u2019s not as fun and loses its zest).\nIn business, you need 2 things to make money:\nPeople \u2013 business is value exchange, and if you want money, you need someone else to give it to you in exchange for something of equal value.\nProduct \u2013 a product (services included) is a valuable creation, physical or digital, that preferably solves a real problem in somebody\u2019s life.\nThere is more nuance to this of course like understanding how to market the product to the people you attract, but you absolutely need people and a product. That isn\u2019t optional.\nSo, that\u2019s the first thing we need to understand:\nContent is how you attract people to your product as a creator.\nHow do you create content that attracts people?\nBy deconstructing your mind and sharing its best parts on the internet.\nMost people struggle when they begin writing because they water down everything they say, or they try to overcomplicate it.\nHere\u2019s exactly what you need to write content that attracts people like you:\n1) Relatable Topics\nBeing a content creator is still new.\nPeople are still applying old and outdated business and marketing tactics in hopes that their audience will grow large.\nNiching down the topics you talk about \u201cBut Dan, the riches are in the niches!!! It\u2019s a fact!\u201d\nI get it, but people misinterpret what that means.\nAnd, what if I decide I want to build a massive audience and create a niche?\nIf they made the same amount of money, I would rather have a 3 million follower audience than a 10,000 follower audience.\nThe former gives you an obscene amount of unseen leverage, flexibility, and options.\nThe latter is probably 3 clients away from feeling like their survival is at stake.\nSo, write broad in your content and narrow down to your expertise across your content funnel.\nYour top-of-funnel social media accounts should include topics that people are actively searching for a studying like productivity, psychology, mindset, freelancing, skill acquisition, business, marketing, etc.\nPeople actually want to follow and learn about those things.\nDon\u2019t get all crazy with \u201cautomated response mechanisms for e-commerce stores.\u201d\nEducate people from your social media to newsletter to podcast and let your product page be the final piece to prove your authority and niche down as far as you want to go.\nThis strategy will require you to have a series of products ranging from beginner to advanced.\nIf you only have plans to sell a super specific high-ticket service, this isn\u2019t for you.\n2) Impactful Ideas\nYour posts, sentences, paragraphs, or anything you write will not hit if you do not pick a side.\nIf you stand in the middle, people may like you, but you won\u2019t impact them.\nImpact = writing words so powerful that they live in their head rent-free. It occupies their attention even when their attention is off of your content. They tell their friends and co-workers about your ideas because they want to strengthen the shared extreme beliefs they have to feel validated.\nYou write with impact when you wholeheartedly pick a side and express your beliefs.\nWhat are the best beliefs to express?\nThe ones that the average person would think are \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201ccrazy.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t want people who are dedicated to being average following us.\nYour beliefs form the foundation and perception of your brand.\nTalk about them often and use them as a way to provide perspective, experience, and examples in most of your content.\nDo you think freelancing is the best beginner way to make money?\nDo you think vegans are dumb and people should eat more animal-based foods?\nDo you think people should wake up at 3am and get straight into work?\nYour goal is to be 90% liked 10% disliked.\nIf you don\u2019t maintain that polarity with your audience (like you would in a thriving relationship) you give people no reason to care about you.\nYou need the push-pull.\nThis isn\u2019t writing advice, this is spiritual advice.\nMake your writing raw, punchy, and digestible.\nRemove and replace words that make you sound less confident.\nWrite with impact, but be open to changing your mind when somebody presents you with a better perspective in the replies.\nHave firm beliefs held loosely.\n3) Novel Perspectives\nMost people regurgitate the same ideas.\nThey never provide a new way of looking at things.\nNovel perspectives are the main way to provide a \u201cgood\u201d dopamine hit that aids in learning, understanding, and action.\nMost creators dish out cheap dopamine-like candy in hopes that they will build a loyal readership.\nYou create novel perspectives through hunting in the unknown.\nYou hunt in the unknown through personal experience (pursuing your own goals and self-reflection) and researching information in the depths of books, podcasts, articles, and social media accounts.\nPeople don\u2019t want just another idea, they want a unique point of view.\nLike the intro of this letter.\nI had to stop and think about the idea I wanted to convey and pair personal experience with philosophical ideas that shaped my worldview.\nTake your topics, beliefs, and novel perspectives you acquire over time to craft writing that holds attention without annoying tactics.\n4) Writing Structure\nYou can have the greatest ideas in the world, but you have to pay attention to where you are posting them.\nWhen people read a book, they are okay with blocks of text.\nWhen people are on social media, they need to be guided throughout your writing (or else they will scroll past to the next person that catches their attention).\nUse line breaks.\nGo and look at any of my posts and notice how I add line breaks between sentences to increase readability.\nStudy high-performing structures.\nLook at popular X posts, IG posts, YouTube titles, and article headlines.\nWrite more lists.\nBullet lists open a curiosity loop.\nPeople can like, share, follow, or comment based on any bullet in your list.\nLists force you to condense each bullet to be impactful. People will add their own thoughts or nuance in the comments (boosting reach) because of this.\nAnything can be turned into a list.\nGo hunt for an idea and try to turn it into a list of reasons, benefits, pains, or steps. I need to post in an hour from now, so I\u2019m going to find an idea real quick.\nOkay I\u2019m back, the idea is: 10 habits that changed my life from a Medium article headline.\nHere\u2019s the post I wrote for X:\nHow to clear your mind: Walk more. Read more. Write more. Listen more. Lift more. Strategize more. Build more. Scroll less. Indulge less. Criticize less. Ruminate less. Sit less. Procrastinate less. Clarity is reserved for those who don\u2019t resist reality, but engage with it.\nI could have put all of those as bullet points, but it wouldn\u2019t have fit on the post if I repurpose it to all platforms.\nHook > body > conclusion.\n5) Eyes & Effort\nMost creators make the massive mistake of caring about the algorithm and the latest trends.\nThey lack understanding of what the algorithm is based on: human nature, psychology, and mechanics.\nThe principles of each:\nDesired outcome.\nBurning problem.\nA clear solution or system.\nWhen you can nail each one of those in your content, people will share it.\nIf they don\u2019t, then you aren\u2019t as good of a writer as you think you are. You need more data, testing, and experimentation with your writing.\nBeyond that, creators realize that the algorithm will get people to see their content so they can grow, but don\u2019t realize they can control the amount of people that see their content.\nYou have to put effort into your growth, especially as a beginner, by replying to larger accounts (that have an audience to see your replies and follow you), networking with creators to help each other, and potentially paying for help.\nI break all of these down in How To Actually Grow On Social Media (Even If You Have 0 Followers).\nYou Need A Product YOU Would Actually Buy & Use\nWithout lying to yourself, create a product that you would actually buy, use, and benefit from. There aren\u2019t many shortcuts in business, but this is one of them.\nWhen you are the niche, you don\u2019t need to excessively worry about market research, product market fit, or crafting the perfect marketing strategy.\nBuilding an audience is a modern cheat code.\nYour content is how you test ideas that will turn into your marketing. You already know that it works.\nAbout a year ago, I wrote a thread on X that broke down how I write articles and newsletters in a way that can be repurposed into content across all platforms.\nIt did very well, so I turned it into my 2-Hour Writer course.\nYour audience is more trusting of you since they\u2019ve been exposed to a lot of your content. You don\u2019t need to have the perfect conversion-centered landing page and copywriting because people already know if they are going to buy.\nYou\u2019ve raised their level of awareness around their problems over time with your content. Your landing or sales page for your product is just the final kicker that provides clarity.\nWhen I was a freelancer relying on cold DMs, cold emails, and referrals \u2013 I was neurotic about having the most optimized website copywriting that would convert.\nEvery time I sent an email it felt like I had to make the most of it.\nI didn\u2019t have any breathing room.\nThere are 2 routes that people tell you to go.\nOne is to wait until you hit a large enough readership to monetize.\nTwo is to monetize immediately.\nThe first option is for those who have a stable income and have already developed a skillset.\nThe second option is for those who are using social media as their vessel to create an independent income source and develop their skill set.\nI\u2019m tired of hearing people say, \u201cBuild a business off social media, then build an audience and monetize.\u201d\nNo more gatekeeping.\nIt didn\u2019t used to be this way, but social media is a viable way to start a business.\nIn fact, it\u2019s probably the most effective path you can take.\nIf you\u2019re an absolute beginner, use The Build Teach Earn Method:\nThe Build Teach Earn Method For Digital Success\nI had quite a few skills and freelancing business under my belt before starting as a creator.\nThis method helped me succeed much faster.\nIt bakes in every single thing you need to earn a living as a creator.\n1) Build To Learn High-Value Skills To Earn With\nThe best way to learn is to self-educate (so you have knowledge) as you build something tangible (so you have experience).\nFew content creators realize that most businesses are the same nowadays.\nThey acquire customers online with a brand, content, product, and promotions.\nMeaning:\nIf you learn the skills that make your creator business a success, you can use those skills to offer other businesses in the form of a freelance service or digital product.\nEvery single skill it takes to build a creator business is a high-value skill that everyone is talking about.\nLearn graphic design as you build your profile picture, banner, website images, thumbnails, etc.\nLearn copywriting and content writing as you build your landing pages, website, social media content, and newsletters.\nLearn social media (yes, it\u2019s a skill) to build your following, network, and authority.\nLearn marketing and sales as you build your product or service.\nLearn advertising and promotions as you promote your products or services to get buyers.\nThere\u2019s more to this, but every single business (at least the ones we care about that will be profitable in the future) depends on:\nTop-of-funnel \u2013 social media platforms like X, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.\nMiddle-of-funnel \u2013 newsletter, lead magnets, direct messages, and any other way of nurturing your readers.\nBottom-of-funnel\u2013 products, services, upsells, downsells, etc.\nI would encourage you to slowly learn every single skill that will enhance your success as a creator.\nStart with writing.\nThat is what generates the most traffic and followers.\nYou can improve by practicing what we talked about above or in previous letters, or you can skip the trial and error and grab 2 Hour Writer.\nWhen you have traffic and followers, you can actually sell your products and services.\nOr, you can charge high prices to other businesses because their main problem is traffic and leads.\n2) Teach To Enhance Your Learning & Build An Audience\nThe second best way to learn is to teach what you know, what you\u2019re learning, and what you\u2019ve done to achieve a profitable or meaningful goal.\nWhen you teach something, you will struggle\u2026 a lot.\nPeople struggle to teach and start to think, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\nCorrect, you aren\u2019t. Neither is anyone else.\nStruggling to teach is an opportunity to self-educate on the specific information that will fill your knowledge gap.\nTo write content:\nTeach your skillset\nTeach your mindset\nTry to make sense of complex ideas from your point of view\nTeach about your polarizing beliefs like \u201ceveryone should be a carnivore\u201d and why\nNot only does teaching build authority, but it turns you into a value creator.\nIf \u201cvalue\u201d equals positive behavior change, then most creators aren\u2019t valuable.\nWhen you start a micro education business disguised as a content creator, you set yourself up for hyper-profitability.\n3) Earn By Helping Others With What You\u2019ve Learned\nBy this point, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve built a valuable social media account to 5-10,000 followers.\nYou are fully qualified to charge others for help with your skillset.\nMost people don\u2019t have those results.\nI\u2019m not just talking about growing a following. I\u2019m talking about everything that led to it.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve learned:\nContent writing\nThread writing\nProfile design\nEmail opt-in pages\nNewsletter writing\nI\u2019ve literally seen people in the past week making money selling consulting and courses for how to create long-form X posts (and they have been making good money relative to their account size).\nAt this point, start small.\nDon\u2019t try to create some insane offer that you can charge $10-$20K for.\nFigure out what area you have become best at and don\u2019t overcomplicate it.\nIf you\u2019ve gotten results with threads or long-form posts \u2013 create and product or service around that.\nIf you\u2019re great at profile and content design \u2013 create a product or service around that.\nIf your focus is off the charts with your productivity system \u2013 create a product or service around that.\nIf you\u2019ve done it, and it helped your business, that means it can help someone else who struggles in that area.\nSolve your own problems and sell the solution.\nThis is when you start heavily absorbing knowledge around copywriting, marketing, and sales.\nThose skills will only enhance your ability to sell.\nBut realize that skill acquisition is actually technique acquisition.\nYou get better at social media by experimenting with techniques like thread writing, post structures, mastermind groups, etc until you learn how to get results.\nRight now, sell the technique, not the skill.\n3.5) An Equally Viable Route\nBusiness and marketing products and services sell well.\nThey are very beginner-friendly.\nAnd eventually, you will need those skills no matter what you sell.\nSo, if you are just starting out in life and don\u2019t have any other skills or interests, do what I just told you to do in step 3.\nYou can (and should) create a product or service to launch and sell at least every quarter (3 months) for 2-3 years.\nDon\u2019t take that lightly.\nYes, it\u2019s a lot.\nBut that\u2019s the exact and only difference I can see between myself and others who make 1/10 the amount that have been doing this for the same amount of time.\nBuilding forces you to evolve and learn.\nCreating a new product isn\u2019t just creating a new product.\nIt\u2019s creating a new identity with the skillset and mindset you must acquire to build the product, sell the product, and improve the product.\nBusiness growth is a vessel for personal growth.\nThe other route you can take is by creating a product or service that you would buy, use, and benefit from.\nA business principle that most people glance over is \u201csell what\u2019s already selling.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t try to create new markets just yet.\nYou stick your hands in the ones that are already flowing.\nWhat products have you bought recently?\nWhich ones do you use daily?\nWhat courses have you taken and gotten your own results from?\nWhen I started out on social media, I created and sold a web design and freelancing product.\nWhy? Because I purchased 5-10 web design and freelancing courses myself.\nI knew they sold. I didn\u2019t opt for the silly belief that the market is saturated.\nAnd, I had results freelancing.\nAs I grew, I created the Power Planner.\nWhy? Because I used planners all the time and always wished there was something else inside it.\nI also enjoyed talking about productivity in my content.\nI break down how to create a minimum viable offer (product or service) in The Best Online Business To Make $1 Million In 2023.\n4) Earn More By Leveraging Your Results & Audience\nAlright, we\u2019re all over the place now.\nAt this point, you have:\nA high-value skill stack (ability to solve profitable problems)\nA growing audience or readership (people that have profitable problems)\nExperience with building and selling (better at solving profitable problems)\nYou are in one of the most optimal positions you can be in this Digital Renaissance.\nYou have the resources to be an independent thinker and earner.\nYou don\u2019t have to conform to government agendas you hate.\nYou don\u2019t have to report to someone for work that was assigned to you.\nFrom this place of newfound experience, you want to productize your results.\nIf you\u2019ve helped people with freelancing or consulting:\nWrite down the exact steps that led to you getting results.\nIf you don\u2019t have steps, create them now and refine as you go.\nThese steps are your unique mechanism. This is your way of marketing a solution to solve a problem in someone\u2019s life to reach the desired outcome they want.\nWrite down the desired outcome of their life (what is their vision for the future?) You are selling a better life.\nWrite down the worst outcome of their life (what is their anti-vision for the future?) You are helping them avoid pain.\nThat is your marketing strategy.\nOn your landing page, start by writing out their anti-vision in detail.\nThen, talk about the vision they could achieve.\nLast, present your solution as a way to bridge the gap.\nEmulate other landing pages to understand headlines, content structure, and use it as training wheels for your first.\nAs you grow a readership, it doesn\u2019t make sense to focus on low-leverage activities like client work.\nAnd if you don\u2019t plan to hire a team just yet and dive into management \u2013 the logical option is to create a digital product that requires minimal effort with high-profit margins.\nThis is how some solopreneurs make millions.\nThey understand that if they can gain 1 follower, they can gain 1 million.\nAnd if they have a product that doesn\u2019t require labor to fulfill, they can turn those 1 million eyes into multiple millions of dollars.\nI hope you enjoyed this one.\nUntil next week,\nDan"

        "content": "When I was young, I made a crucial observation.\nI had to earn with my mind, not my time.\nI made the distinction between labor workers and creative workers.\nLabor workers would try to accomplish as much as their bodies could handle within a specific time frame.\nCreative workers would focus on solving the problems that would lead to the most results, regardless of time spent.\nLabor workers were locked into a salary and schedule that paid them a certain amount of money for their efforts.\nCreative workers created their own salary and schedule that paid them according to the level of problem they solved.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with labor work.\nBut understand that you are trading time for money.\nAnd your time is limited.\nDoctors can be paid a great salary, but they are paid the same whether they save someone\u2019s life or tell them to take some aspirin.\nA writer can be paid as much as they want depending on what they write, what their product is, and how far their writing spreads.\nWriting is one example here as we will discuss how to monetize anything you wish later in this letter.\nThe difference between creative workers and labor workers is owning a business.\nBusiness is about solving a series of creative problems until you create the income and lifestyle you desire.\nAs soon as you stop solving creative problems around product and reach, your income stagnates and you become a slave to the work you built yourself into.\nMy Evolution From Time To Mind\nWhen I first started in business, the logical option was to freelance with a valuable skill.\nIt seemed beginner-friendly and cost zero dollars to start.\nWith years of manual effort, the joy that came from building the business slowly fell as my responsibilities rose.\nI could only take on a specific amount of clients.\nI only had so much time in the day.\nUnless I wanted to stay in a self-made 9-5, I had to get creative. I had to evolve.\nCreativity is dependent on the expansion of your mind.\nSo, through education and exposing myself to the unknown, I registered new opportunities to solve my problem.\nI began writing online to attract new clients.\nThis removed the time-suck of manually reaching out to potential clients with cold email, cold call, and and cold messages.\nI built a digital product that could sell while I sleep.\nThis removed my absolute dependence on client work to survive.\nI pivoted my freelance offer into a consulting offer.\nThis cut my client work times in half. I could charge more and do less because I was helping someone rather than doing it for them.\nDuring this time, I made a discovery that changed the direction of my life:\nIf I could gain one reader, I could gain one million.\nAnd if I could gain one buyer, I could gain one thousand.\n2.8 million readers and 20,000 buyers later, my discoveries held true.\nNow, my creative problem-solving has evolved beyond a one-person business.\nNow, I am focused on building Kortex, delegating work without reducing the quality delivered, and not overworking myself.\nOne lesson before we begin:\nYou can\u2019t eradicate manual labor from your life altogether.\nIt is a slow and painful evolution, and sometimes you regress.\nNow that I\u2019ve taken on the responsibility of starting a larger company, my manual work has increased substantially, but I trust that I can lower it quickly with my prior experience.\nWhat we will discuss:\nThe macronutrients of business\nProgressive overload of skill\nTime under attention\nHow to reinvent yourself\nDocumenting your mind on the internet\nHow to create a brand, content, product, and promotions that make you money\nOne other thing before we start \u2013 we have opened up more spots for VIP and Mastermind. If you are a founder, creator, writer, or marketer who wants to work with us directly on your social media brand, content, and product\u2026 apply here.\nThis letter is long, but worth it.\nBodybuilding & Businessbuilding\nWhen you deconstruct the mind and body, you can map patterns that deepen your understanding across most domains of life.\nWe will connect these patterns to the financial domain by starting a business.\nWe can think of the mind as your mental body as we talked about in Mental Aesthetics.\nWe can also think of your business as the body or character you display externally.\nA business is just that, a vessel for value exchange.\nPersonal growth is self-development, business growth is other-development.\nIn nutrition, there are 4 macronutrients:\nFat\nCarbs\nProtein\nAlcohol\nIn business, there are 4 pillars that determine your success:\nBrand\nContent\nProduct\nPromotions\nIn nutrition, there are a plethora of micronutrients that maintain bodily functions.\nIn business, there are skills, interests, experience, knowledge, creativity, and personality that determine the potency of your efforts.\nYour job is to fuel your business with the proper creative nutrition to succeed.\nYou can opt for the business keto diet and take away content as carbs.\nMany people go the direct response marketing route and only use ads to fuel their business, but the benefits of content make it an unreasonable approach (especially for beginners without money to invest in making mistakes to learn advertising\u2026 I learned this the hard way).\nBy having a daily content writing habit:\nYou can validate high-performing ideas as content to use in your ads or promotions.\nYou get to keep the audience you acquire. You aren\u2019t always burning through money to acquire new customers.\nYou create customers over time by writing content for all levels of awareness.\nYou can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on ads.\nOr you can build a 100,000 follower audience over a year and get the same amount of impressions.\nOr you can do both, your call.\nProgressive Overload Of Skill & Challenge\nWhen you are starting out, it is unwise to take on too much as a one-person business.\nYou must become the marketing, sales, operations, and media department.\nTo create a brand, content, product, and promotions, you will need to learn at least the fundamentals of:\nMarketing & sales\nGraphic design\nWeb design\nCopywriting\nContent writing\nEmail marketing\nSocial media\nThis is a blessing and a curse.\nIf you\u2019ve never learned any modern skills, this will take a while.\nYou will get overwhelmed and anxious at the thought of a future you don\u2019t have the skill to create clarity with.\nBut social media is the perfect vessel to build as you learn.\nIn bodybuilding, you progressively overload the muscle by adding weight to the bar over time.\nIf you ego-lift and put on too much weight, you won\u2019t be able to lift it, and you\u2019ll probably look like an idiot.\nStart small and build your skill stack with time.\nDo not start learning until you start building.\nBuy courses, books, and search for content that teaches how to do all of this well as you are building.\nCreate one project.\nSet one goal.\nLearn one skill.\nGet good at it so you have mental energy for the next.\nRepeat.\nBuild your profile. Study social media and graphic design (for your banner and profile picture).\nStart writing content. Study copywriting, content writing, marketing, and post structures.\nIdeate a product. Study marketing, sales, and offer creation.\nLearn to promote. Study email marketing, promotions, and copywriting.\nWith all of this, don\u2019t get complacent.\nIf you don\u2019t seek a higher challenge after you stop seeing good results from the first, you will get bored.\nBoredom leads to thoughts of quitting because you feel like there is something better you could be doing with your time.\nIn the gym, a great thing to do is observe what others are doing to correct your form. You can also watch videos of people online.\nEmulate what others are doing in the creator space.\nPull inspiration from creators\u2019 bios, content, and marketing.\nBut \u2013 and this is a big but \u2013 realize that people more advanced than you are at a different level. What they are doing may not be what they did when they were starting out.\nThis is a long process of experimentation.\nTime Under Attention\nIn weight training, there is a concept known as time under tension.\nSome argue it is the main driver of muscle growth (paired with progressive overload).\nI want to make the same argument for business, but as time under attention.\nThis is arguably the most important thing to pay attention to when building an audience with your writing and content.\nAttention is the currency of the 3rd millennium.\nThe more people pay attention to you, the more power you have.\nAuthors, podcasters, and YouTubers often have the most loyal audiences.\nWhy? Because information creates identity.\nThe more attention you hold, the more information you deliver.\nYou program the minds of your audience in a way that is conducive to actually changing their life.\nYou can write short posts for social media all day long, but someone who has held more attention will always outperform you.\nJames Clear will get more engagement and reach because:\nPeople have adopted his worldview.\nPeople quote him in their content, newsletters, and podcasts.\nAny time someone else posts a related idea to Clear, the authority is given to Clear because he comes to mind while reading your content. Clear is still holding their attention while they read others\u2019 content.\nThis does not mean that short-form content like X, Instagram, or LinkedIn are useless. Quite the opposite. They have their own benefits and use cases.\nDon\u2019t think in black and white here. Think holistically.\nI see short-form platforms as a way to attract a broad audience quicker to fuel your long-form platforms that are arguably more difficult to grow.\nI almost always recommend starting with short-form to build an audience, build a network, and validate high-performing ideas that you can then turn into long-form videos, newsletters, or combine all of them into a book.\nAnd, the longer you do it, the more attention you hold. Quitting after 1-6 months is stupid.\n1% of 50 years is 6 months.\nIf this is the work you see yourself doing for your entire life, don\u2019t quit during the tutorial phase.\nIf I create 365 posts a year (on all platforms) and those posts hold attention for 30 seconds, that\u2019s 3 hours of attention held \u2013 per reader \u2013 on each platform over a year.\nIf I create 1 long-form post a week (for a newsletter, YouTube, and podcast all being the same) and these posts hold 20 minutes of attention, that\u2019s 52 hours of attention held per reader for all platforms.\nI\u2019ll let you come to the conclusion of why I wrote a book that may be purchased by millions.\nSo, it\u2019s important that you treat short-form platforms for what they are:\nA way to build a broad audience faster, validate ideas, and funnel people into various products and long-form content.\nFor writers, I always recommend using X and a newsletter.\nOne short-form and one long-form platform to start.\nThen, when you\u2019ve spent enough time actually seeing growth, you can repurpose all of your best short and long-form content for different platforms. This is what I teach in 2 Hour Writer.\nTurn Your Self Into A Business (Mental Monetization)\nYour self, or identity, is your mental body.\nThe \u201cself\u201d is a web of concepts, beliefs, ideas, experiences, and perceptions that allow you to navigate the world.\nThe information you learn and use since birth is what shapes the self.\nYour identity shapes your perspective, and your perspective is the most important thing you can understand and expand.\nYour perspective is your reality.\nA perspective is a frame composed of goals, problems, and skill to overcome those problems to achieve those goals.\nIt is also composed of beliefs, knowledge, and experiences that either limit or aid in the achievement of goals, solving of problems, and understanding of knowledge.\nWhen we aren\u2019t conscious of the goals or problems that compose our perspective, we are not choosing how we act. The goals were assigned to us.\nIf we don\u2019t have the skill to overcome problems to achieve goals, we get anxious, overwhelmed, and negative to the point of lashing out.\nWhen you don\u2019t seek to understand the goal of someone else in life, social media, politics, religion, or the rest \u2013 it is easy for us to misinterpret their situation and think they are stupid for doing what they do.\nIn reality, we lack perspective.\nWe can\u2019t open our minds to see that we are not the only perspective.\nThe goals and problems that compose your perspective determine what information you perceive as important.\nGiven time, the information you consume either reinforces who you are or changes who you are by expanding your perspective to contain better problems and meaningful goals.\nFrom those meaningful goals, you can acquire a unique combination of skills to achieve them.\nPerson A has an unconscious goal that was assigned to them by society.\nThey were made to believe that getting a job as a doctor was their only path in life.\nSo, whether they know it or not, all of the information, books, podcasts, social media content, and conversations will be interpreted to acquire information that helps them achieve their goal.\nTheir skillset will form from that information as they attempt to achieve the goal.\nThere are more goals and problems influencing interpretation here \u2013 like watching memes on their phone all day because they don\u2019t have a stronger goal that requires them to self-educate to achieve it.\nPerson B has a conscious goal that they chose for themself based on a problem they became aware of.\nThis sets them up for success in more ways than just achieving their goal.\nFirst, it prevents them from being a mindless product of the social matrix (the groundless loop of webbed information passed down from the government, schools, and parents just so they can teach their children the same).\nSecond, the path of changing who they are, creating a unique path in life, and achieving goals that solve burning problems sets them up for a life of meaning, money, and mastery.\nDocumenting Your Mind On The Internet (And Getting Paid To Do So)\nNow we understand a very brief description of the human behavior feedback loop.\nIdentity influences perspective influences perception of situations influences choices influences identity and loops back around to infinity.\nTo turn your mind into a business, your job is to change your behavior for the better so you can change others.\n1) Brand Is Your Online Character Or Identity\nThe front end of a business is a brand. This is what they display online to attract the right people and illustrate their digital identity.\nSince we are turning your self into the business, your job is to attract the people you can help the most:\nPeople that are like you.\nThe people who share the same goals and problems as your past or present self but don\u2019t have the skill to achieve and overcome them.\nYou already have the knowledge, experience, and skills to pass down to those who are one step behind you. That\u2019s all you need to start a business.\nSo, your job on your website, social media profiles, and anywhere your brand is displayed is to:\nImply a meaningful goal you help people achieve.\nImply a burning problem you can help them solve.\nImply the interests or skills that you teach to bridge the gap between problem and goal.\nThis creates your digital reality.\nIt creates the frame that you and your customers share so you can exchange knowledge and skill.\nThis does not have to be explicitly said in your branding.\nIt must be implied in your designs, writing, and video.\nYour brand is created with time under attention as people learn more about you through your content and products.\nMy brand slogan is: Work less. Earn more. Enjoy life.\nMy bio was occasionally: I write about human potential, writing, and mental mastery so you can do what you want.\nI don\u2019t recommend copying these as they probably won\u2019t work for you. I have more time under attention than you and have the freedom to not be as explicit. This will require more study of my other letters like Value Creation or The Greatest Skill Of The 21st Century.\n2) Content Is Your Mindset & Skillset\nContent becomes a necessity when you realize its power.\nMarketers know the power of traffic, a list of interested customers, and the power of long-form writing or video \u2013 but many of them come around to the content game late (like myself).\nThey don\u2019t realize that the long webinar that made you millions can just be a video on YouTube that gets hundreds of thousands of views (once you get the hang of the social media game).\nI understand a webinar funnel, or similar, can be more strategic, but it doesn\u2019t rule out the other benefits of writing content:\nYou enhance your thinking. Your ideas become clear with time and it ripples into the rest of your life. You can\u2019t have a great idea if you don\u2019t write a good idea first. Your first content won\u2019t be that good, that\u2019s okay.\nIt\u2019s free most of the time. You can grow organically, or you can move your ad spend to paid growth by connecting with and having big players share your posts (don\u2019t listen to anyone that tells you this doesn\u2019t work, they don\u2019t understand it. It doesn\u2019t work for them because their brand and content and strategy suck).\nYou create customers. Unlike ads, you keep your audience and can remarket to them at any time. As you create educational content, people become customers because your information shapes who they are.\nYou validate and test ideas fast. I can send out a tweet, and if it does better than usual, I can turn that into a sales page headline, YouTube title, or entire product that I know will sell.\nHere is how I help people I work with to build their brand by dissecting their minds to turn into content.\nFirst, answer these questions (write the answers down so you can write content with the answers):\nWhat are 5-10 beliefs that are seen as \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201ccrazy\u201d to other people but are normal to you? (This is what differentiates you and leads to the most growth.) I.E. I believe entrepreneurship is for everyone and have reasoning from psychology, mechanics, history, and philosophy to back that.\nWhat are 5-10 interests or skills that help you create the lifestyle you live and help your followers achieve?\nWhy are those interests or skills important? What do they help people avoid or gain in life?\nWhat foundational knowledge do people need to understand about those skills or interests? (This keeps you from being too advanced or high level so you actually resonate with people.\nNow, pair these with the 10 Koemmandments of Engagement and try turning everything you listed into content. It also helps to understand the principles of Value Creation which I linked above.\nDuring this process, write so a 5th grader can understand you.\nThat is a huge problem I see in the space. People overcomplicate their message with niche wording that doesn\u2019t attract people to become interested in your interests.\nYou aren\u2019t attracting people who are already interested. You are making them interested through persuasion.\nLastly, here are a few traps people fall into:\nTrap 1 \u2013 They focus way too much on promotions or making sure they only talk about their product.\nTalk about your beliefs, opinions, and educate people on the information necessary to become above average in your interests and skills 80% of the time. Promote sparingly. It\u2019s like cashing in goodwill with your audience.\nTrap 2 \u2013 They don\u2019t understand the importance of structure VS content.\nThis goes far beyond writing content for business. It is a metaphysical principle.\nFor now, take your ideas and use high-performing structures and frameworks as training wheels until you actually develop your writing ability. Look at quotes, newsletter structures, post structures, and the rest and try plugging your ideas into them.\nTrap 3 \u2013 They don\u2019t research or use high-performing angles.\nAny idea can go viral. But only when it is positioned in an attention-grabbing way that entertains, educates, or inspires.\nYou are a dopamine dealer.\nYou raise dopamine levels in your readers\u2019 brains by teaching them something new, giving a new point of view, entertaining them, or showing them they are capable of more in life.\nStudy your favorite accounts\u2019 most popular X posts, Instagram posts, YouTube videos, and start programming your mind to think in high-performing headlines.\nThe lesson of content:\nGood content occurs when you attempt to inject your mindset and skillset into your readers over the course of 6-12 months, not in one post.\n3) Product Is How You Achieved A Meaningful Goal\nWhen you are the niche, people follow you because they want to achieve the lifestyle you have. They want to do what you do.\nYou are already educating them on how to do it with your content.\nThe difference between content and product is convenience, clarity, and a replicable system that gets results.\nWhat is the most meaningful goal you achieved in your life?\n(My example: I earn a living writing about my interests.)\n(Potential example: I got a six-pack without doing cardio.)\n(Another example: I unlocked extreme focus to build my side business.)\nWhat steps do people need to take to get there?\n(My example: Write, build a readership, persuade, sell.)\n(Potential example: Minimalist training and intermittent fasting.)\nWhat do people need to learn to take those steps?\n(My example: Social media, copywriting, content.)\n(Potential example: The principles of training and nutrition.)\nWhat can those people practice and implement in their day to get there?\n(My example: the 2 hour content ecosystem.)\n(Potential example: the executive training system for busy people.)\n(I\u2019m giving these systems fancy names because it is known as a \u201cunique mechanism\u201d in marketing. It is novel. Novelty catches attention and makes people think, \u201cThis may be the thing that finally solves my problem!\u201d)\nBoom, that\u2019s the outline of your product.\nPlease note that those are all brief mediocre examples. Get more specific.\nA \u201cmeaningful goal\u201d that you help people achieve is determined by solving a burning problem within human nature in the eternal markets: health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nIf you haven\u2019t already achieved a meaningful goal in a unique way, I will help you in another letter about mastering new skills fast.\nUntil then:\nSet a goal in one domain of your life.\nDrown yourself in knowledge and education around it.\nDocument that knowledge as content (teaching is how you learn and identify what you don\u2019t know so that you can learn efficiently).\nCrucial: experiment with different techniques (like training programs, diets, ways to make money, etc).\nIdentify the fundamentals, truths, and principles between the different techniques.\nAchieve the goal by creating your own way of getting there.\nThen, distribute that as a digital product that sells while you sleep with obscenely high-profit margins.\nFrom there, you have the resources (readership and income) to build whatever other business your heart desires.\n4) Promotions Are Why You Achieved The Goal\nPeople don\u2019t care about features, they care about benefits.\nAssume that everyone is selfish, because they are, even if that selfishness comes from feeling good about themselves by being selfless.\nMarketing is about creating the most powerful \u201cwhy.\u201d\nA \u201cwhy\u201d implies a transformation.\nTransformations are what people want.\nLike how physique transformation journeys always get a lot of views on YouTube.\nOr how life transformations get you emotional and invested in the person.\nA transformation is a story, and that\u2019s what our minds\u2019 are wired to be attracted to, trust, and connected to.\nSo, you need to do 1 of 2 things:\nTell people why the product will change their life.\nTell people why it changed your life (because they will read it as if they were changing there\u2019s).\nI\u2019ve been a marketer for almost 6 years now.\nHere\u2019s all you need to know to actually make some money.\nA story or transformation is composed of 3 things:\nA burning problem.\nA desirable outcome.\nA clear solution.\nThat\u2019s your entire marketing campaign.\nYou will have to test each one until you strike gold with the right positioning, but then you are set for a while.\nThose 3 components will be used whenever you ask someone to buy your product in your emails, landing page, IG story, YouTube promotion, or the rest.\nLong-form promotions are like a full sales page, you have to fill up the page by guiding people through that structure (go and read the introduction of this letter).\nShort-form promotions are like a call to action inside an email like:\nIf you\u2019ve tried the \u201clatest and greatest\u201d business models without any success (and are considering accepting your fate at a day job), it\u2019s because you are falling for tactics.\nIn Digital Economics, I teach the principles of building a purposeful business.\nBrand, content, product, and promotions so you can talk about your interests and earn a creative income.\nNow, when writing promotions, you have to know what part of your audience you are talking to. How long have they been reading your content and do they understand your philosophy?\nI see this mistake often.\nPeople have very high-level language (like manifesting a life of alignment to be a peaceful being) and their audience couldn\u2019t care less.\nIf you haven\u2019t defined \u201calignment\u201d and \u201cmanifesting\u201d to your beginner-level audience, then don\u2019t write this way.\nBe straightforward. Be simple. Be impactful.\nGive people what they want.\nDon\u2019t give people what you think they want.\nThat\u2019s it for this one, it\u2019s already way too long.\nI hope you enjoyed it.\nDan"

        "content": "You need a routine.\nAnd if you think you don\u2019t, you may not realize that you already have a routine that was assigned to you by society.\nOr your \u201croutine\u201d is not having a routine.\nWithout rules, there is no game.\nWithout a game, there is no winning.\nA routine contains the rules for how you live your life.\nThe longer you play, the better you get, and you often forget the rules and win anyway.\nNow is the time to stop playing the game society told you to play and start playing your own.\nA powerful routine, no matter how long, prevents overwhelm as you progress toward your goals.\nMost people are progressing toward the goals that were given to them.\nThey are progressing the dreams of someone else rather than their own.\nWithout a routine that you created, your life will slowly fall \u2013 faster and faster \u2013 down a chaotic hole into a life of responsibilities, work, people, and a personality that you despise.\nRoutines are comfortable.\nThe mind craves order, and routines allow you to focus your attention to make action seamless.\nThis is why working a job \u201csucks,\u201d but not enough to make you quit and pursue something that sucks more until it sucks less.\nLife is suffering, and we have the ability to choose our suffering every day.\nYour goals are the axis of your suffering, and most people are pursuing goals that aren\u2019t their own. Their suffering doesn\u2019t bring fulfillment.\nReversing Local Entropy With Identity Change\nThe optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy\u2014or attention\u2014is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nYou don\u2019t need motivation or discipline when you are the person who would take certain actions.\nA bodybuilder doesn\u2019t need motivation to eat healthy.\nA gamer doesn\u2019t need discipline to stare at a screen all day.\nA writer doesn\u2019t need motivation to synthesize ideas.\nAn employee doesn\u2019t need discipline to show up to work.\nThey do it because their survival is at stake.\nNot physical, but mental.\nAnimals survive the information in their genetic code.\nHumans survive the information in their consciousness.\nThe information we are exposed to as children and throughout our lives programs our minds to run on certain systems.\nA system, in brief, is the process of reaching a goal (this can get extremely complex).\nSo, our identity is a web of conscious and unconscious goals that determine the skills we acquire, the interests we learn, and the choices we make in alignment with those goals.\nYou are already acting toward layers of unconscious goals every second of the day. They\u2019ve been conditioned to the point of not requiring conscious thought. You wake up, walk, brush your teeth (maybe), and put on your clothes so that you aren\u2019t seen as an outcast. These are all skills that you have developed as a human with the goal of fitting in and surviving in society.\nThis goes deep. The social matrix of goals creates humans that all operate in a similar fashion. With a slightly different goal of society, we could all be walking around naked and communicating with each other by tapping people on the head with a stick. Biological goals clearly influence this.\nWhen we do not have clarity on how to achieve a goal, our mind becomes disordered. We become overwhelmed, anxious, and narrow-minded.\nOur mind declines into chaos.\nThis is known as entropy. Entropy is Universal. It doesn\u2019t only apply to things like buildings that fall apart with time unless maintained. The structure of your mind, or identity, is an invisible building.\nYou reverse entropy by making a goal conscious, creating a path to achieve it, and focusing your attention on priority actions that bring results as feedback.\nThe priority actions include daily education and practice that expose you to the information that creates an identity.\nWe will talk about how to master new skills quickly in a future letter, but for now, understand this:\nYou need a plan.\nThere isn\u2019t any other way.\nBecause if you don\u2019t have one, society does, and they\u2019ve been planning your life for decades.\nIf you don\u2019t set your own goals, acquire the skill necessary to take on the challenge, and forge your own path \u2013 your destiny will be manhandled by society and you won\u2019t even realize it.\nNobody wants to wake up 40 years later wondering where the time went.\nThe 4 Pillars Of The Good Life (How To Reverse Entropy)\nBecoming multi-dimensionally jacked is the path to the good life.\nAll of these domains of life are interconnected systems that create who you are and reverse entropy in your mind. Tiny improvements are what create an ordered mind.\nBy adopting a daily habit for each pillar of your life, success becomes inevitable.\nMy question to you:\nIf you aren\u2019t building your mind, body, business, and relationships every single day \u2013 what are you doing?\nGenuine question.\nIs there anything more important than that?\nOr is everything you do now a distraction?\n\u201cBut Dan, I want to enjoy myself and do what I want.\u201d\nDo you understand what enjoyment is when compared to pleasure?\nDo you realize that human psychology has been mapped over the course of evolution to show that humans have an innate drive to grow, expand, transcend, and create?\nEnjoyment is found in progress.\n\u201cDoing what you want\u201d is often the ego ending the train of thought that would lead to you improving yourself \u2013 because that\u2019s what your nature wants.\nYou can truly do what you want when you peel back the layers of what you think you want.\nI\u2019m not going to give you a super scientific approach to habit formation.\nI\u2019m going to give you the only real way to make behavior change seamless with time:\n1) Align Your Future With A Holistic Goal\nGoals can\u2019t exist without the awareness of a problem.\nGoals and problems create a frame for your perspective.\nYour perspective determines what information you perceive as important.\nA person who has money problems and the goals of society will see a new job opportunity as important.\nA person who has money problems and self-generated goals will see a promising business opportunity as important.\nBoth people will read a book and interpret it in a different way.\nOne will store information in their mind that is conducive to their goals and solves their problems.\nThe first step to changing your life is to become brutally aware of the problems that make you want to change your life.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, then you obviously have problems, everybody does.\nThe big problem is a lack of awareness of your problems.\nSit and become negative for a while.\nLet your mind run wild to create an anti-vision for your future.\nWhat is the worst-case scenario if you continue with the same mental, physical, financial, and relational actions you are taking?\nThen use that as a place to toss an anchor into the future.\nCreate a big, vision-generating goal that encapsulates each domain of life.\nNext, we will bridge the gap between where you are now with where you want to be with self-education and skill acquisition.\n2) Treat Daily Self-Education As An Absolute Necessity\nSchools are necessary in many cases, but they teach you a microscopic fraction of reality.\nThey train you into a compartment of reality \u2013 like chemistry, physiology, or literature \u2013 and lack regard for the holistic interconnectedness that breeds true intelligence.\nWithout self-education, you go through life with the same narrow identity and perspective as everyone else.\nEducation expands your mind.\nIt introduces you to novel perspectives.\nIt increases dopamine in the brain as a consistent source of energy.\nIt gives you the knowledge to act with clarity toward your goals.\nOver time, education conditions your mind to run on new systems.\nIf you were to only immerse your mind in information that taught you how to build a profitable business, you would.\nIt took you 18+ years to shape your actions with education from your parents, friends, and schools \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a few years to shape your actions with information that you curate.\n3) Acquire The Skillset Necessary To Achieve Your Goals\nThe difference between where you are and where you want to be is skill.\nThis is a fact.\nYou don\u2019t have the results you want because you aren\u2019t the person with the skill that would get those results.\nThe only thing that can stop you is getting distracted to the point of falling off the path.\nSkills can be trained.\nLearning to walk and speak are arguably the most complex skills you\u2019ve ever learned. They are more complex than building a billion-dollar company.\nThe thing is, you didn\u2019t have a mind chained by limits that you were taught by people who didn\u2019t break through their own.\nWith this, you need 2 things:\nA 30-60 minute self-education habit \u2013 read, buy courses, listen to podcasts, and acquire ample knowledge that provides you the capability to act.\nA 30-60 minute building habit\u2013 apply your knowledge in reality and experiment with what you learn. Get feedback and iterate until success.\nLearning comes from struggle, not memorization.\nWhen you build in the real world and hit a wall, a problem is created.\nYou may or may not become aware of the problem depending on your skill and experience (this is what prevents most people\u2019s progress, they blame their lack of progress on anything but their own ability).\nThe problem sits in your subconscious mind to filter the information you get from your self-education.\nAs you repeat this process of education and building, for 1-5 years, you will be awestruck by how far you come.\nThe Daily Routine That Changed My Life\nMy current daily routine is as follows.\nI will provide the reasons and whys behind each of these parts of my routine.\nThis is an important point:\nEvery aspect of your routine should be intentional.\nIntention = what you are stretching towards.\nThe more reasons or whys you can stack behind your actions, the easier it becomes and the more beneficial it is to a great future.\nYou discover these reasons or whys by having a goal to apply your self-education to.\nIf I want to commit to a gym habit, self-education around habit formation and the gym will give me the reasoning necessary to do so \u2013 if and only if I am building in reality.\nPlease note that this routine may not be feasible for you now.\nPlease also note that this was the process of years of experimentation to find what I deemed enjoyable and conducive to my desired future.\nI encourage you to take bits and pieces to experiment with in your own life until you can create a routine that fits you.\n1) 30-minute morning walk.\nFirst thing in the morning, around 6am, I get outside no matter the weather or how I feel.\nI will either listen to educational material or plan out my day on my phone.\nI aim for 15-20,000 steps a day because of the stacked benefits it brings to my life. Walking is one of those activities that requires minimal effort but brings maximum results.\nWalking clears my mind, wakes me up, gets me away from distractions, acts as a creativity block in my day, keeps me lean, keeps me healthy, keeps me (slightly) tan, and reverses most of the damage done by sitting under life-sucking blue light.\nNote: I am experimenting with slowing down my mornings even more contrary to most entrepreneur advice of \u201cgetting straight into work.\u201d\nFor the past few days, I have been doing 30 minutes of meditation followed by 30 minutes of reading (Psycho Cybernetics right now).\nI walk enough throughout the day.\n2) 90 minutes of focused work.\nI have a list of recurring tasks and levers that I execute every morning.\nThis is when I write (books, newsletters, content, and marketing material).\nI stack all of my priority tasks in this work block so I can complete them before most people wake up.\nThis allows me to gradually introduce entropy into my day as work becomes less structured.\nI teach how to become a digital writer in 2 Hour Writer.\n3) 30-minute run or walk.\nThree times a week I run for 30 minutes.\nI do this to reap the benefits of the general 150 minutes of zone 2 cardio a week (I consider my excessive walking to fill in the rest).\nI\u2019ve personally noticed that running improves my focus, stress tolerance, body composition (less water, more vascularity), and allows me to sleep at night knowing I \u201cdid the hard thing.\u201d I hate running.\nOn all other days I walk, listen to educational material, and collect ideas in my phone (using Kortex) to channel into my creations and products.\n4) 90 minutes of focused work.\nAfter my run, I shower, eat breakfast, and sit back down to work.\nDuring this block, I do less creative tasks.\nI\u2019ll help with administrative work, client work, and introduce myself to people-oriented things.\nThis is when open loops and distractions start to take over, but not so much that they can\u2019t be mitigated by another walk.\nI break down my deep work morning routine here.\n5) Take calls and/or another walk.\nIf you\u2019ve been following me for a while, this is a new block.\nI used to despise calls and removed them from my days.\nWith Kortex, this isn\u2019t possible. I had to accept that.\nI want Kortex to succeed more than I don\u2019t want to take calls, therefore I want to take calls.\nMost days, I work 4-5 hours. (Even with my excessive workload, I am still close to The 4 Hour Workday philosophy I have which I talk about in my book.).\nThese calls include client calls, internal company calls, design calls, and product calls spread out throughout the week.\nIf I don\u2019t have to be at my desk, I will take these calls on yet another walk.\n6) Go to the gym.\nBy now, it is around 1-2pm.\nThis is the turning point in my day from work to rest.\nI know that I won\u2019t be able to operate at my best after the gym, so I treat this as a work cutoff time.\nI train every day, so not rest days unless my body needs it (please don\u2019t reply with your latest and greatest training ideology).\nOf course, with Kortex, the book launch, and everything else on my plate, I may have work spillover during this phase of my life.\n7) A long conversational lunch.\nI keep an extremely small social circle.\nI\u2019ve had many contacts in the past, but it has always subtracted from my life rather than adding to it.\nAfter the gym, I get lunch with my good friend and decompress.\n8) Take a nap, walk, read, or finish busy work.\nBy now it\u2019s 3-4pm.\nThings are getting boring now so I will spare you, but this part of my day is crucial for psychological recovery.\nIf you train your body in the gym, you need to recover.\nIf you train your mind with work, you need to recover.\nDifferent domains, same Universal pattern.\n9) Go to dinner or spend time with my girlfriend.\nI love nice dinners.\nIt\u2019s a bad habit (sort of, nice dinners are much healthier than fast food, and I don\u2019t order the most calorie-dense things on the menu).\nMost nights I\u2019ll go out to dinner with a close friend or spend the night in watching shows and catching up with my girlfriend.\nThat\u2019s my entire day.\nIt is comprised of intensity, consistency, curiosity, learning, building, mind, body, business, relationships, and the rest that create my future self and lifestyle in real-time.\nOf course, this daily routine is subject to change if there is an event in my life.\nI do other things throughout the week.\nThis is just the default that I fall back to.\nI hope you enjoyed this letter.\nUse the information as you will.\nDan"

        "content": "In today\u2019s world, one of the worst things you can do is get trapped in the mind of the \u201cnoble brokie.\u201d\nMany intelligent people I know hate online business, marketing, and sales because they think it is \u201cbelow\u201d them.\nThey get locked into what they think is a \u201chigher\u201d perspective that demonizes the sleazy salesman. In reality, this is an illusion. This \u201chigher\u201d perspective is filled with misunderstanding, a lack of empathy, and hate.\nIt is on par with if not a lower level of consciousness than the \u201csleazy salesman\u201d himself.\nThis is similar to how democrats and republicans argue to defend the ideology they identify with. Similar to atheists and theists. When they engage in these narrow-minded arguments, there is no chance of discovering the holistic truth of the situation.\nLet\u2019s start to deconstruct what this holistic truth is:\nIf you don\u2019t start a business to provide information, education, and goods that make a better humanity \u2013 then unethical businesses rise to the top without competition making a worse humanity.\nThe reason that unethical businesses flood the marketplace is that you aren\u2019t as conscious or intelligent as you think.\nYou are directly contributing to evil by not starting a business to raise the collective consciousness.\nBy doing nothing but demonizing money and businesses that are the lifeblood of society, you are assigned a job where the employer is more than likely unethical by your standards.\nYou won\u2019t start a business because of your delusional assumptions and conditioning that it is unethical to make money \u2013 but you are working for a business that makes the population sick, contributes to bombing people across the world, and locks employees into robotic routines so they wouldn\u2019t dare achieve their potential.\nPeople criticize new creator education businesses as \u201cgrifts\u201d and \u201cscams\u201d for solving the only true problems that will raise the baseline consciousness of humanity.\nPeople who sell education, courses, and coaching in the health, wealth, relationships, and happiness domains of life are attacking the root of positive behavior change. I discuss the importance of education in You Have $100,000 Trapped In Your Head.\nIf humanity is only as strong as its weakest link, and 99% of people suffer from the same survival problems, and education is what allows the individual to solve their own problems (rather than prescribing temporary relief), and problems are what prevent personal to collective evolution, and if the education system is focused on training people into jobs for its own benefit, then the new digital society of value creators is one realistic path out of this mess.\nBack to the main argument\u2026\nBy doing nothing, you allow people less conscious and intelligent than you to have more attention, impact, and money than you.\nMoney creates a ripple effect and allows them to spread their message further, hire employees (that contribute to said unethical practices), and compound the attention they hold in society.\nThe only way you can stop people from paying attention to one thing is to give them something more persuasive to pay attention to.\nThis issue is not as simple as \u201cjust starting a business to make money.\u201d\nEverything is connected and you are unconsciously allowing the entire Universe to tilt in the hands of evil by not becoming a conscious business owner that impacts its customers, employees, readers, economy, and the rest to infinity.\nSpirituality is understanding your part in the whole of the Universe.\nSpirituality is not disconnecting from that whole to live in the woods and letting the Universe decline into chaos.\nSpirituality then can be considered, and felt, when you attempt to reverse entropy by putting effort and energy into the progress and evolution of humanity.\nHappiness is the feeling that power increases \u2014 that resistance is being overcome. \u2014 Nietzsche\nIf you hate money, do you not hate your life?\nEverything around you right now from the phone in your hands to the roads you drive on to the desk you sit at to the food that keeps you alive are all products from a business that makes money for their contribution to the advancement of civilization.\nYou are drowning in a world that was built by the drive of money stemming from survival.\nI discuss the importance of money, marketing, and sales from a spiritual lens in my new book, The Art of Focus. If you want a practical philosophy for meaning, money, and mastery pick it up here.\nThe Importance And Unignorability Of Money\n\u201cThe best way to make money is teaching others how to make money.\u201d\nI see people say this quite often.\nSome people say it as wisdom.\nOthers act like it is a sentence that dismantles any business advice so they don\u2019t have to face reality.\nSome people see this saying as a bad thing when money rules people\u2019s lives. It is the one thing holding them back from reaching the next level of their personal development. It dictates almost every single action a person takes, even the most \u201cspiritual\u201d people, because money is deeply intertwined with modern survival.\nWhy do you work 8 hours a day for 45 years? Because you need to pay the bills and support your family.\nWhy do you go off and live in the woods like a monk? Because you want to eliminate the need for money to pursue personal development. (To think this is what everyone should do is more foolish than leaving society to rot. \u201cAll is one\u201d until you actually have to take responsibility for the health of the world, so you choose to check out instead).\nWhy do you go to the gym and eat healthy foods? To be healthy, yes, but there\u2019s more. You want to increase your perceived status so you can attract better opportunities, advance your career, and make more money.\nWhy am I typing on my keyboard right now? To help you out, yes, but there is not only one reason behind anyone\u2019s actions. Writing is my business. I write on a weekly business because I get paid to do so, among a plethora of other benefits it brings to my life.\nWhy are you reading this? To get a new perspective, yes, but it will open your mind to reduce the limiting beliefs around making money.\nAlmost every action you take has money as an attached reason.\nMoney is deeply rooted in modern survival.\nIf you look at Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, each stage requires money in the modern world.\nThe financial domain of your life is just like any other domain.\nLike a skill tree in a video game.\nAll domains of your life require seeds to be planted over time for a garden to flourish.\nTo achieve health, you need money.\nTo achieve fulfilling relationships, you need to solve the problem that destroys 99% of them\u2026 money.\nTo be happy (moreso to enjoy life since happiness is a fickle metric) you need to make progress toward a meaningful goal. You need to build. Building requires resources. Resources require money.\nWhen you ignore the need for money, you limit how far you can go in your mental, physical, and even spiritual practices.\nSpiritual practices? Yes. If you have a poor relationship with the lifeblood of the material world then your spirituality is stunted. You can\u2019t acquire the resource that allows you to contribute to the spiritual evolution of humanity.\nEverything is \u201cteaching people how to make money\u201d and advance their career no matter if its advice positioned from the perspective of relationships, health and fitness, or learning a new skill like digital art.\nHell, why do you go to school for 12 to 24 years of your life? To increase your earning capacity of course. Yes, you learn how to operate within society, but what is the lifeblood of society?\nWhat do they teach in school? Is it only \u201chow to make money?\u201d Or is it an interest you can adopt to eventually help you make money?\nBack on the topic of the creator economy\u2026\nDo you not see that the only way to make money in the new economy is from people who created the jobs and opportunities to make money in that economy?\nJust because you don\u2019t understand it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t useful.\nDo you not see that the only way to make money in the old economy is from the institutions and constructs that created those jobs?\nEverything evolves. Let go of what you thought worked 10 years ago.\nSchools teach outdated and less profitable ways to make money, because more profitable ones emerged with the creation of the internet. Just like how more profitable jobs emerged after the creation of the tractor and everything else.\nBy viewing everything as a scam you are delaying your development by years if not your entire life.\nThis is the phase of evolution we are in and you are missing out on what will be the new normal.\nYou Can\u2019t Avoid Learning \u201cUnethical\u201d Skills\nThe most successful people are those who study unethical tactics and use them in an ethical way.\nSales\nMarketing\nPersuasion\nHypnosis\nInfluence\nGame\nTheir work, business, and pursuit of lofty goals are the modalities for integrating their shadow. (I teach all of these, except hypnosis, inside Digital Economics from a philosophical business lens)\nThey\u2019re all the same thing when you zoom out to see the principles.\nAll of these \u201cunethical\u201d skills are just understanding human nature, psychology, and patterns of the Universe like storytelling (even architecture and music):\nMusic is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music. \u2013 Goethe\nEveryone has a dark side.\nLike the ugly underside of a floor rug or the bass note of a song.\nThe Universe is a balance of creation and destruction, unity and division, birth and death. Buildings are destroyed so new ones can be built. Your past self dies so your ideal self and birth.\nYou are not pure good.\nIt is impossible to be pure good when \u201cgood\u201d is relative and would not exist without evil.\nPeople that try to suppress it, rather than integrate it, have that dark side manifest in unconscious ways. Often, the people who say they aren\u2019t manipulative are the most manipulative, they just aren\u2019t aware of it.\nGetting a sales job or starting a marketing business is a great way to integrate your shadow. You are given a choice to use skills for good or evil. You get to see the outcome and how it impacts you and your customers.\nSpiritual masters are not \u201call good,\u201d they\u2019ve just learned to integrate the bad and not let their song of a life be written as a depressing one. There will be lows in your story, but when you zoom out, how will it turn out?\nA good way to think about your skill stack is like a mutual fund.\nIf one stock goes down, the mutual fund can still be up.\nIf one skill is \u201cunethical,\u201d that may be the unlock to your business being profitable, ethical, and impactful.\nTo Be Human Is To Transcend, Expand, and Create\nThe world is going mental.\nAs a species, we are transcending the physical thanks to technology, science, and computational power.\nWe are unifying as a species \u2013 the unity of consciousness \u2013 through technology. Would that have been possible without money?\nWhile most see social media as a net negative to humanity, I couldn\u2019t disagree more.\nSocial media is where we are documenting the collective mind.\nWe share thoughts, opinions, ideas, creations, and our identity. We are uploading our minds to the internet. Not just creators. Content is the collective mind.\nSocial media dissolves the boundary of how we are communicating.\nIt\u2019s like people are waiting in line to go inside their screens. They stare at it all day. Like there is a primordial pull to become one with every other mind.\nYour entire identity is already on the screen anyway, but there\u2019s still a barrier that is the screen.\nImagine a world where you can send a signal that is a thought to another person. Imagine a world where you are reading my newsletters are fed into your mind without reading them. Imagine a world where you are watching my videos and I\u2019m right there with you.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the Lex Fridman podcast with Mark Zuckerberg (The First Interview In The Metaverse), that future isn\u2019t too far off. They have a podcast in virtual reality where their avatars are hyper-realistic. It\u2019s mind-blowing.\nI recently switched The Art Of Focus event from in-person to virtual \u2013 and one objection to this change is that in-person would be more valuable, a different kind of energy.\nWhile I\u2019m sure this is true now, what about in the future? What if virtual events were as real as physical, but the flow of information was instant and the experience was nothing like we can conceptualize right now?\nAnother question:\nYou have the entire world\u2019s knowledge at your fingertips. How does that make you feel?\nYou have the capacity to learn, expand your sense of self, and start a business that provides value to the world.\nWhen polled for what kids wanted to be when they grew up, the highest-voted option was a \u201cYouTuber.\u201d\nWhile most see this as delusional and impossible, I see it as natural and really the only option in the future. Maybe not specifically as a \u201cYouTuber,\u201d but as a creator like the Universe. You are a being that creates with your mind.\nMost people label wanting influence and attention as \u201cvanity\u201d but few people realize reasoning can\u2019t be reduced to a singular \u201cwhy.\u201d There is always something deeper and unconscious pushing us to act and make decisions.\nThere are multiple \u201cwhys\u201d behind our cares, wants, and desires.\nYour reasoning behind your actions becomes more holistic as you expand and transcend to new levels of mind.\nYour level of mind determines your values.\nYou didn\u2019t choose to sit around and think about money, social media, and skill acquisition.\nYou make an automatic decision based on the structure of your psyche.\nFor many, they were assigned ideology, beliefs, systems, and business models that sounded \u201cgood\u201d and began defending their beliefs as the best and only.\nWhen you zoom out, push into the unknown, and make progress by solving problems that increase your level of mind \u2013 you can see money for what it truly is: a piece of paper that can benefit yourself and others massively.\nA Brief Summary Of Why You Aren\u2019t Successful\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you say you want to help others, but you won\u2019t learn the skills that allow you to help others.\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you focus too much on art, and then blame the market when they don\u2019t see the value in what you have to offer (because you couldn\u2019t articulate it with marketing and sales).\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you \u201cfocus on your craft\u201d rather than getting your craft in front of potential customers. Your websites, designs, writing, and other projects do not count until other people see them. You are delaying the time to feedback. Without feedback, you can\u2019t make it valuable. Your first iteration will not be valuable.\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you have an incomplete perspective on what business is. It is how you participate in the advancement of humanity by creating a product that raises the collective consciousness.\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you took these points as personal attacks, closed your mind to your potential, and allowed your conditioning to rule you.\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you don\u2019t create something valuable that the market wants to pay for. People don\u2019t want what your ego wants, they want what Mother Nature wants, and who are you to act like you know what that should be?\nYou aren\u2019t successful because you find comfort in the beliefs that you believe are high and mighty. You lock yourself into a paradigm that prevents you from growing as an individual. You begin coping rather than creating.\nSelf-development is a gateway drug into entrepreneurship because you realize that improving others is the next level of improving yourself.\nTo become successful, there is one golden rule:\nProvide value to others.\nThis means two things:\nYou must cultivate your value. You must expand your mind, identify problems, acquire skills to solve them, and make tangible progress in reality. (You can\u2019t just sit around and learn theory all day, you must practice.\nYou must distribute your value. You need a vessel \u2013 AKA a business \u2013 to distribute a product or service that the market wants to buy. If they don\u2019t want it, it isn\u2019t as valuable as you think.\nIn other words, you need self-development and other-development.\nPersonal growth and business growth.\nBusiness is how you provide value to others at scale.\nHow do you cultivate and distribute value in the modern world?\nSocial media. Virtual reality.\nSocial media is your public school, public resume, and public portfolio.\nIt holds the holy trifecta of the good life: Learning, building, and selling.\nYou cultivate your value by learning new knowledge.\nYou solidify your value by building new projects.\nYou distribute your value by selling those projects.\nAll 3 result in a more valuable skillset and mindset.\nNow, this letter was about mindset. It was to help you bust through limiting beliefs and provide you with a worldview conducive to a better future for yourself.\nIf you want previous letters on skillset, I\u2019d recommend starting with my entrepreneurship letters. Scroll to the bottom and start there.\nTalk soon,\nDan Koe\nP.S. The price for The Art Of Focus Keepsake Box increases in under a week (you won\u2019t receive another Koe Letter before then).\nIt has new pricing options and a better virtual event.\nCheck it out here."

Hit snooze 4 times. Stare at your phone. Roll out of bed. Make coffee. Sit in traffic. Eight hours of unfulfilling work. Sit in traffic . . . again. Argue with your \u201csignificant\u201d other. Walk the pet. Watch TV. Pass out. Repeat.\nHumanity is conditioned to follow a default path in life that is set out by society. The 99% of people that do what they\u2019re told, question nothing, and pass down what they know lead to a population that can\u2019t think for themselves.\nThis leads to a dull, mechanical, and mindless life.\nIn my childhood, I made the observation that if everyone does the same thing, they will get the same results, and it\u2019s not hard to see that most people aren\u2019t happy with those results.\nFew people set and even fewer people stick to their own goals. Yet that is the only way to evolve. A goal implies a problem and that problem is what allows you to develop your skillset and mindset. It is what leads to a more complex identity that can find meaning and progress in life.\nThis \u201cdefault path\u201d is pronounced in our times. This is the main problem that you must overcome.\nThere is an abundance of information, opportunities, and convenience. We will label most of these \u2013 except for the ones you filter with critical thought \u2013 as distractions. Distractions lead you further away from who you are and who you want to become.\nThe solution to a mediocre life is focus.\nHumans can process 10\u201350 bits of information per second with their conscious attention. The what, how, and why behind that information we choose to process will determine our quality of life. That is, what we hold in our attention, how we interpret that information, and why we gave it our attention in the first place is of utmost importance.\nWe can consider the approximate 125 billion bits of information you process through focus in your lifetime as your potential.\nWith a large chunk of this dedicated to grooming, errands, and other base responsibilities, we must care deeply about where we direct our focus, as it will determine the outcome of our lives.\nThroughout the book, all I ask is that you:\nRead with a radically open mind. Do not label or judge immediately, but seek to understand what I am saying through direct experience. This may take days, years, or decades.\nQuestion, challenge, and build with the ideas. The ideas in this book will shape the outcome of your life, just like any other idea you come across. I hope that you use them, test them, iterate on them, and make them better so that you can contribute to humanity.\nDo not take what I say as law. I am one perspective out of infinite. None of what I say is absolute truth. It served my life in certain situations, and may in yours, but it may not resonate at all.\nWith that, let\u2019s dig into the meat of the book.\nII \u2013 The Principles\nPrinciples are timeless, tactics are with the times.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore tactics, but know they are temporary in the results they provide across any domain of life.\nThe Art Of Focus is written with 27 principles in mind. I will list them in a rapid-fire fashion here.\n1) The supreme law of the Universe in entropy. Nothing is permanent from emotions to ideas to your health to the systems that the education system relies on to secure your future.\n2) Systems thinking \u2013 or understanding the goal, process, and problem of any crevice of reality \u2013 is how you rig situations in your favor.\n3) Psychic entropy \u2013 or disorder in the mind \u2013 means that we must create and maintain order in our lives through self-generated goals, a path to achieve them, and problems to focus on right now. So we don\u2019t get consumed by distractions.\n4) The structure of the information we focus our attention on \u2013 or the content in our consciousness \u2013 determines our quality of life. But information is in-formation. It is ever-changing. Impermanent. What you focus on must adapt and change on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.\n5) Zooming out to see the big picture of a situation allows you to see negative situations for what they are\u2026 not that serious.\n6) Self-experimentation is the only way to solve your problems for good, make novel discoveries in your life, and gain true experience.\n7) Your mind is an information-processing machine. We imitate the environment around us to survive. Intelligent imitation is how you leverage the benefits of \u201cfitting in\u201d while not becoming a mindless slave to the systems of society.\n8) Closed-mindedness closes you off to discoveries, insights, and truths that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be found. Radical open-mindedness allows you to expand as an individual and collect the perspective necessary to succeed.\n9) Observation and questioning are how you learn to navigate difficult situations with wisdom and grace.\n10) There is a distinction between judgment and discernment. Judgment leads to closed-mindedness, but discernment allows you to pull from other\u2019s experiences in a way that helps you make wise decisions for your own development.\n11) The cause of most people\u2019s suffering is the expectations people have compared to the reality of a situation. The present moment isn\u2019t supposed to be anything other than what it\u2019s being.\n12) When you practice radical acceptance, you begin to see situations for what they are. There is nothing you can think that will change the situation.\n13) One can know a lot but understand very little. Knowledge is constructed upward while understanding is discovered inward.\n14) The only way to make novel discoveries is to explore the unknown. Reality exploration must become a daily practice. You must puncture the default path you\u2019ve been conditioned to live.\n15) The world needs more holistic synthesizers. Those who explore reality and connect the dots between multiple domains rather than getting stuck in one pocket and basing their entire identity around that.\n16) The modern world favors productivity but neglects creativity. This leads to robotic and efficient machines that are no longer human. Create the efficient systems that your mind loves, but don\u2019t hesitate to evolve beyond them and discover the next problem that must be solved.\n17) The mind makes sense of the world through storytelling. Life unfolds in chapters and phases. It is an unfolding of problems, calls to adventure, curiosity, exploration of the unknown, struggle, insight, transformation, solution, and climax. Flow with them all.\n18) Success cannot exist without failure. Failure is a reference point that reveals a problem from which you generate a goal to discover a lesson.\n19) Iteration and persistence is better than complacency and consistency.\n20) Reality is not black and white, but the extremes get the most attention. The magic is found in the grey area that can only be found by questioning everything.\n21) Our perspective determines the positive or negative interpretation of situations. The truth seeker must hunt for kernels of truth to cultivate a more holistic perspective that allows for more positive interpretations.\n22) You don\u2019t get rid of the ego, you develop it to the point of being at one with reality.\n23) Every problem you encounter in life demands an increase in your level of mind, openness of your perspective, or complexity of self.\n24) Humans survive on the mental plane of existence. We survive the idea that is our identity and everything that allows that identity to maintain its form.\n25) Mastery sets you apart in a world that can\u2019t see beyond the miserable surface.\n26) Tactical stress is a strategy to throw yourself into the unknown and see what you are capable of. It forces education, skill acquisition, and expansion of perspective.\n27) If you need something from another, it is nearly impossible to act with authenticity. Selfishness must be a priority for those who have not developed themselves to the point of independence.\nIII \u2013 The 3 Pillars\nFrom my exploration, experience, and reflection there are 3 pillars to the good life: focus, energy, and experience.\nThe ability to focus your attention on a meaningful goal, holding that in the back of your mind as a distraction repellent, knowing exactly how to achieve it through prior experience, and refocusing on the choice in front of you is a superpower.\n1 \u2013 Focus\nFocus is a muscle that can be trained. Just like you can condition your body with physical training, you can condition your mind with mental training.\nFocus has a frame that we call perspective or worldview. This is conditioned by the information you process throughout your life. Your perspective restricts what you can perceive and interpret in any situation.\nPerspective is constructed with the goals you plan to achieve, paths you know to achieve them, and problems that must be identified to achieve them. Note: if you do not know what goals you are pursuing, you are pursuing the ones society assigned to you.\nYour focus will be limited to the aspects of reality that your perspective allows. Unless you create goals that launch you into the unknown, a problem that you consider a normal part of life won\u2019t reveal itself as a problem. Because of that, you will have nothing to learn, discover, or act on in any meaningful fashion. This is how you train your focus. By setting and pursuing interest-based goals that allow your mind to become aware of new information that leads to the evolution of who you are.\nThis stresses the importance of radical open-mindedness. If you are in a constant state of closed-mindedness, stress, and narrow focus an opportunity to change your life may pass you by. And you\u2019ll justify your inability by blaming anything or anyone but yourself.\nWith time, your newly trained mind will gain the ability to filter signal from noise, and your focus will be biased toward the information that brings prosperity to your life.\n2 \u2013 Energy\nSpecific goals demand a specific amount of mental energy to actualize.\nWhen you are locked into the default path, you are spending mental energy towards the goals that society assigned to you. This makes it difficult to invest in the goals you truly want to achieve.\nEntropy, or nature\u2019s tax, is the measure of disorder in a system and the driving force of evolution. It shows that everything falls apart with time unless an effort is made to reverse entropy. Energy is required to maintain order in a system.\nA system has a purpose, a path for achieving that purpose, and problems to invest energy in along the way. Society has had years to construct systems for the attention of the masses. If you don\u2019t want to live an average life, time must be dedicated to both creating and maintaining systems in all areas of your life.\nIt is necessary that you create a hierarchy of goals across the domains of health, wealth, relationships, and happiness and invest mental energy into them often, if not daily. If you don\u2019t, you will only continue to focus on the default path and end up like everyone else. That isn\u2019t pretty.\n3 \u2013 Experience\nThe essence of experience, life, and science is trial and error. You cannot take ideas, opinions, or advice as law without the filter of direct experience. Even if that advice is my own.\nExperience is gained by identifying problems in your life, solving them, and making your process more efficient by evolving the systems your mind operates on.\nWith ample experience, the feedback loop of focus and energy tightens. Your results in life compound because what you filter from the information you interpret is more conducive to meaningful action.\nIV \u2013 The Universe\nStruggle is a Universal principle. It is silly to think that it isn\u2019t supposed to be a part of your life. But that is what we do. We expect life to be a certain way, when it isn\u2019t supposed to be anything other than what it\u2019s being.\nThe Universe is the identity of reality.\nI choose the word \u201cUniverse\u201d with a capital U instead of cultural labels like \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cBrahman,\u201d or \u201cTeotl\u201d because one, they all point to the same thing, and two, because people get overly emotional about the one they identify with. They disagree on a conceptual level but agree on an experiential level.\nTo make sense of it no matter your beliefs, The Universe is everything. The word is a concept that points to an experience. You have experienced it before, but you may not label it as that because your conditioning has forced you into a narrow perspective that can\u2019t integrate the truths of a belief system you think disagree with when it isn\u2019t disagreement, it\u2019s misunderstanding. This is coming from a former atheist and heavy skeptic. Get out of your head. No amount of words can prove what allows words to exist.\nThe Universe is divided into infinite creative parts called ideas. Everything, or every idea, is connected and layered to allow you to make sense of the world.\nYou don\u2019t have a sense of purpose because you are disconnected from the ideas that allow you to see that purpose. You have not explored reality to the point of making sense of \u2013 or creating \u2013 your place in the world.\nThese ideas are impermanent and ever-flowing. The Uni-verse, or one song, can be seen as a harmony unfolding before your eyes. There are highs, lows, problems, solutions, rising actions, falling actions, climaxes, and resolutions. These patterns reflect across all of life. Especially the stories and games that form the structure of most situations, but few people zoom out to observe this structure.\nIn a practical sense, humans experience suffering when they cannot see the full story or game. They isolate one situation with their focus and hold it in their mind like a static image. Reality is moving forward while you are trapped in the past.\nWhen we harness the creative ability of our minds to view life from above, we can discover, collect, and harness profound insights that bring us peace and progress below.\nYour life feels meaningless because you are not grounded in the present moment. This is not about organized religion or a belief system. This is about tapping into the highest perspective there is to become more creative than you ever have.\nIf creativity is the key to becoming irreplaceable, and your creativity depends on the openness or expansion of your mind, understanding the Universe as natural law will put you ahead of 99% of people. As above, so below.\nV \u2013 The Self\nYou are being attracted to your highest version, and the depth of your core can sense it. The external call to evolve requires you to chisel inward beneath the mental constructs that have been layered through your conditioning. Your internal state must become one with the ever-changing external state.\nHumans are pattern recognition and learning machines. Since we were born, we absorb ideas like a sponge and adopt groups of ideas, or ideologies, as law. This narrows our mind and limits what we perceive as important.\nSociety gets to us early, because most people are mindless, and the friends, parents, and teachers that condition our minds had theirs conditioned by their friends, parents, and teachers. Few people have a self that is a conscious personal creation through critical thinking, self-generated goals, and forging their own path.\nAt a young age, we transcend the need for physical survival. We don\u2019t have to worry about it as much. This is where something more dangerous comes into play: conceptual survival or surviving the idea of who you are.\nThis is easily noticeable across religion, politics, and niche communities like coffee drinkers. If you are conditioned into a religious belief system, you will feel threatened when someone challenges those beliefs. Like a mouse in the binds of a snake, you will lash out and attempt to reproduce the ideas in your head by telling them they are wrong.\nRepublicans and Democrats are in a war of opposing ideas they are attached to. They feel physically threatened when someone challenges their beliefs.\nIf your favorite sports team loses, or somebody says they\u2019re a bad team, how do you feel? Is your survival actually at stake? Or do you not see how silly you are being over a fabricated idea?\nWhen you gain weight, do you stress about the physical weight on your body? Or do you stress that the idea of your identity as a healthy individual will die?\nYou are surviving and reproducing your identity through words and actions in every situation. If you did not create yourself, you are furthering the spread of mindlessness, evil, and destruction without even knowing it. And you probably don\u2019t even care.\nIf we want to create an identity that works less, earns more, enjoys life, and has its ideas ripple through the Universe to create heaven, it will be painful.\nThink of your \u201cself\u201d as an intellectual structure. A house but not a home. When you go to remodel a house, you don\u2019t rip the foundation out and watch it fall. You make small and strategic changes as you become aware of problems that ruin the aesthetic and function of the house.\nTo change who you are, you must solve problems in alignment with the goals you create, not the ones that are assigned to you.\nThat\u2019s how you live with purpose.\nStart superficial so you can stop living in a narrow-minded state of stress. Fix your health, fix your money problems, fix your relationships, and then dive into the depths of your ever-evolving purpose.\nMost people don\u2019t \u201cfind their purpose\u201d because they don\u2019t see the purpose staring them in the face. You must solve the burning problems that are preventing your mind from expanding beyond surface-level living.\nYou do not have one purpose.\nYou move from lesser to greater purposes with time, effort, and evolution of who you are.\nVI \u2013 The Game\nLife is like a video game.\nI enjoy making the connection between life and the MMORPG World Of Warcraft that I spent a bit too much time playing as a teen.\nIn the game, you are prompted with a series of choices and tutorials.\nYou choose your race\nYou choose your class\nYou choose your appearance\nYou are launched into your relative starting zone\nYou are taught the fundamentals, rules, and mechanics of the game\nYou practice, level up a few times, and begin your journey as the main character\nYou unlock skills, traits, profession options, dungeons for specific loot, and the abilities to join a guild and travel faster with flight\nAll of these choices determine the opportunities available to you and whether you will enjoy playing the game or not. You may not like playing a support role, but you may love playing a tank and leading the group.\nIn real life, we can make the choice to start our game over at any point.\nWe can change who we are, what we pursue, and stack the resources that allow us to achieve that reality \u2013 like skills, a network, and our environment.\nIn a video game, there are NPCs, or Non-Player Characters.\nThese are people who are programmed to simply exist in the game. They have zero conscious thought. You can interact with them, but they stay the same for the entirety of the game. They never level up.\nWe learn and learn and learn from our parents, teachers, and friends, who learned from their parents, teachers, and friends, who were influenced by their life path, culture, and society. Schools, governments, and religious institutions rank the highest in authority and are often the first sources of information you are exposed to when seeking an answer to solve your problems. To be good in school, society, and religion, you must wash your mind with the teachings of school, society, and religion. A social fabric that relies solely on itself to make sense. Groundless, but necessary. A tool, not a master.\nThrough social conditioning, most people remain NPCs playing the game they were programmed to play.\nFrom a macro perspective, this \u201cmetagame\u201d is society.\nFrom a micro perspective, everything is a mind game.\nEvery situation has a series of goals, problems, and paths in between that every individual perceives according to their identity or perspective.\nIf you can mold your mind to see a situation for what it is, a game, by creating your own goal, constructing a path to get there, and deciphering the most advantageous actions you can take, even mundane situations can become enjoyable.\nGames are enjoyable because they focus the mind and eliminate distractions that can replicate until you reach a state of boredom or anxiety.\nGames present a descending series of goals each presenting a certain level of challenge.\nIf your skill doesn\u2019t match the challenge that the game presents, you\u2019re in for a bad time. If your skill is high and the challenge low, you will get bored. If your skill is low and the challenge is high, you will get anxious. When the challenge is just above your skill level, but you have absolute confidence in your ability to execute, you tap into what is arguably the most enjoyable point in the human experience (that is accessible without drugs, herbs, or other external compounds, of course).\nTo create enjoyment in your life, you must create macro and micro games.\nThe macro game of your life is your vision as the goal, life\u2019s work as the path, and micro games as the way to level up along the way.\nMicro games are everyday situations. You must approach every situation with an open mind, create your own goal, and attempt to win the games that are conducive to your vision. Everything else is a distraction. Do not play those games. And if you do, learn from them fast.\nVII \u2013 The Lens\nYou are a perspective vessel in a subjective reality. You have the ability to shift that perspective beyond a narrow identity to view situations from a higher, more holistic perspective that encapsulates the background, foreground, and detail of the situation.\nPerspective is like a DSLR camera.\nThe camera itself has its limits due to how it is programmed.\nYou can attach different lenses to the camera to capture a situation in a way that influences how the image is perceived based on your intention with the shot.\nIn the real world, your \u201clenses\u201d are ideologies or perspectives like religious beliefs, diet guidelines, business models, and relationship dynamics. Most people have one lens stuck to their camera for life. They will never see the big picture and get at the truth. Your job is to be like a shapeshifter. Study multiple perspectives and collect the lenses that allow you to see the world from a multitude of perspectives. This is how you stop reacting so much and take the actions that are best for your future.\nThe field of view of the camera is your field of awareness.\nWhen you zoom in and focus on one thing, the background blurs. This creates focus in your practical life and eliminates distractions.\nBut staying in this narrow focus limits your creativity. At times, you must zoom out to gather truths, patterns, and creative resources. Then, you can zoom back in to apply them to your practical life.\nYou, at this very moment in time, are a manifestation of your past mental, physical, financial, and spiritual choices. Who you want to become is a manifestation of the choices you make at this moment, and the next, until it all comes to an end.\nTo make better decisions, you can\u2019t go through life as a mindless robot.\nYou must pause, gain perspective, perceive the situation from a place of non-reaction, and make the best choice that actualizes your ideal future.\nIf the good life is created by a series of high-quality decisions, and high-quality decisions only come from improvement after low-quality decisions, then it is in your best interest to fail hard and often with a smile on your face.\nGiven the same amount of time, a person who makes 100 decisions regardless of how they feel will make exponentially more progress than the person who makes 1 decision because they are a slave to their thoughts.\nThe default state of consciousness is chaos.\nUnless your mind is engaged with a thought, task, or stimulus it will wander off in a negative direction. Anxiety or boredom. When we allow randomness into our lives, negativity increases in potential.\nFor every good thought, there are 100 negative thoughts if you do not have the purpose, path, or priority in alignment with your ideal future to ground your attention.\nI can fantasize about making a lot of money, but if I don\u2019t have clarity, my mind will wander to stressful bills, work, student loans, and those thoughts will splinter into more until you are drowning in overwhelm.\nThe path out is the path of mastery.\nThe utter dedication to creating the best life for yourself through self-education, skill acquisition, and daily practice.\nThe closed-minded quick-fix attitude toward life is the greatest trap of our times, and it runs much deeper than the average person believes. Which is ironic, because the reason they think they aren\u2019t a victim of closed-mindedness is closed-mindedness in itself.\nMost people close their minds at the first hint of difficulty.\nMasters embrace difficulty because they\u2019ve experienced the pattern it presents: The Perception Threshold or \u201crunner\u2019s high.\u201d\nWhen you stick through the increasing difficulty of a situation, eventually you break through to a state of enjoyment. This occurs in the macro and micro.\nYou don\u2019t need a quick fix to learn to walk, speak, or brew your favorite coffee. Those came from necessity and interest even though they are as difficult as learning any other skill.\nSince you don\u2019t treat your ideal future as a necessity or interest, situations become more difficult than they are. Don\u2019t fight with it, flow with it.\nVIII \u2013 The Formula\nMost people stop learning after graduation.\nThis is dangerous. You get trapped completing repetitive tasks. Life stays the same. You get bored. The cure is to learn, build, and discover your way into an interesting life.\nIt is impossible to change in the known.\nThe same routines. The same job. The same physical, mental, and digital environments. The same identity. The same perspective.\nIf you feel lost, the solution is counterintuitive.\nThrow yourself into the unknown and become even more lost. Move locations. Read new books. Acquire new skills to change careers or build your own business.\nForce yourself into a place where you can gain clarity and interest. Then, discover your way out.\nIf you aren\u2019t interested in anything, it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t in the unknown. You don\u2019t have a chance at finding your interests.\nIn order to do this well, you need:\nAn anti-vision and vision to create the frame of your perspective.\nA purpose to provide a lens to perceive situations and identify problems.\nA path to bring clarity to your education, skill acquisition, and building.\nA priority to focus on every single day and ground your attention.\nAll of these create a mind that is protected from distractions and expands with each level you reach.\nThe Anti-Vision & Vision\nFirst, become brutally aware of 2 things: (1) What you don\u2019t want. (2) Where you will end up if you keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing. Observe the masses and see where mindless action leads. It\u2019s not pretty.\nIt\u2019s easier to know what you don\u2019t want \u2013 from reflection and experience \u2013 than it is to know what you want. You can understand what you don\u2019t want to provide insight into what you do want.\nThis is an iterative process.\nWhat you think you want now can change in a year, month, or week. But you will never realize that without making mistakes. Mistakes are your compass toward a better life.\nTo create your anti-vision and vision, start with these questions:\nWhat does an unfulfilling day look like to you?\nWhat does your ideal day look like?\nWhat kind of person would you avoid as a significant other?\nWhat is your ideal version of a significant other?\nHow do you not want to look, feel, and act?\nHow do you want to look, feel, and act?\nHow much money is too little to sustain your lifestyle? Why is it too little?\nWhat won\u2019t you be able to do with that money?\nWhat environment would you hate living in? Why?\nWhat is your ideal environment?\nGet specific with these.\nWrite these down in a journal or notebook and add to them as inspiration strikes.\nPurpose, Path, Priority\nYour purpose is the most pressing problem in your life right now.\nThe one you\u2019ve been putting off solving.\nYour life\u2019s purpose is the big problem you want to solve in the world, but most people don\u2019t have the personal, professional, or social development to pursue that. Purpose evolves from superficial to metaphysical and you cannot skip steps.\nBefore you go off to solve big problems in the world, you must solve the big problems in your life.\nHealth, wealth, and relationships are where your burning problems exist. Fix them. That alone will open up room for curiosity, creativity, and consciousness because your mind is not plagued with the stress of survival.\nYour path is a hierarchy of goals that evolves with time in alignment with your evolving purpose.\nThere are skills, education, and knowledge you must acquire to reach a new level of mind. This is a never-ending path. The path of mastery.\nDeconstruct each domain of your life \u2013 health, wealth, and relationships \u2013 into a path to uncover the small, priority actions you must take to create a better life. You don\u2019t have to focus on them all at once, but you will need to improve them all eventually. Wealth and relationships can only improve as much as your health and vice versa.\nYour priority will involve learning or building for a dedicated time block every day. This is discussed in more depth in The Project chapter.\nAlong your journey, let curiosity be your guide into the icebergs of opportunity that life presents. Curiosity is the fuel along your path. As you are pushing into the unknown, novel information will grab your attention. These can be your best friend or worst enemy.\nThere are 4 paths you can take to pursue your curiosity further.\nAppreciation \u2013 appreciate the ideas, people, and opportunities that you encounter. You don\u2019t have to judge or project. Appreciate them for what they are.\nUnderstanding \u2013 you can seek to understand the opportunities deeper. This requires immersing yourself in books, content, and information relevant to that area.\nMastery \u2013 Once you understand something, you can then choose to master it. When you feel the pull to go deeper, don\u2019t suppress it.\nMonetization \u2013 When you go all in on a select few areas, you can pair those skills and interests with business principles to create a living out of it.\nDive into the unknown by pursuing your vision-aligned hierarchy of goals. Educate yourself to gain clarity, execute the smallest priority task, and keep an open mind to discover new potentials for your life.\nIX \u2013 The Shift\nWe are living through what seems to be a second Golden Age. The formal education system is being challenged by independent educators, journalists, experts, and artists that sought to remove the cap from their salary and physical reach. The banking system is being challenged by decentralized currency programmers. The government is being challenged by remote work and the desire for multi-nation citizenship to pay less taxes.\nWhen I was a child, I felt alone. I felt like I couldn\u2019t relate to my peers. They all obeyed their parents, teachers, and conformed to their friends without questioning whether or not it was the right decision. They went to school, got a job, and from that point forward you never heard anything interesting from them again.\nFormal education has its place, but people are losing trust in its ability to secure their future. It\u2019s all too common for people to invest 4-12 years and tens of thousands of dollars after 12 prior years of public schooling to be left with close to nothing but a piece of paper.\nFor those who want fulfilling work and an open schedule, a job isn\u2019t going to give it to you. I realized this after:\nSpending 5 years at University\nHaving 2 years left to complete my degree\nTaking out $20,000 in loans even when I had a \u201cfull ride\u201d scholarship\nKnowing I wanted to create my own path \u2013 getting a job was the bane of my existence\nDiscovering my love for web development after taking an introductory course out of curiosity\nLearning the entire course curriculum through self-education in less than a month\nUsing my self-study to get a high-paying tech job after my first interview (after multiple business failures and accepting that I had to get a job to survive)\nThe reality of formal education slapped me in the face.\nIf I could learn more useful skills in 6 months of self-education than I could in 5 years of formal education, why hadn\u2019t I done that earlier?\nIf I could get a better higher-paying job than most of the population through my own studies, that would eventually transfer over into a hyper-profitable business, why did I waste so much time in college?\nThis introduces the importance of deep knowledge.\nCuriosity is the path to doing the things you want to do. Curiosity is what makes you, you, and that is a necessity heading into the future of automated work. If you learn the same thing as everyone else to be trained into the select few jobs that are left, you can be replaced by almost anyone. The solution is deep knowledge.\nI like to think of deep knowledge as a \u201czip file\u201d for the mind.\nWith the formal education system nearing its end, as all things do, I\u2019m convinced that the future of schooling will be done online, with creators as teachers, and each student can join the \u201cschool\u201d that aligns the most with their interests, values, and preferred method of learning. One school system wouldn\u2019t dominate their childhood and early adulthood.\nStudents would evolve from creator to creator according to the deep knowledge they provide in their courses, mentorships, and content as decentralized schools.\nDeep knowledge is information that gradually raises the level of mind of the student. It helps them solve a sequence of problems toward a meaningful hierarchy of goals.\nThe future of work is being created right before our eyes.\nYou have the ability to create your own career through the acquisition and distribution of deep knowledge. Because the future demands that we earn with our mind, not our time.\nYou must solve your own problems, from superficial to metaphysical, to increase the value you have to offer to the world.\nThe internet is one big community. Your ancestors were entrepreneurs within their own communities. Everyone fulfilled a role that they were best suited for.\nEntrepreneurship is modern survival and the internet is your hunting ground. You hunt for deep knowledge by pursuing your curiosity. Dopamine is your compass, and you will need to break free of your drip-fed dopamine sedation of quick pleasures for this to make sense.\nX \u2013 The New Rich\nNobody said they wanted to work forty-plus hours a week, numb their mind with mindless entertainment, and put off their dreams just to wake up one day wondering where the time went. Yet that\u2019s what everyone does.\nThe word \u201cwork\u201d creates a cascade of stressful thoughts and emotions about what people have to do tomorrow, and the next day, forever until their life ends.\nPeople don\u2019t realize that work is a necessary part of life. It brings contrast to rest. Everyone wants to spend the majority of their life sipping coconuts on the beach, but when they have free time on their hands, they are arguably the most miserable. They don\u2019t realize that work brings order to the mind. The concept of a \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d doesn\u2019t cross the minds of the mindless masses.\nYour life\u2019s work is an inherent part of your vision for the future. It is how you spread the impact of the value you develop over time to others and, with the power of the internet, it has never been so feasible.\nYou must create space for your life\u2019s work through intentional lifestyle design. If you don\u2019t take the time, it will be taken from you.\nIn a world where 80-hour workweeks are encouraged, high-pressure environments are abundant, and little time is given for rest and recovery, you must fight back.\nFour-hour workdays, singular focus, and meaningful work are becoming the norm in small pockets of the internet, and for good reason. Ancient Romans and Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an ever-growing list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attribute their success to surprisingly low work times accompanied by an abundance of restful activities like long walks.\nMost people see successful creatives and assume they work longer than the average employee. This is false. Most of the world\u2019s most impactful creatives worked for an amount of time that would make your jaw drop, because they understood that focus is finite and creativity demands a lack of narrow focus on work. Rest opens your focus to allow your mind to register new ideas and solutions.\nTo start your lifestyle design, follow this process:\nPull out a notebook\nWrite down exactly what you are doing and why you do it at every minute of the day\nWrite down exactly how you feel in the morning, afternoon, and night\nPrioritize, remove, and restructure your day in a way that allows you to feel better and have more time \u2013 this requires honesty with yourself\nCreate a weeklong system to reverse entropy in your daily routine\nPlan out your morning routine, focused work routine, other tasks and meetings, and your nightly routine\nOver the next week, go back to your notebook and begin iterating on things that don\u2019t work in your system\nTo ensure maximum mental output, creativity, and life enjoyment there are 3 things to consider: how you fill your mind, how you empty your mind, and how you use your mind.\nIt is up to you to create a daily system with time and practice, but you should incorporate these 3 areas throughout the activities in your day.\nFill your mind \u2013 you need education, ideas, and novel resources you can apply toward your goals. This leads to intrinsic motivation.\nEmpty your mind \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be trapped in a chaotic bubble of thoughts and useful ideas. That\u2019s exactly how you make zero progress. Write things down.\nUse your mind \u2013 you need a vessel to focus your efforts. With your ideas and the clarity to execute, build your future.\nWe understand the importance of filling our minds with creative firepower and emptying our minds to allow space for creative emergence. Now we need to learn how to focus that creativity into our work.\n4 hours of focused work is better than 8 hours of distracted work.\nWhen I was a kid, I heard about The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferris. For some reason, the notion of a \u201c4-Hour Work Day\u201d stuck in my head throughout my young adulthood.\nThis alone changed the direction of my life.\nI perceived anything more than 4 hours of work a day as a problem\nI didn\u2019t label the lifestyle I wanted to achieve as impossible\nThis forced my mind to work on a creative solution whenever I worked longer than 4 hours\nI was able to notice opportunities in business that allowed me to work 2 hours a day while everyone else worked 8-12 hour days doing the same thing\nFor most people, the 4-hour workday isn\u2019t a possibility right now. Not because you\u2019ll have to work longer at the start, but because you\u2019ll have to work shorter.\nIf you have a job, spouse, or family it is obvious that you will need to start small and prioritize your work. Start with a 1-hour workday and as you get results, increase to a 4-hour work day.\nWhy 4 hours? Because from personal experience, scientific studies, and anecdotes from the world\u2019s most respected creatives, 3-5 hours is a sweet spot for mental energy expenditure.\n4 hours as a deadline creates the frame of a game that you can play to win. If you play the character of someone who only works 4 hours, and you\u2019ve internalized that trait, then you will feel the pressure to complete your work within that time.\nEven better, when you chunk that work session up into smaller time blocks, you create a powerful environment to narrow your focus into a productive state of good stress.\nIf you can spend 8 hours building someone else\u2019s dreams, you can spend 1 hour building your own.\nXI \u2013 The Skill Stack\nThe state of work is changing. Specialists are out, but so are generalists. We live in a time of specialized generalism. You must pursue your curiosity, become obsessed with one crevice of reality, stack skills to solve burning problems within that domain, and let the base of your skill tree spread its roots into other connected domains.\nBecoming a specialist is a great way to get replaced in this Digital Renaissance. Pigeon-holing yourself into one skill is not the path to independent success.\nIf you become a specialist, you can work for someone else for a pretty paycheck, but you don\u2019t realize that they are the reason you can get paid. You can\u2019t create an independent income because you haven\u2019t learned those skills that allow you to get paid.\nBig businesses have marketing, sales, operations, and other departments that all serve a role in acquiring customers and delivering their products.\nThere are no limits, aside from pleasurable distractions, to what you can learn and apply as one person. Individuals can learn design, marketing, writing, and video to run a multimillion-dollar business selling a solution to the problem they\u2019ve solved in their lives.\nThanks to deep knowledge being accessible to those who want to find it on the internet, you can become top 10% in any skill with 6-12 months of focused effort. When you combine the skills we will discuss below, your opportunity surface area compounds.\nThe Message & Medium\nIt is impossible to achieve your version of success without value exchange. You must become a vessel of valuable information and exchange it for your desired form of value in relationships, business, and everyday life.\nIn other words, if you want to make money (the form of value you want) then you have to exchange your own form of value for someone that has money. It isn\u2019t just going to appear out of thin air.\nA valuable message is a way to communicate with others that is relatable, understandable, and actionable. This requires an understanding of human nature and psychology. The best way to do this is to learn marketing and sales \u2013 because they contain practical frameworks for understanding psychology with real-world practice.\nValue is determined by perception and perception is influenced by an individual\u2019s worldview. To spread valuable information with your message, it must be crafted for a group or individual\u2019s level of mind, identity, and conditioning.\nThere are certain words you can craft to capture, hold, and deliver value on attention. You must get people to focus on you, or else their focus will gravitate toward something more distracting or valuable.\nYour message must mimic the Universe:\nTell stories\nLead people through highs and lows\nSpark emotions like your favorite movies\nOpen a curiosity loop to capture attention\nAgitate a problem that then shapes their perspective\nRelate with them through personal experience\nImply a goal with a desirable end result\nProvide a path for them to follow to achieve that result\nValue is behavior change.\nThe medium by which you spread your message is writing or speaking.\nThere is content in consciousness and content in the collective consciousness. The front end of your mind is content in your conscious attention and the front end of the internet is content in the collective consciousness. The back end of your mind is the unconscious programming that shapes who you are and the back end of the internet is the programmed operating system that houses content.\nPutting content out into virtual reality is how you contribute to humanity through business.\nStart by learning to write. Harness psychology through marketing and sales and write a valuable message for the world to discover on the internet.\nConsistent writing helps your speaking. Writing is accessible to anyone. Everything on the internet starts with writing. Emails, posts, advertisements, video scripts, captions, direct messages, and more. Do not think that human psychology does not apply to any and all forms of writing regardless of where you write it.\nWriting, speaking, marketing, and sales are the foundational skills that will determine the results of any other skill you learn.\nResults Oriented Skills\nResults-oriented skills are how you apply your message and medium of choice. They are the vessel for distributing your value. The message and medium are evergreen, while results-oriented skills change with the landscape. You must keep your finger on the pulse of advancements in your interests so that you don\u2019t fade out as time progresses.\nAt this point in time, results-oriented skills are digital. We don\u2019t live in a world where the printing press was just invented and profitable skills revolved around that. We live in a digital world.\nThese results-oriented skills are subject to change, but email marketing, graphic design, videography, photography, editing, animation, artificial intelligence, and social media are a few that allow us to apply our message to the current landscape with our medium of choice.\nThese skills are not only useful for your business but for others. All brands, creators, and students have problems that they want solved in their personal and professional lives. When you stack results-oriented skills with evergreen skills, you can practice on your own business or create a product or service to use those skills to grow someone else\u2019s.\nIf you invest the time it would take to get a degree in building an email list of 50,000 like-minded readers, that\u2019s twice the capacity of what a professional football stadium can hold. Now, if you craft a persuasive message, write a few emails, and promote a product that you\u2019ve created as a solution to your own problems, I would not be surprised if you made the average United States salary in a month, minimum.\nXII \u2013 The Project\nOne pattern I\u2019ve noticed in my life is that I\u2019ve always carved out time to build something of my own. Things like schoolwork, client work, and even projects assigned to me on a job were necessary, but they didn\u2019t bring me the fulfillment I was looking for.I realized that the source of most people\u2019s lack of fulfillment is that they\u2019ve never learned or built something that they chose to learn or build.\nThe inputs and outputs of one\u2019s mind were enslaved since birth with the conventional life path. Learn this. Build that. To the point where people hate the only two things that will free them from that enslavement. If you don\u2019t make a choice, society chooses for you.\nHaving a perpetual stream of evolving personal projects to work on first thing brought novelty to my days. The discoveries, insight, and progress that I made across multiple domains were the source of my zest for life.\nA project is a tangible hierarchy of goals that orders the mind, and you are the infinite project. You are your life\u2019s work. You are a project that houses projects each with a purpose, path, and priority that when actualized, allows you to evolve. A project is how you throw an anchor in the unknown and pull yourself through a difficult current of learning experiences to complete the project.\nThe source of learning is struggle, not memorization. Learning is the process of turning knowledge into understanding, and the lowest points of your life are those where a stackable lesson presents itself, but only if you apply it in reality.\nProjects help you frame what you learn. They allow you to pursue a goal, hit a roadblock, and frame your mind from the accompanying problem. Only from there can you truly learn something useful that can be instantly applied.\nTo learn information with efficiency:\nDon\u2019t start learning first\nCreate a project for the goal you want to achieve\nCreate a path or system to achieve that goal\nStart building the project in the real world with what you know\nTeach people about what you are building (this can be friends, family, or internet peers)\nIdentify knowledge gaps when you can\u2019t build further or articulate your thoughts\nStudy deep knowledge to fill those knowledge gaps\nReturn to building and teaching\nRepeat forever\nThis learning process utilizes novelty, pattern recognition, and self-experimentation to maximize the flow of information you experience.\nMost people learn and learn and learn just to start over when it comes time to build, because they realize that everything they\u2019ve learned has no direct use in the project they began. They don\u2019t have a goal-specific lens to interpret their learnings from.\nThe only way to solve your problems for good is through self-experimentation.\nSelf-experimentation is the opposite of blind trust in a theory, guru, belief system, ideology, how-to advice, or dogma. It is the only way to discover what truly works for you and your infinitely unique needs.\nFor any given problem, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of options available to you to solve it. Limiting yourself to the one or two that you know may not solve your problem.\nYour job is to:\nResearch a plethora of solutions to your problem\nTest them all without latching onto one\nNote principles, patterns, and truths between them\nNote what gets you results, but may not get others\u2019 results\nBegin to create your own solution with what you\u2019ve learned\nThis is where true value is cultivated. This value can be used for profit or just to make your life better.\nIf you have relationship problems: try going on a retreat, hiring a therapist, reading a book with advice, or working on it directly with your partner.\nIf you have money problems: try creating a budget, starting a side business, or improving your skillset to get a higher-paying job.\nIf you have health problems, try fad diets like carnivore or keto, study nutrition principles, and immerse yourself in information from all sources until you understand the full puzzle.\nDon\u2019t be discouraged if the important problems in your life aren\u2019t solved in an instant.\nXIII \u2013 The Vessel\nEveryone is an entrepreneur; some just choose to get paid for the problems they solve in their personal life.\nAll profitable products start as a project whether the intention to sell is there or not. If you want to generate a creative independent income to free yourself from society\u2019s chains, you will need to sell a valuable product. And what\u2019s a better starting point than a personal project that solves a burning problem that all living beings encounter?\nSelf-improvement is about solving problems in your life. Business is about solving problems in other people\u2019s lives. Stop overcomplicating how to make money. Stop trying to solve creative problems that don\u2019t exist. Acquire the skills to solve the problems in your life \u2013 which is an automatic filter for value \u2013 then turn the solution into a product for others.\nThere are 4 eternal markets in business: health, wealth, relationships, and happiness. These are where all burning problems and meaningful goals exist in your life and in others. Solve your own problems and sell the solution.\nHow to start a billion-dollar company: Don\u2019t. Instead, start as one person. If you can\u2019t turn your interests into income, you don\u2019t have the skill to start a business that requires 10 times the resources.\nYou, as an individual, have the ability to attract an audience to your work and put a valuable product in front of them.\nThis is where most people start complicating modern business. They say you need to \u201cniche down\u201d and target an audience that you probably don\u2019t care to work with. Modern business advice is a surefire way to end up in another line of work that you hate.\nLet\u2019s tie this all together with a simple statement:\nThe most profitable niche is you.\nYour purpose is your brand. Your path is your product. Your priorities are your content. Your content contains the valuable message that attracts people to your brand. When you occasionally put your product in front of them, that\u2019s how you start to generate an independent income.\nWhat is more \u201cniche\u201d than your combination of skills and interests that you learned on the path toward your goals?\nEveryone has the same big goals of making more money, having more sex, having more energy, and ending their existential angst.\nWhile the goals are the same, the path you will take is different. If myself and another have the goal of making money, we are both going to research and experiment with different things. I may try e-commerce or digital products while they try budgeting and starting a brick-and-mortar business.\nBy pursuing your goals, solving your problems through self-experimentation, turning personal projects into products, and spreading a valuable message to attract people with a similar identity as you, I see it as very difficult to not make as much money as you please with time and iteration.\nIf you are the niche, saturation ceases to exist. Everyone will have a unique product that serves people at their level of mind and helps raise the collective consciousness.\nThe fate of humanity is not guaranteed. The evolution of the collective is only as powerful as the individuals that comprise it. It is for that reason that our evolution depends on the individuals you and I create through the reproduction of information born from conscious personal progress.\nTurning yourself into a business is how you reproduce on a spiritual level. It is how you shape the development of selves across the globe and contribute to humanity.\nWhile most people spread information that holistically leads to evil and destruction, you can seek to solve problems \u2013 from superficial to metaphysical \u2013 and become a massive value creator.\nTo reiterate the entirety of this path:\nUnderstand and experience the patterns of The Universe\nExperience the full range of the human experience\nAlign your decisions with the perspective of your ideal self\nPursue a hierarchy of goals and solve the true problems in your life\nFrom an elevated level of mind, use your creative ability to build holistic projects that contribute to humanity\nHunt for ideas and build with your own two hands. Make the immaterial material. Turn dirt into gold. Become a fountainhead of value in a world that is desperate for depth.\nAt the root of it all, leave your dent in the world through The Art of Focus.\nIf you\u2019d like to grab a physical copy of the book, you can do so here."

It comes with:\nThe Keepsake Hardcover \u2013 we are only printing 2000 copies.\nThe digital download of the book so you can be the first to read.\nThe audiobook version when it is recorded and uploaded.\nThe FOCI Planner to deconstruct your ideal future into priority tasks.\nThe FOCI Coin to remember to act with intention.\nThe Digital Transformation Center with 12 hours of modern entrepreneurship training.\nThe Private Community for updates, discussion, and networking.\nA private invitation to an in-person event in Phoenix, AZ next year.\nPreorder your copy here before October 24, 2023.\nAnd a special shoutout to Jack Moses for seeing how the newsletters pieced together to create a cohesive book on The Universe, lifestyle design, creating your ideal self, and finding purpose in modern business (when it seems full of sleazy marketing on the surface).\nThe Bane Of My Existence: The Conventional Career Path\nOne thing that I was truly excited to do was go to college. I knew that it would give me a chance to let me try new things, meet new people, and ultimately:\nDelay the amount of time I had to build a sustainable income source for myself.\nThe minute that I set foot on the ASU campus I knew that I had started a timer.\nIt was do or die.\nI had to learn the skills necessary to make an income without a job, or end up the same as everyone else. If I had to get a job, I knew that 8-hour days and energy-draining work would leave little room for me to break free of that job.\nI was hell-bent on trying different business models.\nIn freshman year, I started a fitness YouTube channel with my buddy who lived in the dorm room 3 doors down from mine.\nWe made workout videos, educational videos, and food challenges (my 10,000 calorie challenge video got around 20,000 views which excited me).\nAfter a few months, we decided to call it quits. I didn\u2019t do much else during freshman year aside from partying, playing video games, taking graphic design, marketing, film, and other classes to see what I was truly interested in.\nAround that time, my group of friends and I were arrested for smoking weed in the parking structure across from our dorm building. I got to take a ride with the not-so-kind police officer, give him my fingerprints, and have him interrogate me about where I got the weed (funny story that we\u2019ll dive into another time).\nThis is an important turning point in my life. I had forgotten about my goal of avoiding the conventional career path. When I went home for the summer, I got a letter from the court in the mail that gave me 2 options:\nGo to court, defend my case, and possibly be a convicted felon\nPay $5-$10,0000 for a program that made me pee in a cup every week for 3-6 months.\nThis scared the crap out of me. I hid the letter from my parents and dealt with my emotional turmoil in silence.\nThis was the moment I purchased The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I glued my eyes to the page hoping it would ease some of my suffering \u2014 and it did. This was one of the times when I genuinely stopped caring. I let go. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen.\nI regained that drive to blaze my own path, started making YouTube videos again (talking head videos, kind of like Elliot Hulse at the time), and continued learning about spirituality along the way.\nAs with every other business model I tried, it didn\u2019t work out.\nFailing, Failing, and Failing Again\nIn my sophomore year of college, I picked up photography. I watched YouTube videos like mad to educate myself, used my summer job money to buy a camera, and shot pics of whatever I could. Skyscrapers downtown, landscapes after a long hike, macro shots of nature.\nI didn\u2019t really care for taking pictures, what I really loved was editing. That realization shot me down a Photoshop learning rabbit hole and come junior year of college I committed to posting some of my edits on Instagram.\nI spent 6-8 hours at a time glued to my computer working to actualize a surreal image I had in my head. These were some of the results:\nMost of these were just mashups of stock images, some had my own photos (like the buildings and plane).\nI never planned to make an income from this \u2014 but I ended up gaining around 2,500 followers on Instagram. I got bored of the whole digital art thing after a few months, but it taught me the importance of graphic design, visual storytelling, and opened my mind to the possibility of growing on social media with quality content.\nIf I had the awareness I do now, I could have easily created a course teaching people how to make these compositions.\nThat same year, I tried a few more business models.\n1) A Facebook Ads Agency\nI bought a course that taught me the fundamentals of landing clients, creating Facebook ads, and advertising local businesses.\nI gave up after sending around 50 cold emails and never landing a client after 2-3 sales calls.\nLooking back, this taught me about funnels and direct response marketing. A key component to making any business work. I just didn\u2019t have the patience.\n2) A Rave Clothing Dropshipping Store\nI went to my first rave and was exposed to the whole EDM scene in my sophomore year (hence my obsession with dubstep for focused work and gym music). I knew the industry like the back of my hand and knew there was a demand for fancy (and skimpy) clothes. Especially during \u201cfestival season.\u201d\nI bought an eCom course that taught me branding, copywriting, Shopify, and how to find \u201cgood products.\u201d\nI used my previous Facebook ads knowledge, spent about $100 on ads, and made one sale of a shiny bra (lol).\nThe first online dollar felt amazing, but I felt like a piece of garbage having people wait 30 days for the product to be shipped from China.\nMy skills were starting to stack.\nI had a solid understanding of design, marketing, copywriting, sales, and branding. Things started to make sense.\n3) Freelance Web Design\nThis is where things get spicy. At this time \u2014 in senior year \u2014 I was living with 6 other guys in an old frat house. Yes\u2026 6 guys in one house. There were 2 master bedrooms that people split.\nSometimes I miss those days. There was always something interesting going on. A truly unique group of people that all got along.\nI took an introduction to web development course that launched me into an entirely new phase of life. I fell in love with coding. I skipped class, studied Udemy courses, took free coding classes, and ended up learning the entire college course curriculum in about a month. I didn\u2019t show up to 95% of the classes and was still top of that class.\nThis taught me the absolute necessity of a self-education habit for those who want to do their own thing in life.\nDeep study and deep work have to be a daily thing. You can\u2019t skip it. The only other option is to be assigned distractions or the work of others to fill that time.\nPart of the reason I loved coding so much is that I knew I could freelance with that skill and at minimum get a high-paying job whether I graduate or not. The tech industry was rather lenient when it came to needing a degree.\nI tried my hand at freelancing, reached out to friends and family, built some portfolio sites, and landed a few cheap clients (I made around $500 total).\nThat was senior year \u2014 my time was running out.\nI had to make something work or succumb to my fate of \u201cgetting a real job.\u201d\n4) Two Ecommerce Brands\nI decided to combine my branding, web development, graphic design, and advertising skills into one and create a real brand.\nI knew that developers were stuck at a screen all day \u2014 and this is around the time blue light glasses were gaining mainstream popularity \u2014 so I called my dad.\n\u201cHey pops\u2026 question for ya\u2026 can I uhhhhhh borrow a few thousand dollars? I promise I\u2019ll pay you back, here\u2019s my entire plan for getting rich, makes sense right?\u201d\nMy dad probably thought I was insane, but he believed in me, something I am truly grateful for \u2014 not many have this opportunity. I couldn\u2019t waste it.\nI looked for the perfect product, ordered them, waited 30 days for them to show up, took product pictures, and started paying for ads and influencer shoutouts.\nHere\u2019s one of my ad images:\nYes. That\u2019s a hedgehog. His name was Momo. Very cuddly despite his spiky demeanor. He ended up getting sick \u2014 and after multiple efforts to syringe feed him to health \u2014 he passed away.\nRIP Momo.\nThe glasses were great. I was proud of the product. But I was just shoveling money down the drain on ads at this point. I learned about influencer promotions, paid a meme page to post an ad and had everyone in the comments calling me a \u201cclown.\u201d That hurt, I quit once again.\nThis sparked another major low point in my life, similar to when I got arrested.\nI had wasted my dad\u2019s money, maxed out my first credit card, and could not see the light. I was doomed.\nThe only logical option was to accept my fate, use my previously learned coding skills, and opt for plan B of getting a job.\nLuckily enough, I got a web design job fairly quickly. It was a cushy job that taught me about what it really takes to run a web design agency. I used my free time there to try to land clients and saw some success.\nNow that I had money coming in, I decided to try out another e-commerce brand. This time with minimalist wallets (that my friends and I still use to this day, they were top quality.)\nI even invested quite a bit in professional product pics:\nAgain\u2026 didn\u2019t make a sale, wasted money, and got tired of it.\nThis is when I went all-in on freelancing.\nThere was a blurry moment throughout all of this where I also tried an SEO agency, content marketing agency, and was still kinda trying to find clients for anything I could get my hands on, mostly web design.\nAll of the skills I had developed up until this point could not fail me.\nNothing Happens, Then Everything Happens\nEven though I had a decent-paying job, my inner child was still screaming at me to live up to my promise.\nI may not have been able to avoid a job altogether, but I could sure as hell get out of it before other life responsibilities started to pile up. A car, wife, children, and the rest would be my nail in the coffin. I had to get out immediately.\nI walked into local businesses, reached out to my network again, tried LinkedIn prospecting, and everything else.\nI was able to land 2-3 clients a month at $1500-$2500 from this.\nWhen I learned more about the businesses I was helping (mostly service businesses) I learned a bit about email marketing and copywriting.\nI also realized that the web design agency I worked at was only profitable because they had a marketing, sales, and operations department. The web designers were only one piece of the puzzle (keep that in mind freelancers, you have to learn it all).\nI pivoted my offer and started creating simple service funnels.\nA landing page, opt-in, and email sequence that would get calls booked for people like contractors, lawyers, accountants, pest control, and anyone else who were already getting leads but wanted to convert more into calls and customers.\nThis is when I started increasing my prices (because it was a more specific offer that got better results than just \u201cI\u2019ll build you a pretty website\u201d).\nI was charging $2500-$5000 to set this funnel up. It took me less time to build than it did a full-blown website. I was able to systemize my process. It was less \u201ccustom\u201d and more \u201cresults\u201d based on what has worked.\nA few months later, I decided to quit my job. I had the knowledge and skill. I had absolute confidence in my ability at this point.\nQuitting my job wasn\u2019t as exciting as I thought it would be\u2026 but the act of working toward that goal was deeply enjoyable.\nA few months later I discovered the power of Twitter, started posting content, and planned out a freelancing digital product while trying to land web design/funnel clients there. This is when my niche shifted towards creators, coaches, and freelancers. I knew them well, liked working with them, and could get them some killer results.\nOver the last 4 years, I built out products, pivoted my brand, tested different offers, and here we are now.\nThis is where the exponential growth started to kick in.\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n1) I hit 6 figures freelancing.\n4 years ago was the first time I hit 6 figures from my efforts.\nTechnically, it took 4-5 years of trial and error since my freshman year of college to reach that point. But I wasn\u2019t all too serious. I took too much time off and like cardio, your progress dissipates fast. You have to do it every day for life.\n2) I built out a freelancing course, grew my audience, and started making an extra $3,000 per month with my course (on top of client work).\n\u201cSolve your own problems and sell the solution\u201d is my mantra.\nI had so much freelancing knowledge by this point that it made sense to create a product around that. I could just have easily created a fitness product since I\u2019ve spent 10 years in the gym and obsessing over my nutrition.\nI only had 500 followers at this point.\nI made $3,000 a month because I was smart with networking. I got shared and reposted by developer accounts (people who had skills to freelance with) and self-improvement accounts (people who wanted to get out of their job).\nEven with 500 followers, I was leveraging accounts\u2019 audiences that added up to over 100,000. That\u2019s how I got traffic to my digital products and gained followers that would compound with time.\n3) I created a second digital product that taught how I create websites.\nThe freelancing product was a hit for my size and authority (not much).\n\u201cCreate your own customers\u201d is my second mantra.\nI had to create a bridge between my current product and the beginners I was attracting by talking about my other interests, like mindset and spirituality.\nI had to teach them a skill that they could freelance with.\n4) I hit 10,000 followers on Twitter and created a beginner social media digital product.\nNow that I had results with social media, I created a social media product.\nIt was a logical puzzle piece to my other products.\nYou can freelance on social media and avoid the pains of cold email and manual outreach by building an audience.\nI eventually bundled them all together into a product called Modern Money (lol).\n5) I launched a physical planner.\nI loved talking about productivity in my writing.\nAnd I\u2019ve always had an itch to create something physical.\nSo, I used my previous eCommerce failures to source and sell a physical planner.\nIt did well, but I hated shipping out of my own home. It was too time consuming.\nSo I turned it into a digital version and gave it away for free.\n6) I hit 6 figures in digital product sales in just over a year.\nWith multiple product launches and \u201cbullet spraying\u201d the market to see what worked, I was able to double down fast.\nMy 3 digital products made $100,000 in a little over a year.\n7) I pivoted my freelance offer into a marketing consulting offer.\nAt this point, I was kind of tired of web design and funnels.\nI had creators and coaches nearly begging me to consult them rather than do it for them. Creators often like to learn and do things themselves, so I leaned into that.\nI created a consulting program that taught marketing, sales, copywriting, offer creation and my simple service funnel to land more clients.\nThis freed up more time since I didn\u2019t have to do the work for them. I showed up for calls and communicated through a chat app like Telegram.\n8) I built Modern Mastery HQ.\nModern Mastery was the next stepping stone in my life\u2019s work.\nI spent two years of my life overloading it with all of the information I learned.\nI put all of my old products inside there to get people up to speed.\nThis taught me that growing a membership-based community is a long and slow grind.\nEveryone always asks me how to start a community because they think it\u2019s more profitable than a plain old digital product. It\u2019s hard\u2026 and it\u2019s not.\n9) I hit my first $50,000 month.\nWith Modern Mastery and my marketing/brand advising, I made my first $50,000 in one month.\nThis consisted of around 5 clients at $8,000 a piece and the rest was filled with Modern Mastery subscriptions.\n10) I built Digital Economics and 2 Hour Writer to create a foundation for my vision.\nOver the years I had some pretty insane results for myself and my clients.\nThe cool thing about this business is that my best clients became good friends.\nWith that, I was still annoyed by client work. I didn\u2019t like how much time it took out of my day. I had the results to productize, so I did.\nI built my Digital Economics masterclass with literally everything I\u2019ve ever learned. Then, I splintered 2 Hour Writer off from that and sold it as a lower ticket product to create a value ladder.\nEverything I\u2019ve built until this point allowed for my current products to form.\nMeaning, you can\u2019t create the perfect product, or even know what product to create, if you don\u2019t just create one at your current level.\nAll of my knowledge is going into my book.\nThe Power Planner failure will turn into a success with its relaunch with the book (you can preorder The FOCI Planner with the Keepsake Box).\nThe software I\u2019m building would not be possible without 4 years of writing and teaching writing as a skill.\nI had to evolve. Most people create a product and sell that for life. That\u2019s a great way to get stuck.\n11) I made $800,000 in 2022 writing 2 hours a day.\nAt the end of 2022, my brand started to reach exponential growth on all platforms.\nEverything started to align.\nMy products were solid just by the nature of evolution.\nMy audience (traffic) increased fast, so my income grew with it.\nThank goodness I was out of client work now because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to utilize that traffic.\nLesson: if you have a decent product that sells, focus the majority of your efforts on audience building and leverage. Diversify platforms, make sure you are growing, maybe even write a book for added depth and authority.\nI made a video on my writing process that allowed me to do this in 2 hours a day.\n12) I\u2019ve made $3,300,000 in a year.\nOnce I realized that all I needed was a growing readership and a product that helped others (so it sold, brought value to their lives, and spread by word of mouth), I knew what my levers were.\nI spent 2 hours every morning writing.\nWhen done right, this leads to both new products, readership growth, and maintenance of your business.\nBy staying consistent \u2013 and being sure that I was in fact growing my readership \u2013 exponential growth hit and my income stayed consistent with my growth.\n13) I\u2019m investing every cent I can into the success of my new company, Kortex.\nKortex is many things.\nAt its heart, it is a revolutionary software for writers, marketers, and creatives.\nThink of it as a note-taking app combined with a writing app to ensure that your writing is unique, impactful, and persuasive.\n(Say bye-bye to Notion and Obsidian being the \u201csecond brain\u201d apps of the creator economy when they don\u2019t serve the purpose of good writing that builds a readership.)\nFurther than that, it will also replace newsletter software, personal websites, and content scheduling apps for the majority of creators in future versions.\nThat is the software base. It is not ready for the public.\nWe are building an education backbone.\nAll Kortex subscribers get access to a library of strategies that is better than most courses you will find in the creator economy.\nIt is the only place you can hire me (and Justin Scott + Joey Justice) for consulting, a group mastermind, or ghostwriting to build your name with writing as a creator.\nIf you\u2019re interested in working with us, apply here.\nThe Overarching Lesson Of All Of My Teachings: Evolution Of Identity\nEvolution demands struggle, tension, conflict, and challenge.\nAs above, so below.\nWhen a star explodes, atomic nuclei fill the galaxy allow other forms to grow.\nWhen war breaks out among nations, technological advancements are made that have saved more lives than were lost.\nWhen you feel lost, you are nearing the end of a chapter in your life. You either find purpose or get consumed by the emotional turmoil you are trapped in.\nYou can\u2019t allow yourself to get complacent.\nThere is always a next mountain to climb, project to build, product to launch, writing to post.\nWhen you pursue and overcome challenges by solving problems, you are required to acquire the skillset and mindset to do so.\nWhen you pursue and achieve goals, your complexity of self increases.\nLife becomes meaningful because you have the experience to notice the things that the average individual can\u2019t.\nIf you don\u2019t know what to do, start a business.\nIt is one of the best vessels for personal and collective evolution.\nThat\u2019s my story.\nI hope you enjoyed it.\nDan Koe"

There are thousands like you that have turned their situation around.\nThe quality of your life one year from now will depend on the tiny choices that compound into that life.\nYou don\u2019t have to make perfect choices.\nIt\u2019s actually better if you make mistakes.\nThe greatest risk is no risk at all, because how else would you fail?\nWithout failure, improvement is literally impossible.\nWithout improvement, you don\u2019t have an aim for your life.\nWithout an aim for your life, everything becomes meaningless.\nBecoming a better person is how you live with purpose.\nBig Standards\nBroke people are okay with being broke until something catastrophic happens.\nAnd it is much more likely for a catastrophic event to happen to them.\nTheir car blows up because it\u2019s old and unmaintained.\nSomeone breaks into their house in a bad neighborhood.\nTheir parents get sick and they can\u2019t help because of their low income.\nOf course, they have some motivation to make money at this point, but they think it\u2019s too late when the catastrophic event happens. They didn\u2019t prepare.\nSo they get trapped in an endless cycle of \u201cI should\u2019ve started sooner.\u201d\nEventually, things equalize. The stress in their life lowers. They start to enjoy their mindless comforts again. Waiting for another catastrophe to break them down.\nSuccessful people use these events to change who they are.\nWho they are determines their standards and values.\nTheir standards and values determine the tiny choices they make.\nIf you\u2019re okay with having $5 in your bank account, you won\u2019t see that as a problem.\nIf you\u2019re okay with having $100,000 in your bank account, you will see anything less than that as a problem that needs to be fixed.\nProblems frame your perception \u2013 I talk about this in my book.\nYou begin to notice more money-making opportunities.\nYour Google searches change to things like \u201chow to make an extra $1,000/month.\u201d\nYou start having conversations about money with your friends.\nAll of these tiny choices begin to compound into results.\nYou rewire your thinking patterns based on your intentional search for specific information relating to the problem you are facing.\nThe information you consume highly impacts your identity and thus your standards.\nIf you surround yourself with people \u2013 physical or digital \u2013 that make it seem like it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d to be 100 pounds overweight, have zero money, work a job you hate, stay with a partner you despise, get drunk every night, and the rest\u2026 how do you think your life will end up?\nIf your standards require you to eat from Whole Foods, you will look at McDonald\u2019s meals in disgust.\nIf your standards require you to work like a CEO, you will look at low-level grunt work as a problem that must be fixed through skill acquisition, education, prioritization, and outsourcing.\nYou obviously can\u2019t solve all of the problems in your life immediately.\nYou can\u2019t escape your situation right now.\nYou need a plan.

And if you know why, why are you ignoring it?\nAre you advancing humanity by handing out 40 triple-pumped mocha cappuccinos working at Starbucks? Or are you making humanity sick and overweight?\nWhy haven\u2019t you begun pursuing a more purposeful career or starting a business?\nDo you know why you are shoveling food down your throat? Do you understand how each nutrient interacts with your biology and creates a healthy state?\nWhy haven\u2019t you begun educating yourself on health and training?\nYou live in your body. It should be considered your full-time job to learn about it.\nDo you know why you are going through the motions with a partner that was easy to get with? Do you see yourself with them for 40 more years?\nWhy haven\u2019t you improved your social skills to the point of being able to attract a better partner?\nIt\u2019s cliche, but you have one shot at this life thing.\nThe only person that can stop you from living a meaningless existence is yourself.\nThe Power Of The Internet\nLet\u2019s break down what creates better choices:\nLearning is the fundamental human drive.\nAt birth, you are an information sponge.\nYour parents, friends, society, teachers, and bosses all project their worldview on you.\nWhere did they get their worldview? From the same people, unless they questioned it.\nThis is all that you know.\nIf we could put a number on it, you know less than 1% of the information available in the world. Probably closer to less than 0.001%.\nThis information creates reference points in reality.\nIt is how you distinguish yourself from others.\nIt creates your identity.\nYour identity limits what information you notice, because you\u2019ve only learned so much. You won\u2019t notice certain things if you haven\u2019t learned the information that bridges what it is with what you know. You won\u2019t understand intermediate information if you haven\u2019t learned beginner information. You can\u2019t advance from level 1 to 3. You are missing out on 99% of life for this reason.\nIf I was exposed to the information and environment that made me goth, I would notice certain likes and dislikes in music, people, clothing, work opportunities, outlooks on the future, and emotional states.\nAs a goth, I won\u2019t notice or even care about profitable business opportunities to experiment with (assuming that I am the stereotypical loner goth who hates the world).\nIf I drowned myself in information to reprogram my identity over time, I would spot opportunities related to that identity.\nThis brings up the power of the internet.\nYou can tend a digital garden or be thrust into a digital swamp.\nWe\u2019ve never had access to so much information, and I find it hard to believe that it isn\u2019t shaping identities rapidly and for the worse.\nWhen you log on to social media, the default action is to follow entertaining accounts and meme pages.\nAlmost all of them subject your mind to unwanted tenants that party like it\u2019s a frat house. When the parents come home, they\u2019re devastated by what they see.\nYour awareness is the parents coming home after mindless ideas turn your mind into a swamp.\nBecome aware of this now.\nUnfollow anyone who does not serve the conditioning of better standards in your life. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it, and no matter how much you justify it, the people you follow subtly influence your actions. Slowly, then all at once you become someone you may hate.\nTake your time to follow valuable accounts. Valuable accounts challenge your worldview, make you think outside the box, and educate you on the skills necessary to reach a higher quality of life.\nThis is not an overnight process.\nYou may not find the information useful at first.\nIt takes time to bridge specific ideas that lead to understanding.\nYou will probably find it boring\u2026 until it\u2019s one of the most interesting things in the world.\nFollow one account.\nLet the algorithm do its work.\nFollow accounts that reply to the first account\u2019s posts.\nWith time, you will create an environment that is conducive to your growth.\nThe only difference between you and the person more successful than you is the consistent intention behind the information they consume.\n\u201cBut what about taking action???\u201d\nYou are acting every day.\nWhy?\nBecause your mind is programmed with the information conducive to those actions.\nYour identity is forged by the information you\u2019ve been fed, and that alone determines what you perceive as an opportunity to act.\nSurround yourself with the right people and you can achieve anything you want.\nThe Path Of The Value Creator\nWhy do people keep doing things they hate?\nI\u2019ve always wondered this.\nNot like I\u2019m a special little flower that never got stuck in the trap, but one who feels like he\u2019s escaped and can view the situation from higher up on the mountain until he inevitably falls back down.\nPraying for the weekend.\nDreading Monday morning.\nHiding who you are to make conversation with people you don\u2019t like working with.\nUsing the internet as an escape.\nScrolling, clicking, shutting your mind off for just a bit longer, because when it\u2019s on, you don\u2019t like what it\u2019s doing.\nThis is the life of the consumer.\nThe person who is used by the internet, rather than the one who uses it.\nThere\u2019s no escaping this new world.\nYou can fight it or flow with it.\nAnd while the internet is the problem, it\u2019s also the solution.\nYou do not have to use the internet to do this, but there is no reason not to.\nThe last reason your life sucks is because you don\u2019t contribute to humanity.\nYou don\u2019t contribute to humanity because you don\u2019t have something so valuable that you can\u2019t help but share it.\nYou don\u2019t have something valuable to offer because you are ignoring the problems in your life that beg a solution to be created.\nYou are ignoring the problems in your life because you don\u2019t have clarity on how to achieve the goal that will solve them.\nYou don\u2019t have clarity on how to achieve a goal because you have nothing to build. Nothing to frame and guide your learning.\nA value creator is someone who has intention behind their inputs and outputs.\nThey treat their life like a science project.\nThey identify their own problems.\nThey educate themselves with the infinite resources available to them on the internet.\nThey test the solution on themselves and distribute their experiences with writing.\nThey package up the most helpful and streamlined solutions in the form of a product or service.\nThat is how they make a living by living with purpose.\nBecoming a creator is the cure for overconsumption.\nI\u2019ve discussed this numerous times in my previous letters. I also break it all down in my book, The Art Of Focus.\nWriting is the vessel for distributing value.\nI write on all platforms. I don\u2019t care to compete with images of my fancy car or lifestyle. I gain a deep sense of fulfillment by using the internet as not only a place to curate good thoughts, but to organize them and share them with others with the ultimate upside of doing what I enjoy for a living. Something that\u2019s in my control.\nThis isn\u2019t about becoming famous.\nThis isn\u2019t about building a massive following.\nThis is about distributing the value you have to offer in a place that can reach anyone with the opportunities that will change your life and career.\nYou don\u2019t need a step-by-step course to join the online party.\nWrite what you want to write.\nTalk to who you want to talk to.\nGet your name in front of people by not being a ghost.\nGet eyes on your writing so it can spread more and more with time.\nIf you really need an extra push, just observe the people you are following for long enough.\nObserve what they write about.\nObserve how they write it.\nObserve who they interact with.\nObserve what they sell to make a living.\nPiece the dots together and begin emulating them.\nIf you don\u2019t have an answer, look it up.\nYou won\u2019t get all of your answers in an instant.\nBe okay with that.\nIf you know you are meant for more, start acting like it.\nYou don\u2019t have to write, but I\u2019ve tried it all.\nWith writing being the fundamental mode of communication that has survived throughout human existence, it\u2019s a great starting point to discover what you truly want to do.\nEnjoy the rest of your week my friends.\nDan Koe"

        "content": "I\u2019m going to be honest.\nMyself and Justin Scott are having a newsletter writing competition.\nWe set out to write 7 newsletters in 7 days to have a backlog.\nI even took it a step further and have been recording 7 YouTube videos day by day.\nToday\u2019s writing fell on a busy day, I was preparing Sprint curriculum calls.\nSo\u2026 I copy pasted this directly from Digital Economics (it\u2019s less than 1% of what\u2019s in there).\nIn my eyes, it is one of the most important skills you can master: persuasive communication.\nThat way, people actually share your writing (meaning you actually grow on social media).\nAs a bonus, I\u2019ve included a download link to a PDF (no email required) with what we discuss in this letter.\nOpen this PDF in another tab so you don\u2019t lose it.\nI would highly encourage you have it open while writing content.\nIt includes the 10 Koemmandments of Engagement and 32 post structures you can emulate \u2013 my personal swipe file.\nLet\u2019s dive in:\nPeople don\u2019t remember what you say, they remember how you make them feel.\nThis is worth repeating:\nHumans are emotional beings, not logical.\n99% of the population have not developed themselves to the point of being free from \u2014 or in control of \u2014 their ego.\nThat is the foundation of capturing and holding attention.\nPoking your reader\u2019s ego.\nFeeding it = making them feel \u201cgood.\u201d\nStarving it = making them feel \u201cbad.\u201d\nIf you can take people on an emotional journey of love, hate, excitement, deceit, calmness, and any other emotion that eventually ends in a benefit for their life \u2014 you have mastered the art of content creation.\nLife is story.\nSong is story (Uni-verse, one song).\nArchitecture, music, plant life, and everything else follow the Universal principles of highs/lows creation/destruction growth/death etc.\nHumans make sense of the world in stories.\nYour job is to use the power of word to make people feel something.\nStories mimic the natural highs and lows of emotion.\nBefore we start:\nThe Art Of Focus (my book) is available for pre-order.\n(This isn\u2019t a normal book launch, it is expensive, and for good reason.)\nThe paperback will release after the 2000 available copies of the Keepsake Edition sell out.\nDan\u2019s 10 Koemmandments Of Capturing Attention\nAs you are scrolling through social media or just reading content in general \u2014 try to keep an eye out for these tactics being used. That is the best way to solidify this information in your head. Notice when your attention is being captured and question \u201cwhy.\u201d\nThere are many ways to capture attention. I\u2019ve found these to be the most replicable and practical (number 8 is the most important):\n1) Specific Numbers\nUsing numbers in your hooks, headlines, or tweets will make people stop to see what the numbers relate to.\nThese can be in the form of:\nStatistics \u2014 \u201cThere are 7 billion people on this earth\u201d\nDollar amounts \u2014 \u201cApples new $1175 iPhone has this new feature\u201d\nMetrics \u2014 \u201cI sent 322 cold emails\u201d or \u201cAfter 293 days\u2026\u201d\nLists \u2014 \u201c7 bad habits that are preventing you\u2026\u201d\nThe more specific the number is, the more it catches people\u2019s attention.\nIf you can\u2019t make it super specific, that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t stress it.\nHere\u2019s an example from me that was the deciding factor in many people joining Digital Economics (my course):\n2) Pattern Interrupts\nA pattern interrupt is something that breaks people out of their normal conditioned patterns.\nIf someone is scrolling on X and is used to a lot of political commentary, a well-formatted list tweet will make them stop their scroll.\nMost of the things in this list are pattern interrupts.\n3) Negativity Bias\nThe human brain is wired to remember and pay attention to negativity.\nThis does not mean you have to be negative all the time.\nIt means you need to use the negative forms of words.\nIf you are saying something positive, but the point is better illustrated in its negative form, use that.\n\u201cYou are going to achieve great things.\u201d\nCompared to:\n\u201cYou will never hit rock bottom again.\u201d\nThe second is most potent. We remember negativity. It is the most relatable aspect of many people\u2019s lives.\nIt can still be a positive message while leveraging the reader\u2019s negativity bias.\n4) Group Callout\nThis is simple, call out the specific person you are talking to.\nIf you are in your 20\u2019s\u2026\nCalling all creators, coaches, and freelancers!\nFathers are a gift to humankind\u2026\nEven if your audience doesn\u2019t fall into the specific group you are calling out, it will allow them to \u201cpick a side\u201d and compare themselves to what you are saying.\nI talked about bodybuilders the other day. Even if people don\u2019t consider themselves one, it helps paint a picture that they can relate to:\nIf someone talks about being a father, I can still relate because I will be a father one day. I will still pay attention to and take the advice.\nThis also works when it comes time to promote. You can call out exactly who the promotion is for and paint a picture of the problems they are struggling with.\n5) Problem Callout\nCalling out the pains or problems people are experiencing will also make them relate to the post.\nMOST people have encountered the same problem or pain as everyone else throughout their life.\nIf you can describe the feeling accurately, you have attention at your fingertips.\nYou don\u2019t have to be dead on with this. Simply describing pain points will have people trying to relate their experiences to it. If they can relate, they will engage.\nHere\u2019s an example of calling out a pain as simple as \u201cfeeling terrible:\u201d\n6) Potential Benefit\nThe opposite of calling out a problem. Again, pains and benefits. Your mind needs to think in pains and benefits. That is your unique \u201cwhy\u201d behind whatever \u201cwhat\u201d or \u201chow\u201d you are writing about.\n7) Social Proof\nAgain this is authoritative and implies an information gap.\nWhen you flex your results or credentials, people automatically assume that you know more than them. They will take your content more seriously and read to find the information they are \u201cmissing.\u201d\nThis works 100x better when it isn\u2019t viewed as a \u201cflex.\u201d\nJustin Welsh is the current king of this:\nUse social proof to illustrate a point you are trying to make.\n8) Confidence & Conviction\nThis is by far the most important point here.\nYou can create highly impactful posts with confidence alone \u2014 it allows other aspects of attention-grabbing to fall into place.\nYou are right about everything at this very point in time in relation to your goals, vision, beliefs, values, and everything else that forms your perspective of reality.\nYour job is to have confidence and conviction in your beliefs and a credible or clear argument to back them up (if you have to).\nEveryone is on social media to be told what to do in a confident way. Nobody is secure in their actions, choices, and beliefs. They are looking for someone to confirm them with confidence and give them that clarity to act.\nTools you can use to sound more confident:\nEliminate words that imply uncertainty\nSpeak in absolutes when possible\nExaggerate your point to add energy\nOf course, do not abuse these for the sake of engagement.\nRather than saying:\n\u201cIt may be wise if some people developed their skillset.\u201d\nSay:\n\u201cIt is crucial that everyone on planet earth develops their skill set.\u201d\nJust by being confident, the words flow easier and the writing is more impactful.\nI can go on to back that argument up with statistics or more creative firepower that I have in my mind.\nHere is an example of me being confident in what I was saying:\nThis tweet got featured in a big newsletter and sparked a lot of controversy.\nPeople were arguing whether or not it was the \u201cgreatest\u201d skill. Some were proposing what their greatest skill was.\nThis made people comment and quote tweet, leading to more engagement and impressions.\nI wrote this tweet in the moment when I had executed on an idea quickly. Doing that gave me a lot of joy, so I wanted to share that joy with others. It worked.\nIs it 100% correct? No.\nWas it 100% correct when I wrote it, through my perspective, relating to my personal experience?\nYes. At the time I was 100% convinced that that was the greatest skill.\nI went on to add nuance in the replies. If I had added nuance in the actual tweet, it wouldn\u2019t have done as well and opened up the opportunity to be featured in a big newsletter.\nThe people YOU want to attract aren\u2019t the people that \u201chate\u201d on your work.\nHere is one other \u2014 a bit more extreme \u2014 example. Can you sense the motivational and practical energy \u201cflowing through the screen?\u201d\nBy the way, these types of high-energy advice posts pull in quite a bit of followers.\nIn summary \u2014 have some conviction behind what you are saying. This is not a skill that needs to be trained. It\u2019s just a matter of writing the words in the most impactful way. Leaders don\u2019t dance around the point they are trying to get across.\n9) Active Voice\nActive voice implies that there is a story. It eases people into what you are saying.\nPassive voice is often boring and gives away the \u201cmini-story\u201d too early. There is no anticipation that makes people want to figure out what happened next.\nWhen you are practicing writing posts, look up an article on active voice and use it to edit until you get the hang of it.\nThis also helps with being perceived as confident.\n10) Warnings & Cautionary Advice\nWhat should people look out for when they are trying to achieve something?\nCan you warn them of something they will encounter as they are trying to reach where you are now?\nWhen you are doing your weekly reflection, or just reflecting on your life, what roadblocks can you help people navigate?\nThis is best illustrated with this tweet. I hit on a hot topic like dopamine and warned them of another hot topic (then wrapped it up with confidence).\nThis sparked a LOT of controversy, but I have research to back up that point AND gave nuance in the replies to build a deeper connection with my audience:\nWhat Holds Attention?\nOnce the curiosity loop is opened, the mind feels committed to figuring out the rest of the story.\nThat is what holds attention \u2014 crafting a compelling story.\nStories are layers of metaphors, concepts, perspectives, and experiences that take people on a journey.\nPeople want to understand the entire story. They want to know what came before, during, and after any given event (from capturing attention).\nHere are 2 things to keep in mind when it comes to holding attention:\n1) Structure\nWe aren\u2019t in high school anymore. Long, professional paragraphs don\u2019t matter and reduce readability. Especially on X \u2014 people log on to that platform to escape the professional world.\nHow do you improve the structure of all of your content?\nBullet lists \u2014 use numbers, bullets, and other tactics that help you break apart what you are saying. These lists create a \u201cstory\u201d in themselves.\nLine breaks \u2014 use line breaks whenever possible, but don\u2019t just add line breaks for the sake of it. Be creative. Use line breaks to emphasize specific sentences and help your writing flow.\nStarting short and concise \u2014 Use shorter sentences or paragraphs at the start of your content. Capture attention with short and punchy statements, then let loose and get creative with how your sentences flow.\nBreak apart sentences \u2014 use parenthesis and \u201c\u2014\u201d dashes over commas. This sentence is too long (until I make people want to know what are in these parenthesis).\nHere is an example of all of the above in one hook:\n2) Novel Perspectives\nThis requires you to get the bulk of your ideas from books, podcasts, or other longer-form content that gives more nuance to certain ideas.\nNovelty increases dopamine levels in the brain. It brings more clarity to an idea that has been talked about over and over.\nIf you are getting all of your content from Twitter while trying to grow on Twitter \u2014 you will probably end up with the same perspective as everyone else.\nMetaphors, personal experiences, and creating new concepts is how you achieve this.\nThis will be our prime focus in future modules, so hold tight on this for now (but keep it in mind so you can start making connections as you consume).\nI was reading an article, learned about how a glass of water can create an acre of fog, and applied it to one of my sub-topics \u2014 mindfulness.\nContent consumption (or research) is important. Specifically books, audiobooks, podcasts, or articles. Those will give you different perspectives on the things you love talking about.\nWhat Creates Engagement?\nRemember: People don\u2019t remember what you say, they remember how you make them feel.\nAlan Watts may have been an alcoholic in his later years and cheated on his wives \u2014 which I have my own opinions about \u2014 but his work has changed my life for good. It gives me inspiration, clarity, and a new outlook on life.\nI may remember some quotes of his, but the reason I remember them is because of the clarity they gave me. The feeling of having zero worries in the world. When I want to experience that again, I throw on an Alan Watts lecture.\nYOU are but a humble messenger of a life-changing message.\n1) The feelings that come from education.\nLearning something new or gaining clarity on some aspect of their life raises dopamine levels in the brain.\nYou create clarity through novel perspectives, metaphors, stories, personal experiences, and other parts of your life that will help others understand what you are saying.\nYour job is to \u201cmake sense\u201d to a specific group of people.\nYou do this by sharing how certain topics make sense to you.\n2) The feelings that come from inspiration.\nInspiration is different from motivation.\nYou are helping people connect the dots on their own, giving them the clarity to make their own decisions and change their behavior.\nPeople feel good when they think they came up with the answer themselves \u2014 but will still attribute that feeling to you.\n3) The feeling that comes from entertainment.\nCan you throw in a joke, meme, or interesting point of view?\nWhen you watch a movie, you are entertained through humor, drama, emotional parts of the story, and battles that spark excitement in you.\nEntertainment, education, and inspiration are the main goals of your content.\nI hope you enjoyed this one.\nIf you want to become a digital writer who controls the outcome of their life through the internet, check out read more in the Digital Writer series.\nDan Koe\nP.S.

        "content": "I have a lot of followers.\n(Nothing like a bit of narcissism to get this started, right?)\nOn a serious note, I say that to frame this conversation. This is for people that want to grow on social media.\nI didn\u2019t always have this big of a readership.\nThis is obvious, but you know how human nature works.\nPeople create an image from what they know about you and base their judgments around that.\nPeople see I have 2.8 million followers and don\u2019t think I had 500 at one point with a cringeworthy profile.\nIt is extremely rare to find a human being who has done the self-development required to never judge a book by its cover.\nMy first attempt at social media was as a photographer.\nI was in love with taking photos but was never able to monetize it outside of a few $50 graduation shoots (the images sucked, sorry whoever paid me to do that).\nI would post my images on Instagram, use a bunch of hashtags that I copied from other accounts, and hope that I would somehow gain 100,000 followers someday. I had no monetization plan.\nEditing started to catch my eye more in more.\nI would start taking photos just to do some crazy edits on them.\nI spent my days binge-watching YouTube videos to learn Photoshop and Lightroom.\nEventually, I came across a guy named Visuals Of Julius.\nHe would post these surreal images. Something like I\u2019ve never seen before.\nI wanted to do what he did.\nSo, my YouTube binges continued.\nI borrowed some Adderall from my roommates and would lock myself in my room, jamming to heavy rock, creating whatever my heart desired.\nHere\u2019s one of my favorites:\nThis is when things started to get real.\nI started to uncover the \u201csecret\u201d to social media growth.\nMy beautiful images meant nothing on their own. I couldn\u2019t just post and hope that our lord and savior, The Algorithm, would save me.\nI had to get my content in front of people.\nI had to get my content shared by people with larger audiences than me.\n(When you zoom out, this is the one and only principle for social media growth, even if you are hosting X Spaces or a podcast where someone else is hosting you to share your spoken content).\nIn the digital art world, there are a lot of curation accounts.\nThese were accounts that posted their favorite digital art every day and tagged the creator.\nYou would only have a chance at getting seen by these accounts if you tagged them, used their hashtag, engaged with them, and possibly messaged them to build rapport.\nI was consistent for two months.\nI knew I had to create good content that the other accounts would want to share.\nIf I remember correctly, my posts got shared 30-40 times across accounts of varying sizes.\nAccounts like \u201cA Game Of Tones\u201d were the jackpot. If you could get shared by them you would skyrocket in followers. The dopamine hit from getting shared by 100K to 500K follower accounts was insane.\nIn my first 2 months, I grew my Instagram from 0 to 2500 followers.\nThe first 10,000 are always the hardest from what I\u2019ve experienced in myself and my students.\nAt this point, I burnt out and quit.\nI didn\u2019t see myself sustaining a stimulant addiction and 8-hour days to produce one Photoshop composite.\nAnd, I didn\u2019t know marketing or sales.\nI could have cashed out big if I would\u2019ve created an education product around how I create the art (take notes, artists, there\u2019s a reason every other big artist has a course or tutorial database. Sell what\u2019s selling).\nThis short-lived failure of growing a social media brand taught me what is actually necessary to grow:\nGet good content in front of other people \u2013 that\u2019s the only chance you have at someone following you.\nBut there are many ways to do this right.\nLet\u2019s talk about every growth mechanism you can leverage, ordered by priority.\nBefore we start, The Art Of Focus Keepsake Box is available for preorder:\nThe Keepsake Hardcover \u2013 we are only printing 2000 copies.\nThe digital download of the book so you can be the first to read.\nThe audiobook version when it is recorded and uploaded.\nThe FOCI Planner to deconstruct your ideal future into priority tasks.\nThe FOCI Coin to remember to act with intention.\nThe Digital Transformation Center with 12 hours of modern entrepreneurship trainings.\nThe Private Community for updates, discussion, and networking.\nA private invitation to an in-person event in Phoenix, AZ next year.\nThe price increases twice leading up to the release date.\nGet your 1 of 2000 copies here.\nBig Picture \u2013 How To Grow On Social Media\nI no longer do Photoshop art.\nI\u2019m a writer now, and this is a part of the Digital Writer series, so we will be talking about this from that lens \u2013 how to get your writing shared. (If you want a primer on what and how to write, read this letter on writing authentic content).\nBy writing, I mean anything written on social media, which is almost everything.\nCaptions, Instagram posts with text on the image, tweets, LinkedIn posts, reels scripts, YouTube scripts, etc.\nSocial media growth is so straightforward that everyone overcomplicates it, or they don\u2019t pay attention to it at all.\nSome people post and post and post just to get mad at the algorithm for not spreading their content.\nOther people know how to grow, and they are intelligent individuals, but their posts are like art pieces that never get purchased. The artist thinks they are the best thing in the world, but the market couldn\u2019t care less.\nThen, there are those who grow a bit but don\u2019t know how to double down on their best ideas to compound that growth.\n1) Write Persuasive Content\nThe keyword here is persuasive.\nPersuasion implies a few things:\nA hook. Be mindful as to whether or not your first sentence will grab their attention. This goes beyond just the words you use. The structure and design of the post can do this, even on X.\nA big problem. Imply or state a problem that people can relate to. Don\u2019t make it too high level.\nA clear solution. An actionable way to overcome the problem, preferably with a unique way of doing so from personal experience.\nA big benefit. Imply or state a desirable benefit that people will receive from your advice.\nConfidence or polarization. Stand firm in your beliefs but be willing to change them. Nobody wants to follow someone who doesn\u2019t sound confident or can\u2019t choose a side. Say what you want to say. You will get hate like everyone else.\nA novel perspective OR big idea. This is why reading or consuming content is important. If you can find a way of explaining an idea that isn\u2019t normal, it will give your readers a dopamine hit and advance their understanding.\nThe best way to solidify these in your head is to save them somewhere safe and try to spot them in the content you see online.\nI will be going over 10 strategies to make your writing more engaging in the next letter (with examples).\nI teach all of this (how to write and grow a brand around your interests) in 2 Hour Writer.\n2) Get Eyes On Your Content\nWe\u2019ve discussed this and will discuss it in depth in the next section.\nFor now, nail into your head that your content is meaningless if you don\u2019t get eyes on it. This should be obvious.\nIt\u2019s fine to write content into the void for practice, but don\u2019t let that turn into an excuse because you are afraid to grow and face criticism.\n3) Iterate On Your Ideas With Data\nYou can only reach this step if you have eyes on your content.\nYou don\u2019t know what ideas work best for you if you don\u2019t have any engagement on them.\nWhen you do, review your highest-performing content in your analytics each month. Copy and paste them into a notes document.\nWhen you go to write more content, sprinkle in those ideas and write about them from different angles.\nThis is how you increase your engagement with time.\n4) Create Depth & Span For Your Best Ideas\nYou can do well on one platform like X, but you will eventually become a slave to that platform.\nYou will have to continue using growth strategies to keep your content in front of people. It won\u2019t live on very long.\nModern power belongs to those who hold the most attention in their lifetime.\nA short post that holds 10 seconds of attention is nothing compared to a video, podcast, or newsletter that holds 15-60 minutes of attention.\nYou must take your best ideas (from the last part) and turn them into longer-form content.\nThis is how you get your name spread without you trying.\nThis is how you build the roots of your brand deep into the collective psyche.\nThis is how you build trust and authority orders of magnitude higher than those who only post short content.\nThis is why you will almost always attribute the results in your life to a book or an author who taught you how.\nEven if someone talks about the same ideas on social media, the author will pop into your head (holding your attention) when you read it.\nTraffic Mechanisms \u2013 How To Get Your Writing Shared\nNow that you are hopefully writing and posting content, it helps to understand the mechanics of the social media game.\nWhen you understand how these allow you to grow, you can get creative with how you get your content shared.\nThese are in no specific order.\nTest them all and see what works best.\nDon\u2019t fall for the trap of social media gurus telling you one is any better than the other because tHe ALgoRiThM cHanGEd!!!\n1) Replies\nThis is the most obvious one that everyone does.\nIf you reply to somebody else\u2019s posts, and readers go into the comments, they have a chance of seeing your reply.\nIf your reply is good, they may click to your profile, read your content, and follow you if it\u2019s good.\nThere are a few things here that people miss:\nBoring content doesn\u2019t make people read the replies. I see people reply to boring posts all day and get a few impressions on their replies. Then they wonder what went wrong because.\nBoring replies don\u2019t make people click on your profile. Stop repeating what was said in the first post. Talk about yourself here. Tell people how you\u2019ve experienced the same thing in your life. Talking about yourself leads to the most profile clicks.\nSmall accounts get fewer impressions overall. It\u2019s good to reply and network with accounts at your size, but don\u2019t think it will help you grow by much (that\u2019s fine, you should still do it). Just be sure you are replying to bigger accounts with interesting content.\n2) Quote Posts\nQuote posts are when someone reposts your content with their own commentary. This can be on X or if someone shares your post to their IG story with their own commentary.\nOn X, this can work very well if you know how to write persuasive content.\nIf you quote post someone with valuable advice or something interesting, the original creator may repost you to their audience. This means you get more eyes on your content, which increases the potential for people to click on your profile and follow you.\nBe wary here, don\u2019t aim too high with this one like you would with replies.\nBigger creators have so many notifications that they will probably miss your post.\nBe able to view your growth efforts from the lens of the creator\u2019s audience you are trying to leverage.\n3) Reposts\nYour content has to be good enough, and relatable enough, for people to want to share on their feeds.\nAlways think this through before hitting post.\nWill people share it? Why should they share it? Do they identify with anything I am saying? Is it polarizing enough to spark discussion and get comments?\n4) Manual DMs\nThis one is more difficult and slow, but it works for networking and getting big accounts to share your posts (if you\u2019re a normal person who isn\u2019t a LinkedIn corporate robot in their messages).\nNobody wants to receive a message like, \u201cHey! Great to connect! I love your stuff! We should have a virtual coffee and talk about the complexities of zapier automations to enhance the overall experience of your loyal email subscribers so that you can build an incredible digital presence!!!!\u201d\nYou can make friends online to the point where they are happy to just share whatever you send them.\nHere\u2019s a letter I wrote on my Non-Needy Networking Process. Use it wisely and don\u2019t copy anything I say.\nThe manual DM method can also cross over into a method for controlling your growth.\nSending 1 DM may get 1 impression on your posts, but the potential that they share those posts is higher if you have a genuine conversation.\nHow To Control Your Growth On Any Platform\nIf you are smart, you can use any of the traffic mechanisms we discussed in creative ways to control your growth.\nThose are the only tools you can use to grow if you don\u2019t want to be a slave to the algorithm.\n1) Short Form To Long Form\nShort-form platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok are inherently more easy to grow on than something like YouTube or a podcast.\nYou can write more content that gets shared with the traffic mechanisms we discussed.\nI couldn\u2019t grow on YouTube for the life of me, but I knew how to control my growth on X.\nSo I posted to both and funneled my audience to YouTube with time.\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything that I\u2019m saying here, but this route makes sense considering everyone wants to be a YouTuber.\nYou\u2019re probably going to have to take a smarter path, and this is one of them.\n2) Curation, Quotes, & Remixing\nDJs and producers grow by remixing popular songs so they can \u201csteal\u201d the traffic from that popular song.\nSometimes they will post reels on Instagram with their remix and the original artist (usually with a lot of followers and clout) would share it to their page or story.\nThis was a similar case to when I was doing digital art.\nI could remix someone else\u2019s art, tag them, and possibly get shared.\nThe same is true for writers.\nYou can:\nQuote them in a thread or newsletter. Use their ideas in your longer posts to illustrate a point. Then DM them the post saying that you mentioned them. They may repost it without you asking.\nCommentate on their content. Similar to how YouTubers make reaction videos to leverage the traffic that the larger creator is getting.\nGet people on a podcast. People love getting on podcasts. This is how you can get exposed to a larger creator\u2019s audience. They will share the podcast to have their audience watch or listen.\nTalk about their ideas and credit them. A simple post where you say \u201cThe best idea I\u2019ve seen this week:\u201d then go on to explain how it impacted you and credit the original author.\nThis stresses the importance of long-form paired with short-form. It will be difficult to pull this off in a short post.\nYou can, of course, write longer posts on platforms like X to leverage this strategy.\n3) Paid Growth\nThis one gets touchy.\nPeople who are \u201csuper authentic\u201d and moral and noble (who also have zero experience with social media) love to say how authentic and moral they are for not using paid growth strategies.\nI\u2019ve observed these people over the years, and 4 years down the road they\u2019ve either not grown at all or have lost followers.\nPeople don\u2019t like bitter complainers who stop focusing on providing value and pushing a more holistic worldview.\nNow, I\u2019m not talking about running ads to gain followers. That\u2019s the worst thing you could do. Do not do it. I repeat, do not do it.\nI\u2019m also not talking about paying for Instagram shoutouts where you pay a large theme account to post your content and shout at people to follow you.\nThose are the accounts that have 500K followers with zero engagement.\nI\u2019m talking about a truly authentic post and using a little money to boost your results.\nGood content is a prerequisite.\nThe paid growth I\u2019m talking about is paying larger accounts that you resonate with to spend their time on one of the traffic mechanisms from above.\nLarge accounts are busy and probably won\u2019t do this unless you pay them to pay attention to you. This isn\u2019t unfair. It\u2019s just reality. You don\u2019t understand what they are building that occupies their attention.\nYou can ask them to repost you.\nOn X, this is as simple as having them share your post.\nOn Instagram, this is having them share your post to their story.\nDo not have them say anything or tag you.\nLet the readers see your content and follow you if they want to.\nYou can ask them to reply to you.\nThis works well on something like X when the platform starts to favor comments.\nThis is often easier on the creator you are paying because they aren\u2019t sharing something to their feed.\nYou can really ask them to do anything.\nDM them, ask if they offer help to grow, take the conversation elsewhere, and negotiate a deal.\nIn my eyes, this is a far better approach than paid ads or anything else to monetize your products or services.\nBuild your audience with authentic shares, let people follow you because they like your content, and then promote your offer to your audience as it grows.\nIf you think it\u2019s fine for advertisers to promote a product randomly in your face, then I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fine for creators to accept money to share content (that you\u2019ll probably like) without asking you to buy anything.\n4) Masterminds\nHarsh truth:\nEvery creator you know is in a group chat with other creators.\nThey talk strategy and have fun building businesses together.\nThey also share each other\u2019s posts and help them grow.\nThey use the traffic mechanisms to create a strategy they can bake into their routine.\nSome groups comment on each other\u2019s posts each morning.\nOthers repost the posts that they share in the group.\nMost of all, they form a tribe and start to identify as a part of a group.\nYou can notice that there are tribes of 5-10 creators that all talk to each other online. This is why.\nYes, you will have to DM people, make friends, and let these relationships form almost naturally.\nThis is a long-term game.\nYou will not see insane results in less than a year by staying consistent with all of this.\nEven then, you can still use other strategies to monetize as you grow.\nThat\u2019s it for this one.\nThank you for reading.\nDan Koe\nP.S.

        "content": "This is the start of the Digital Writer series.\nOver the coming weeks (with some breaks for a few harsh truths and self-improvement letters) we will dive deep into how to become a profitable writer while talking about your interests.\nLet\u2019s begin.\nI\u2019ve always been a creative at heart.\nI loved the thought of working from my laptop, living anywhere in the world, and not having to worry about money.\nNaturally, I studied things like graphic design, photography, and film.\nThose were valuable skills to learn, but they never really got me anywhere.\nI knew that I had to learn something that was valued by the market more, but I didn\u2019t want to give up my creative edge.\nThat\u2019s when I took a web development class in college.\nI became obsessed.\nThe promises of a high-paying job without a degree and the infinite resources I could use to teach myself to code were enticing.\nAnd I didn\u2019t have to let go of my creativity if I did front-end design.\nCreativity paired with coding seemed more valuable than something like graphic design alone, but only to the job market (from my level of awareness at the time).\nI have always wanted to do my own thing.\nGetting a job was the bane of my existence.\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to observe society and see that most people were overweight and unhappy. The common theme was that they all had their precious resource, time, sucked away from them by a job that worked them to death.\nLong story short, I never was able to monetize my creativity.\nIt\u2019s not because I wasn\u2019t skilled enough, it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t stack other skills that would allow me to make money. I wasn\u2019t skilled in the right things that would allow me to monetize my main skill. Another loss for \u201cfocus on one thing.\u201d\nI\u2019ll talk about my full story in one of the next letters, but for now, just know that it didn\u2019t work out.\nI had to swallow my pride and get a job.\nLuckily, I was able to land the first web design job I applied for because I took a year to teach myself to code (and had design experience before that).\nLesson:\nYou don\u2019t need to go to school to get a high-paying job.\nThat job can be used as a launchpad for building your own thing.\nBefore we start, The Art Of Focus Keepsake Box is available for preorder:\nThe Keepsake Hardcover \u2013 we are only printing 2000 copies.\nThe digital download of the book so you can be the first to read.\nThe audiobook version when it is recorded and uploaded.\nThe FOCI Planner to deconstruct your ideal future into priority tasks.\nThe FOCI Coin to remember to act with intention.\nThe Digital Transformation Center with 12 hours of modern entrepreneurship trainings.\nThe Private Community for updates, discussion, and networking.\nA private invitation to an in-person event in Phoenix, AZ next year.\nThe price increases twice leading up to the release date.\nHow I Made Millions As A Digital Writer\nI worked at a web design agency for a year.\nThis was a blessing, because it showed me the exact pieces I was missing in my freelance web design business.\nThe agency had a marketing, sales, and operations department.\nMarketing and sales generated and closed leads.\nOperations handed them off to the designers (me).\nI built their website and handed it off to them.\nIt made sense, so I started studying skills like copywriting, sales, direct response marketing, and all of the other skills that people tell you to learn.\nIn my free time, I would try everything under the sun to land clients.\nCold email.\nCold calls.\nCold DMs.\nFacebook Group networking.\nPaid Facebook and Google ads.\nWalking into local businesses and talking to the manager.\nWriting down the phone numbers of services businesses from their vehicle graphics (like pest control).\nI started landing a few clients, but not nearly enough as I wanted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I replaced my income and quit my job within my year at the web design agency.\nBut I didn\u2019t just want to replace my income.\nI wanted to make millions\u2026 because who doesn\u2019t?\nI was well off, making close to $100,000 a year \u2013 mostly from referrals after a lot of manual effort \u2013 and was able to quit my job.\nA few things happened at this point.\nAnd they could only happen at this point, because my mind wouldn\u2019t understand them without my prior experience and failures.\n1) I began to understand the power of social media.\nWhy in the world was I doing all of this manual work to land clients?\nWhy didn\u2019t I realize that people posting content and building a following had unlimited clients at their fingertips (if they understood marketing and sales)?\nIf I could build an audience, that would save me 10-20 hours a week generating leads for my freelance services.\nAnd if I built a large enough following, I could pivot out of client work. That would save me even more time because I could monetize digital or physical products.\nYou can start to see where my 4-Hour Workday philosophy comes from.\n2) I had the experience to grow on X.\nCenturies ago, there was a social media app called Twitter.\nI never really cared for it.\nBut for some reason, I started using it more and more.\nI noticed people talking about everything I liked.\nSelf-improvement, mindset, philosophy, web design, business, marketing, and more. Often from the same accounts. They didn\u2019t seem to limit the topics they talked about, because it was obvious that they all overlapped (similar to how this newsletter can be categorized as any one of those topics). They told you to \u201cchoose a niche\u201d but didn\u2019t have one themselves. Their products and services were niched down, not their personal brand.\nIf they were generating traffic with their content and had the successful business they said they did\u2026 why couldn\u2019t I do the same?\nI started emulating their content structure and posting the ideas in my head.\nRemember, I had prior copywriting and direct response marketing knowledge.\nI knew what was necessary to write a post that captured attention and generated enough interest to follow me.\nIn my first year, I gained around 10,000 followers.\nIn my second year, that jumped to 50,000.\nIn my third year, another jump to 100,000.\nThen, I used my validated ideas to post to other platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. I knew they would get engagement because I had so much data from writing on Twitter.\nToday, 4 years later, I have around 2,800,000 followers across all platforms.\nTalk about exponential growth and how consistency is king.\nThere is a lot more to this social media growth thing. I\u2019ll talk about that in a letter soon called How To Actually Grow On Social Media (What They Don\u2019t Tell You). For now you can read this letter on networking.\n3) Everything pointed to writing.\nWriting on Twitter made me realize one thing.\nI wasn\u2019t just writing on Twitter.\nI was writing emails, newsletters, landing pages, promotions, video scripts, direct messages, course curriculums, product material\u2026 everything.\nIt wasn\u2019t too long until I just considered myself a writer.\nThat\u2019s all I did every single morning.\nThat was the driver of all growth in my business.\nMy ability to capture attention, create value, and impact my readers was all due to writing.\nThis is how 2 Hour Writer was birthed. That\u2019s a course where I teach my entire writing ecosystem. Because everything in business \u2013 no matter what you do \u2013 starts with writing.\nMost writers want to sell their writing, and they can with something like a paid blog, newsletter, or community, but that is limiting.\nWriting is both a traffic generation mechanism and the means to create an information product.\nWhen you know how to write, market, and sell, you can earn an income writing about whatever you want.\n4) My income grew with my readership.\nA few years ago I read a tweet that said you can make $0.50-$1 per follower per month (with your own product or service of course, not by relying on platform monetization or Adsense).\nThis held true for me up until a point.\nFrom years 1-3 I made about $1 per follower per month.\nSo, $10,000 then $50,000 then $100,000.\nI made $800,000 in my third year.\nThis past year I\u2019ve passed my follower count in income, around $3.1 million so far.\nThere are a lot of technical details here, but one thing holds true:\nIf you slowly build a decent readership, launch a new product, and get 80% of things right, I find it hard to believe that you couldn\u2019t make a million dollars.\nAt this point, if you stick it out, the path should be blatantly obvious to you.\nThe main trap I see is people playing short-term money games. Blasting their audience with promotions on a crappy product and never improving what they offer.\nThe Principles Of Monetizing Your Writing\nI don\u2019t want to give you hacks and tactics.\nThis is a long-term game.\nThe sooner you accept that the sooner you will get results, because the quickest fix is the longest path.\nInstead, I want to give you principles to focus on.\nThese will be the main drivers of monetizing your writing.\n1) Distribution \u2013 Choosing A Writing Platform\nDistribution is how you bridge product and people.\nFor writers, social media is how you are going to do that.\nYou don\u2019t need to start on a writing platform, but why wouldn\u2019t you?\nYou don\u2019t need to post pictures of your body.\nYou can prioritize learning and idea generation.\nYou don\u2019t need to design graphics or edit videos.\nIt is a peaceful existence unless you want to expand in the future.\nI recommend X as your starting point because you can control growth with strategies we will talk about later.\nMedium, blog sites, and newsletters take longer to grow.\nIn my eyes, it\u2019s easier to build an X following and transfer your audience to long-form writing down the road.\n2) Offer \u2013 How You Monetize An Audience\nBeginners tend to see YouTubers pulling in big numbers from ad revenue and think that\u2019s the best way to monetize.\nEven now with X monetization being a thing\u2026 I\u2019m seeing this more and more.\nThis is arguably the stupidest way to think.\nYou started doing this because you want more autonomy in your life.\nDon\u2019t be a slave to the algorithm.\nYou have to create a product or service.\nHere\u2019s what I would do:\nStart a freelance business. You won\u2019t have a large following at first. So you do more manual work to land writing clients for a higher price than something like a course. This allows you to make an income. (You can sell social media content, copywriting, emails, etc. Just don\u2019t offer plain old \u201cwriting.\u201d)\nWeen off of manual outreach. As your audience grows you can leverage that for landing clients. This frees up time to start creating a product.\nTurn your freelance service into a product. You can keep freelancing, but having a digital product, course, or physical product allows you to earn without manual labor.\nDo whatever you want. At this point, you should have the mental and financial resources to build and monetize whatever you want. Enjoy the freedom that a proper skill stack and experience provides.\nOne last thing, most people create a product and see zero results. I would recommend enrolling in Digital Economics for my monetization systems, or reading my previous letter on Value Creation.\n3) Leverage & Scalability\nIf you don\u2019t prioritize leverage and scalability, you won\u2019t be able to make $1 million a year (at least without hating your life).\nThe Internet allows businesses to scale without hiring an insane amount of employees.\nDigital tools, software, and automation allow you to do what used to take 10 employees by yourself.\nAs you are writing and building, you have to continue to evolve your products to take up less of your time.\nThe obvious and priority thing to do is turn your service (like freelancing) into a digital product (like a course teaching the same thing to a more beginner-level audience).\nIn my case, I was a freelance web designer.\nSo, to free up more time, I created 2 products in my first year.\nOne taught how to create websites and landing pages.\nThe other taught my manual methods for landing freelance clients.\nIn my second year, I stopped freelance web design as a whole.\nSome people get tied to what they do even if they see a better opportunity.\nI had so much more experience at this point. It didn\u2019t make sense to continue doing something less profitable and more time-consuming.\nSo, I transitioned into marketing consulting for online businesses.\nI had direct access to them on social media anyway. It just made sense.\nEventually, I did the same thing.\nI turned that marketing consulting into a more expensive course.\nThe lesson:\nYou and your business must continue to evolve.\nFor me, it happened every 6 months.\nI felt things getting slow and stagnant.\nI had to create new products and services to survive in the Wild West of entrepreneurship.\n4) Promotions \u2013 The Destroyer Of Brands\nI\u2019ve talked about my new book, The Art Of Focus, for close to 3 years now.\nI still have people message me saying they had no idea I wrote a book.\nJust because someone followed you or read one of your posts doesn\u2019t mean they know what they can buy from you \u2013 even if they\u2019re a perfect fit.\nYou. Have. To. Promote.\nPromoting means telling people about your product or service and sending them to a page where they can read more and buy.\nA simple framework for this is PAS.\nProblem \u2013 capture their attention by talking about the problem they are facing that your product solves. \u201cIf you struggle with\u2026\u201d is a great place to start.\nAmplify \u2013 talk about how the problem impacts their life and why it needs to be solved.\nSolution \u2013 Position your offer as the solution to the problem so they click and read more.\nYou can plug your products, services, or newsletter in the comments of your posts, in your story, or randomly in your writing like I did above.\nWhenever people come to me for help with monetization, they may have problems with their marketing, but most of the time it\u2019s just a lack of promotion.\nThey don\u2019t set a schedule to promote once a day in any of their content.\nThis is a surefire way to get trapped as a starving artist.\nSummary: How To Make $1 Million A Year As A Writer\nI wish I could tell you it\u2019s going to be easy, but it\u2019s not.\nThe principles are pretty straightforward.\nUse writing to build a readership (that grows infinitely with the internet if you know how to improve when you hit a stunt in growth).\nBuild a product that your readers want (and if it doesn\u2019t sell, that\u2019s not on them, it\u2019s on you. Create a better product and try again).\nStick it out for multiple years if not the rest of your life.\nEntrepreneurship means you\u2019re in full control of how much you make.\nYour income is only limited by your perspective, beliefs, skill set, and real-world practice.\nEnjoy the rest of your week.\nDan Koe\nIt makes sense to plug 2 Hour Writer here again, so I\u2019m plugging it."

This led to a massive shift in how I view online business.\nI moved back to Scottsdale, Arizona on a whim. We broke our lease, threw the 10 or so items we owned in my car, and stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks before our next lease started.\nI\u2019m in Phoenix now, but feel the itch to move again, so I\u2019m going to within the next two weeks. With the book and software launch coming up, I need to shock my system and hurl myself into the unknown.\nThat\u2019s where I thrive, but only if I have the skill to accept the challenge.\nUpdate: I started writing this on Friday, today is Monday, my move in date is tomorrow (Tuesday). Lease was broken Saturday \ud83d\ude42\nQuality of life, idea generation, and dopamine are through the roof right now.\nEverything is meaningful because I have so much responsibility that all information can be applied in a practical manner.\nIf life feels meaningless, it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t training your responsibility muscle.\nYou haven\u2019t lifted the emotional weight to add more to the bar and see progress on a deeper level than muscle.\nTactical Stress \u2013 The Secret Behind Abnormal Results\nGoldfish grow to fit the tank you put them in.\nBut if you keep them in a small bowl, they never grow.\nA similar phenomenon exists that is illustrated by Parkinson\u2019s Law:\n\u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u201d\nWhat I call \u201cTactical Stress\u201d is quite similar:\nTactical stress is the conscious decision to force yourself into a do or die situation \u2013 knowing that you have the skill to make it work \u2013 and have no choice but to overcome your fears. The result is a season of intensity that propels you into the next level of your life.\nWhen you have an understanding of this concept, you add it as a tool to your mental toolbelt.\nWhen you identify yourself as being stuck in a rut, you can use this as a tool to force you to dig yourself out.\nThere are a few applications and strategies you can use as inspiration:\nThe Philosophy & Psychology Of Tactical Stress\nEvery time I\u2019ve used tactical stress to break out of a rut, what\u2019s followed has always been a season of intense productivity.\nI wouldn\u2019t be doing anything else but working.\nThis is one of the few times that I break my 4 Hour Workday principle. I will work long hours and enjoy every second of it.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that these periods are also my most creative.\nUsually, productivity and creativity exist on polar ends of a spectrum.\nBut there is the theme of going full circle, where polar ends collapse into one, usually indicating a heightened degree of the flow state.\nGoing Full Circle\nImagine a straight line with black on one end, white on the other, and a gradient to blend them together in the middle.\nThis line can represent most things in life, because nothing is always black or white.\nEverything exists on a spectrum. Everything is relative. Everything is a state of mind or consciousness.\nThere are degrees of energy, productivity, creativity, intelligence, anger, sadness, happiness, calmness, stress, saltiness, sweetness, roughness, softness, brightness, and darkness.\nAll of these blend together to create your human experience.\nThey aren\u2019t limited to one but can be isolated with your awareness of them. You can pick apart your current state of mind and explore its depths.\nNow, imagine the black-to-white gradient line from before.\nBut now connect the two ends so that it forms a circle.\nThe black now flips immediately to white.\nThis is a more accurate representation of life, or your state of mind, than a flat line with two dead ends.\nThis flip and color represents the phenomenon of going full circle.\nWhen someone is so dumb they become smart.\nWhen someone is so unfunny they become funny.\nWhen someone is so tired they become energetic.\nWhere the black and white ends touch is where tactical stress comes into play. Where you consciously push certain aspects of reality to their limit and watch it bounce back in your favor.\nThe Psychology Of Tactical Stress\nThe purpose of tactical stress is to launch yourself into the unknown \u2013 the land of infinite potential.\nYou become overwhelmed with information.\nIt\u2019s too much for your mind to metabolize.\nSo, you\u2019re forced to create clarity from the chaos.\nYou set a goal that is borderline impossible, force yourself to achieve it, and transmute the stress to study and act your a** off until it becomes reality.\nDoing this does a few things.\nFirst, it creates a frame of reference.\nYour goal must stay top of mind when you launch into the unknown. Your goal is how you filter signal from noise. Your goal is how you spot opportunities in the chaotic mess of information flooding your mind.\nIf you forced yourself to move across the country and become a digital nomad, you will notice that certain information is more useful for actualizing that goal.\nYou will naturally notice certain social media posts, follow new accounts, and begin programming your mind to perform specific actions.\nSecond, it creates a deadline.\nEveryone knows that deadlines are powerful for increasing your productivity. But most deadlines aren\u2019t real.\nWhen you fly across the country or invest your life savings in coaching, the deadline is as real as it can get.\nYou either make it work or let yourself fall apart because your survival is at stake.\nTactical stress puts you in a temporary state of survival mode.\nIt\u2019s unhealthy, yes, but it\u2019s temporary.\nThird, it narrows your focus.\nWhen your mind is narrowed on your goal, distractions can\u2019t penetrate your frame.\nIt\u2019s all you can focus on.\nYou go to bed thinking about it.\nYour mind won\u2019t stop strategizing a plan to get you out of this situation.\nAnd once you gain clarity on what you must do, through study and action, you use that laser focus to build whatever is necessary to actualize the goal.\nRemoving Your Money Limits\nIt\u2019s safe to say that at a certain point, you will have to start a business if you want to keep pushing further in life.\nThe only reason I was able to do this time and time again was because I had a business.\nA business gives you the creative boundaries to increase your income as much as you\u2019d like. That isn\u2019t possible at any job. I don\u2019t care about the CEO who climbed the ranks over 40 years to make a huge salary when I can achieve that in 2-6 years of focused effort on building my own thing.\nTactical stress was my method for forcing my business to grow.\nWhen I moved across the country or invested my life\u2019s savings, it created a need for more money.\nIf I didn\u2019t have a business, I wouldn\u2019t be able to increase my income that rapidly. It would take years to job hop my way to $100,000 extra dollars.\nIn business, all that takes me is a proper strategy, the right skill set, a compelling offer, and enough traffic to sell $100,000 worth of it. Yes, I\u2019m aware that\u2019s an oversimplification, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong or not worth listening to.\nBuild your own thing.\nStrategies For Tactical Stress\nThroughout my life, here is what I\u2019ve done that I would consider tactical stress.\nThese are not the only ways to do it, but they could be used as inspiration.\nA lot of you have creator businesses (or are at least trying to build one) and one of these could be the push you need.\n1) Launching a product before building it.\nBeginners think you need a product or service before you can start selling it.\nThis is the stupidest way to go about it.\nYou don\u2019t even know if the idea is validated yet.\nInstead, create the offer and landing page.\nSet a launch date 3-4 weeks out. This is your deadline.\nStart promoting, hard.\nThis will obviously require you to have the knowledge and skills of how to build an audience and create a compelling product or service.\nI would recommend watching my One Person Business playlist on YouTube, or enroll in Digital Economics if you want all of my systems laid out for you.\nOnce you have one buyer, the pressure is on.\nYou either create the MVP (minimum viable product) in record time or you fail and refund all of the money you made.\n2) Location hopping.\nI didn\u2019t do this on purpose, but I\u2019ve found myself moving locations every 6 months over the past 2 years.\nMostly because I felt like I\u2019d exhausted everything from that location.\nI knew all of the restaurants. I knew all of the walking paths. I knew what additions I was able to make to my friend group.\nThere was no further room for discovery.\nSo, when things began getting monotonous, I moved.\nThis also holds true for building a business vs working a job.\nEntrepreneurship keeps you on your toes. If you become stagnant, that\u2019s your fault. You have the choice to scale as high as you want to go and personal development will be forced to follow.\nWhen I moved, I always made an effort to increase the quality of environment I was in.\nBetter network.\nBetter resources.\nBetter walkability.\nBetter access to food.\nOf course, this comes at a cost. That\u2019s where tactical stress comes in.\nI would sign a lease at an apartment that felt like it was at the edge of my comfort zone.\nSomething I could afford, but would have to increase my income to relieve the stress that came with a higher payment.\nSurvival is a potent short-term productivity tool.\n3) Investing in education.\nI was a course hoarder.\nI purchased at least 50 social media, web development, freelancing, and marketing courses throughout my journey.\nThey helped build my knowledge but weren\u2019t enough to kick me into action.\nAfter seeing some success with freelance web design, I knew I wanted to go all in on social media.\nI saw the potential in being able to infinitely build a readership over the course of my entire life.\nI saw that building an audience with valuable writing (that they wanted to read) would allow me to build and sell anything I wanted to make a living \u2013 as long as the customer wanted it as well.\nThis is the driving force behind why I created 2 Hour Writer. To pass along the power of the digital word.\nWhat did I do?\nI spent $3500 on a coaching program.\nThat did not feel good to my mental bank account.\nWhat happened?\nI showed up to one coaching call.\nOne.\nBut that was all I needed to show me that I already knew what I had to do.\nWrite content, get it shared by making high online social status friends, and iterate on products or services until I strike gold.\nThe investment in the program forced me to start doing what I do now and never quit.\n4) Material items.\nThis one is touchy.\nI\u2019m not a super materialistic guy.\nI\u2019m literally writing this in my living room that only has a desk in it. No couch, no TV, nothing. Just a desk to write at.\nBut, material items have their perks.\nOne is that they signal status.\nSure, you don\u2019t want to play status games, but everyone judges a book by it\u2019s cover.\nThat car or watch or shirt could be the unconscious deciding factor that makes someone want to give you a million-dollar opportunity.\nI drive a fairly nice car.\n(For those curious, it\u2019s a Mercedes GT63s \u2013 matte black of course to stay on brand).\nThe amount of business cards people give me as I\u2019m walking to it are insane. The attention is a bit annoying but you can\u2019t deny the bump in social status.\nJust don\u2019t let materialism consume you.\nI\u2019m ready to sell it or even just let it go at a moment\u2019s notice if the situation calls for it.\nWhen I bought the car cash, that was an enormous chunk out of my wallet.\nIt was almost automatic to build, sell, and launch a new offer to make that money back in a week with the leverage I\u2019ve built over time.\n5) Degeneracy.\nAnother touchy one.\nThere are obvious lines that you can cross with all of these.\nTactical stress is not for the mindless.\nI also don\u2019t like sugarcoating what I\u2019ve done that\u2019s helped my personal growth but is often demonized by the straight-edge Huberman cult.\nThe pre-requisite to all of this is having a goal that is so potent (because you\u2019ve invested enough energy in it already) that if you weren\u2019t to achieve it \u2013 it would feel like an early death.\nSo, when you decide to go out, party, and have one too many drinks\u2026 you will feel the lack of progress you are making the next day.\nYou will get mad at yourself.\nYou will be stressed that you are falling behind.\nThat brings us to our last point.\nEmotional Transmutation \u2013 Turning Stress Into Fuel\nThe only thing more painful than pursuing the highest version of yourself is not pursuing the highest version of yourself.\nAs you launch yourself into stressful situations, you will have to deal with the negative emotions that come with that state of mind.\nThese are the moments where you build the mental strength to overcome difficult situations.\nThe emotional burden will make or break you.\nIf you can lift the weight and get stronger, you will be surprised how easy life becomes. Minor inconveniences that ruin most people will not phase you.\nAnother thing, regret is a necessary part of life.\nYou can\u2019t avoid it.\nMost people dwell on their regrets as if they can change them.\nYou have two options: view them as ugly stains that make life worse, or view them as cracks that can be sealed with better future decisions.\nThere is one pattern I\u2019ve noticed in people looking to improve their life.\nThe pain of where you are must outweigh the pain of what other people think.\nPeople will think you are stupid for making \u201cstupid\u201d decisions.\nPeople will talk about you when you are making big changes.\nMost of the time, they just want to entertain themselves.\nThey don\u2019t understand the information behind your decisions.\nYou will learn to ignore them with time.\nWhat\u2019s the other option?\nLet your dreams die on the shelf because people say something you don\u2019t like?\nThat\u2019s a great way to end up like everyone else.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "One of the best compliments you can get is \u201cI like the way your mind works.\u201d\nAnd when I was young, I always envied those more intelligent than me.\nHow did they do it?\nHow did they articulate their thoughts so well?\nHow did they say what I\u2019ve been thinking for years but couldn\u2019t string into words?\nHow did they hold high-level conversations with a sense of understanding that leaves you feeling awestruck, but like you are so far below them on the level of knowledge?\nI\u2019ve tried to emulate the voice of the stoics, ancients, and modern masters. Soon I realized that language evolved for a reason. We have a more diverse toolset to pierce through the noise and acquire truth.\nThe poeticism of Watts.\nThe pithy advice of Seneca.\nThe crypticism of Nietsche.\nThe elegance of Peterson.\nThere was a gravity to their words that stuck in the back of my head.\nIn reflection, it led me to where I am today.\nI always wanted to do something creative.\nI knew that I didn\u2019t want to earn a living from my body, or my time for that matter. I had to earn with my mind.\nThis led me down a brutal path of life and business failures that led to the discovery and cultivation of high-value skills.\nDesign, marketing, sales, technology, programming, writing, film, and more that trained my mind for creative problem-solving.\nToday, I am grateful to say that I can earn a living and sustain a high quality of life by moving two levers: the inputs and outputs of my mind.\nIn this letter, I want to discuss 4 big ideas:\nYour mental body and how it rules your life.\nHow mental bodybuilding is your path to intelligence.\nWhy mental real estate is the most valuable resource.\nHow to monetize your mind to create your own source of income.\nMental aesthetics is your master key to the doors of the good life.\nI \u2013 The Mental Body\nIn the book Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Waltz, there\u2019s a phenomenon that surgery patients radically change their lives after changing their physical appearance.\nMany patients went on to achieve their wildest dreams.\nThe dreams they didn\u2019t think were possible before, even if the \u201cblemish\u201d that held them back was as simple as a bump on their nose (that was unnoticeable to the average eye).\nBut it wasn\u2019t the physical appearance that made the difference.\nIt was the change in self-image.\nA change in the body they held as a mental construct, one that often didn\u2019t reflect their physical appearance.\nThis brings up the principle of expectations vs reality.\nHumans tend to latch onto thoughts, ideas, and beliefs to make sense of the world and aid their survival.\nWe hold an idea of the past or future in our mind, and if present reality doesn\u2019t match, tension is the result.\nTension narrows the mind and creates stress.\nIt prevents you from seeing the world as it is, because it isn\u2019t supposed to be anything other than what it\u2019s being.\nWhen we hold an image of who we think we are in our mind, even when we\u2019ve never directly seen our own face outside of external reflections, anything that challenges that image is seen as a threat.\nEven fitness models voted to have the most aesthetic physique in the eyes of the masses have body dysmorphia.\nHell, even I have body dysmorphia after being in the gym for 10 years.\nThe image of who they are does not match their appearance.\nThis influences how we perceive and interpret the world around us.\nSomething as simple as the idea of an unhealthy meal can send a fitness model into an emotional spiral of rage, self-hatred due to a past binge, and the urge to preach that all people should abide by the diet ideology that they subscribe to.\nThe same holds true for everything we think we are.\nFrom religious beliefs to budgeting techniques to the business models and jobs that allow us to survive, our identity turns sour when we create permanence in our minds that does not match the impermanence of life.\nI.i \u2013 Conceptual Survival\nAs above, so below.\nHumans survive on both the physical and mental planes of existence.\nYes, if there is a bear charging towards you, your life flashes before your eyes.\nBut even then, I would argue that humans only survive on the mental plane of existence.\nWhen a bear charges toward you, you aren\u2019t really worried about your physical body. You\u2019re worried about the idea of it.\nYou\u2019re also worried about the friends, family, career, and whatever other idea you will lose that flood your mind in time before your life ends.\nYour \u201cself\u201d is what you are trying to survive.\nAnd if it\u2019s threatened, you feel it.\nIf you are attached to a sports team and someone says that team sucks, how do you feel?\nIf you are subscribed to a specific religion and someone tells you theirs is better, how do you feel? Do you want to replicate what\u2019s in your mind into theirs through communication so your mental offspring can survive in hopes that you convert them?\nIf you identify as a coffee drinker and run out of coffee, is your day ruined?\nIn reality, all is well.\nYou aren\u2019t in true danger, and your physical body changes on a cellular level every second. You are not your body, because your body is 100% different than it was 7 years ago. You are consciousness.\nWhen you attempt to make anything permanent you increase the chances of suffering.\nTo play the game of life you must choose what is worth suffering for and dedicate your life to that.\nSuccessful people use their emotions. Unsuccessful people are used by them.\nI.ii \u2013 The Lesson: Releasing Concepts\nSelf-development is cognitive development.\nTo develop, expand, and grow yourself \u2013 not to be confused with inflating your ego \u2013 you must release the ideas that prevent you from rising up like sandbags tied to a hot air balloon.\nWhen you feel tension, stress, or negative emotions arise you must train yourself to pause.\nThis is a lifelong pursuit of mindfulness.\nIt is a habit that must be adopted to achieve the good life.\nIt is not optional.\nWhen you pause, identify both the expectation in your mind and the reality of the situation.\nWe don\u2019t want to be at war with life, we want to be at one with it.\nWe don\u2019t want to fight with it, but flow with it.\nLet go of the irrational beliefs that hold you back and act regardless of how you feel, because you can.\nII \u2013 Mental Bodybuilding\nWhen most people have a sense of self that is the product of the external world, you have the chance to peel back the layers. You can build a self that is a conscious, personal creation that works less, earns more, and enjoys life. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nThe highest-paid individuals are the strategists, visionaries, and true creatives of the world.\nThe most fulfilled individuals are the ones who have control over their minds.\nThe people who get what they want have developed a self that makes their ideal future inevitable.\nYour \u201cself\u201d is an idea.\nA concept.\nA set of beliefs that are conditioned into your mind through learning. And when we are young, we absorb external information like a sponge.\nThis information is often passed down by your parents who were influenced by society, the government, and culture \u2013 especially if they don\u2019t question those beliefs.\nThis is exactly how you live a mediocre life.\nBy doing what everyone else tells you to do.\nBy letting your attention be stolen from you.\nBy waking up one day after doing exactly what you were told would lead to happiness, but only having unhappiness to show for it.\nMental bodybuilding is the act of chiseling your psychic body to the point of ideal outcomes in health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nTo craft your ideal mental physique, accept that the path will be painful.\nRight now \u201cyou\u201d are a blob of limitations that were projected on you.\nYour job is to become aware of these limitations, release them, and increase your complexity of self.\n\u201cComplexity of self\u201d is the knowledge, skill, and beliefs you have that determines the amount of clarity you can generate as you navigate life.\nA clear mind is an asset in an unclear world.\nClarity, or making sense, or ordered consciousness is the prime ingredient for life enjoyment.\nThe problem is that most people are anxious, overwhelmed, and uncertain when it comes to doing what they want.\nII.i \u2013 Information Metabolism\nLife is experience and experience is information.\nYour mind dictates your quality of life because your development dictates how you process information, or how you process life.\nWhen you are overwhelmed with information, you feel anxious.\nWhen you are underwhelmed with information, you feel bored.\nTo maximize the flow of information, think of your mind as the digestive system of reality.\nIf you eat too much or don\u2019t move enough, you won\u2019t metabolize that experience.\nIf you eat too little or move too much, you get hungry and agitated.\nWhen you eat just enough, you create an environment that is conducive to mental muscle growth. You trek through reality toward your goals. You enter a season of pure progress, and the feeling is incredible.\nII.ii \u2013 Bulking & Cutting\nIn fitness, you build muscle by creating an environment conducive to muscle growth.\nYou need ample food, sleep, intensity of training, and consistency.\nYou will gain a bit of fat along the way. This is inevitable if you want to see noticeable results.\nAt some point, you start feeling off.\nYou feel groggy and slow, and you don\u2019t like how soft you look in the mirror.\nTo reveal the newly built muscle, you change your environment to reflect your new goal.\nYou decrease the amount of food you eat \u2013 or increase the amount of training you do \u2013 in a way that maintains the muscle you\u2019ve built in your bulking phase.\nA key point:\nYou need a conscious goal for each chapter of life.\nA goal provides both vision and a narrative that orders your mind.\nThe two main themes of a chapter will be consistency or intensity.\nA goal, vision, and narrative for your life provides you with a perceptual filter to digest the right information. We can think of these as the mechanisms for nutrient partitioning.\nWhen you utilize the right parts of the information you consume, you build muscle faster than you would otherwise.\nTo build your mental physique, you must push the boundaries of the unknown.\nTry new things, fly across the country, start the business, and flood yourself with information so you can filter the insight that allows you to do those things well.\nWhen you hit a wall, peel back.\nRest, recover, and shed your mind of the fat you\u2019ve acquired along the way through awareness and understanding.\nIt\u2019s okay to take a break after a chapter of progress.\nII.iii \u2013 Training The Mind\nShort-form content is the current language of the internet.\nThe average individual has trained their mind to think small, remain narrow, and have difficulty seeing into a positive future.\nTraining your mind is training your the idea of your self.\nYour self, or identity, is limited by your worldview.\nTo expand who we are to the point of vast knowledge, experience, and expertise we must expand our minds beyond superficial pleasures and problems.\nRead longer books. Listen to longer podcasts. Have deeper conversations with those close to you.\nBreak out of the mindless cycle of circulating the ideas of sex, money, and indulgence without a philosophical backbone of mastery.\nRemember, you need a goal for your life.\nAn aim.\nSomething to move towards and align your decision-making with.\nThis will be useful for your mental output.\nConsumption can only go so far without creation.\nIt\u2019s like over-eating without lifting. Most of it will be stored as fat. You don\u2019t utilize the nutrients to their maximum effect.\nReading, listening, and consuming must be balanced with writing, speaking, and building a product that contributes to humanity. That is how you find connection and fulfillment.\nWe will tie all of this together into practical steps at the end of this letter. Stay with me.\nII.iv \u2013 Meaningful Events\nWhen the flow of information is maximized in your life through the balance of consumption and creation, you will encounter meaningful events.\nYou will feel a deep sense of excitement for the future, fulfillment in the present, and gratitude for the past.\nThese feelings should be seen as an opportunity to document the important parts of your life that you can share with others.\nWhen you read a good book and stumble across a lesson that sparks excitement, write it down.\nWhen you feel fulfilled in the present because of the progress you are making, write it down.\nWhen you feel grateful that your past has led you to this moment, despite your mistakes, write it down.\nAs your notes of signal grow, you have data from which you can replicate those experiences.\nYou can condition your mind to occupy these states of consciousness as a baseline.\nYour quality of life increases to a point of high stability.\nII.v \u2013 The Lesson: Explore The Unknown\nYou aren\u2019t where you want to be because you\u2019ve been where you are for a bit too long.\nThe way you expand your mind (and potential) is by solving the problems that stand in the way of your goals.\nYour goals lie in the unknown.\nThe thought of the unknown creates tension and fear.\nWhat is it costing you to put off solving the problems in your life?\nPerson 1 decides to solve the problem in a day.\nPerson 2 decides to put up with the pain of stagnation and either solve it in a month, or not at all.\nPerson 1 will achieve 30 goals by the time person 2 achieves 1.\nYou hate your job, but its pain is not stronger than your fear of the unknown, so you don\u2019t pursue the goal of doing your own thing.\nYou hate where you live, but not enough to do what\u2019s required to move out.\nYou hate your partner, but not enough to develop a bit of self-respect.\nSnap out of your narrow way of living.\nFall in love with the lessons you learn from relentlessly pursuing your goals.\nIII \u2013 Mental Real Estate\nWhether they be positive or negative, the ideas that occupy the collective mental real estate will influence the progress we make as a species. The future belongs to those that can capture and hold attention with valuable information for the most amount of time possible. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nWho wrote the code in your head?\nThat is to say, who fed you the information, ideas, beliefs, perspectives, and worldviews that create your sense of self?\nLet\u2019s consider your \u201cself\u201d as an intellectual construct.\nA psychic body.\nA house that can be occupied, nurtured, or destroyed by the tenants you allow to live there rent-free.\nIn comes the internet.\nIn comes social media.\nJust like that, we have thousands upon thousands of ideas shaping who we are, how we act, and what we care about on a daily basis.\nMost people don\u2019t even know why they are doing what they are doing.\nThat alone is a great way to audit your life.\nIf you don\u2019t know why you are going to that class, going to that job, marrying that person, or doing anything that you do, you did not create yourself.\nSustained long-term focus is a lost art in a distracted world, and it\u2019s wreaking havoc on our ability to achieve anything meaningful.\nIII.i \u2013 Flipping The Social Switch\nSocial media is the devil if you perceive it that way.\nSocial media is the vessel for your potential if you perceive it that way.\nHow you perceive opportunities depends on your self-development.\nYou won\u2019t see a viral social media post as inspiration if you don\u2019t identify as a writer.\nYou won\u2019t see a business owner\u2019s complaint as a potential lead if you don\u2019t identify as a consultant or service business owner.\nMost people see cliche advice as \u201ccringe\u201d because they identify as mediocre thanks to an abundance of self-deprecating memes occupying their worldview.\nSocial media is the virtual reality to achieve your potential.\nEntrepreneurship is the only logical option for long-term thinkers.\nA personal brand is an extension of your character, the self you continue to develop.\nYour goals are what attract like-minded players.\nYour problems, when solved, are how you help others in the form of a product or service.\nYour ideas are the posts that occupy the mental real estate of your followers and shape their sense of self.\nWriting and speaking your beautiful mind to the masses through social media is how you check the boxes of a fulfilling life.\nIII.ii \u2013 Reproduction Through Spirit\nWhen you have children, you create a \u201cself.\u201d\nYes, their physical body has your \u201cblood,\u201d but who they are is a result of the ideas you inject into their mind.\nWith that knowledge, we are reproducing on a spiritual level every day.\nEach conversation you have, idea you spread, or belief you defend is for the sake of conceptual survival.\nYour sense of self becomes immortal because your ideas live in the minds of others. They shape the selves of the world.\nThis is why writing, speaking, and building a business is so rewarding. You feel that sense of connection and fulfillment that comes from impacting lives at scale.\nIII.iii \u2013 We Are In A Spiritual War\nThose who occupy the most mental real estate hold the most power in the modern world.\nThink of James Clear.\nMost people are aware of his book Atomic Habits.\nIf James posted the word \u201chabits,\u201d he would get thousands of likes and reposts.\nIf anyone else posted that word, even with the same amount of followers, they would get much less engagement.\nThis brings up a few lessons:\nThe longer you hold attention, the more power your ideas hold. Books will always reign supreme. Podcasts and long videos come second. Short content comes last. But all have their use cases.\nYour ideas must spark positive behavior change. If you change someone\u2019s life, they will credit you over and over for your success. Meaning, your ideas spread without people consuming your work.\nWhen your ideas change lives, you hold attention longer. If someone is forming new habits, James Clear\u2019s ideas will occupy their mind throughout the day, which shapes their identity. They become a half-child of Clear.\nShort-form writing is for initial attention capture and audience growth. Long-form writing is for nurturing the mind and self of the reader.\nBoth are necessary, but short writing without long writing will trap you in a feast or famine cycle. Your ideas will not live in people\u2019s heads for long.\nPeople try to talk about whatever they want online and fail because they don\u2019t understand this realization.\nIf I write a book (this is why I did) I can expand my language online and stop relying on \u201cproven\u201d or \u201chigh-performing\u201d topics to grow.\nBut beginners can\u2019t skip this step.\nUnless you are a best-selling offer, your content needs to follow an attention progression. You must emulate validated ideas (like viral tweets or videos) while slowly building authority with long-form media.\nWhen it comes to business, your life\u2019s work, or just writing online it is a spiritual war of ideas.\nEngagement tactics and growth hacks are helpful to spread your ideas, but will those ideas live on through eternity by the selves they create?\nIII.iv \u2013 The Spirituality Of Entrepreneurship\nSelf-development is a gateway drug into entrepreneurship because you realize that improving others is the next level of improving yourself.\nAttention is the root of your being.\nIt is both reality and your connection to it.\nImproving yourself is improving where you focus your attention.\nMost people are focused on the next pleasurable experience. Wise people are focused on the problems that the pleasure seekers are hiding from.\nFind a problem.\nLearn how to solve it.\nDocument how you solved it.\nDistill into a replicable process.\nGive it to others that want to be helped.\nDo it offline and it\u2019s called growth.\nDo it online and it\u2019s called business.\nSpirituality is feeling like you are a part of something greater than yourself. It is reuniting with the one thing that has always been: the unity and connection of all things.\nBusiness is spirituality in that you are attempting to raise the collective consciousness or development through the exchange of goods.\nIII.v \u2013 Action Steps\nStudy that which generates attention.\nPsychology, media, design, writing, marketing, sales, persuasion, influence, and the mind.\nStudy yourself.\nYour thoughts, emotions, actions, and follow them to their root. What goals, problems, and beliefs have others projected on you that led to those thoughts, emotions, and actions?\nThis may sound like a lot, but you have an entire lifetime to make this work, no?\nWhat\u2019s the only other option? Distracting yourself with mind-numbing pleasures that entrench you in the same boring life?\nThe only pain greater than seeing what you are capable of is not seeing what you are capable of.\nYour education should, and must, reflect that.\nIV \u2013 Mental Monetization\nIt\u2019s 2023.\nYou have the resources to revamp your education, enhance your skill set, and change the source of your income in less time than it would take to get a college degree.\nBut there\u2019s a trap that many fall into.\nThey attempt to monetize the vane, superficial, or rapid.\nThey post half-naked pictures just to lose their income source when they can\u2019t sustain their unhealthy eating patterns.\nThey study the algorithm rather than human nature just to lose their income when technology changes.\nThey study the \u201cbest business models of 2023\u201d rather than marketing, sales, persuasion, and distribution just to lose income when the economy shifts.\nIt is better to realize early that intelligence is a more sustainable monetization lever.\nCreativity, wisdom, development, and character can be the source of your income if you protect your mind.\nIV.i \u2013 What To Study\nLet\u2019s take a big-picture approach to the skills that will bring you success going into the future.\nThe 3 applications we want to master are social media, offer creation, and driving traffic. These are how your skills will be channeled and your learning will be filtered.\nYou must build a brand, offer, and practice driving traffic between the two. That\u2019s how you make money.\nWhen you learn the skills below, learn them from the lens of what you are building. Filter the information through the lens of a social media brand, driving traffic, and creating a great product.\nIV.i.i \u2013 Evergreen Skills\nWriting, speaking, marketing, and sales are how you structure and distribute the value you provide to the world.\nSocial media posts, newsletters, video scripts, and all other media is written or spoken.\nThey are then enhanced with marketing and sales knowledge because they are based on psychological principles of attention capture and value perception.\nThese are not optional.\nAvoid learning any other skills first.\nTrue learning stems from struggle, not memorization.\nYou must start building, NOT learning, and when you encounter a problem, study writing, speaking, marketing, and sales courses and content.\nIV.i.ii \u2013 Results Oriented Skills\nWhen you have a solid grasp on the evergreen skills, you can choose to enhance them with other results-oriented skills.\nThese include but are not limited to any other skill that will make your social media, traffic generation, or offer better:\nGraphic design\nWeb design and development\nSearch engine optimization\nEmail marketing\nSocial media marketing agencies\nAny other business or skill people tell you to learn or start.\nAll of these will be made effective by the evergreen skills.\nLearning them by themselves will prime you for replacement.\nSince you are building a personal brand as your character in the new virtual reality, you are building a skill set that transfers over into any other business.\nWhen you have a knowledge of 100, you can create a product or service of 1.\nThe more skills and experience you have with your own brand, the more opportunities become available to you.\nPeople will tell you to build a business before starting on social media. I believe that is a quick way to a life of unnecessary pain because you don\u2019t understand social media.\nIV.ii \u2013 Dissecting Your Mind For Topics\nIf a mind is composed of ideas that form thoughts, beliefs, and actions \u2013 it makes sense to break them into their individual parts, study them, enhance them, and reprogram the way you think.\nWhat are your goals?\nWrite about the benefits of achieving them.\nWhat are the problems standing in the way?\nWrite about the emotions involved in overcoming them.\nWhat skills do you have to acquire to reach your goals?\nWrite about how you are applying those skills and what you\u2019ve learned.\nWhat are 10-20 things you are genuinely curious to learn?\nStudy them and share the big ideas that you feel compelled to share with someone else but in your own words.\nWhat are the topics and interests you already consume?\nI love watching, reading, and listening to content on psychology, spirituality, metaphysics, business, mindset, mental models, and more.\nCreate a topic tree with 3 broad interests, break it down into topics, and then break it down further into writing ideas.\nThen, use those as a starting point for distilling lessons as you learn the evergreen skills.\nAre you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced?\n99% of the market are beginners.\nThis is often a struggle point for people of all levels.\nThink about what you consume and how you consume it.\nOn social media, I love reading beginner-level advice. It reminds me of the fundamentals I need to focus on.\nIf I want to learn something more advanced, I don\u2019t try to find it on social media. I have a much higher search intent. I am going to search for it directly and/or purchase a book or course.\nWith this knowledge, even if you are advanced, write for beginners.\nAnd if you are a beginner, rest assured that people will benefit from learning from your journey.\nSocial media is a collective mind.\nYour job is to display your character as your brand and document your mind with your writing.\nObserve your thoughts and attempt to turn your experiences into lessons.\nI help you with all of this in 2 Hour Writer.\nYour clarity of thought will shoot through the roof.\nIV.iii \u2013 Iterating On Your Big Ideas\nFor every 100 pieces you write only a handful will be good.\nThis is the nature of everything in life, trial and error.\nYou have to be okay with failure because success wouldn\u2019t exist without it.\nPay close attention to your best ideas.\nThe ones you like the most or perform the best.\nEvery month, review your writing and save the best ones.\nThen, rewrite them from a place of higher experience.\nYou can be sure that your posts will start to perform better and better when you do this.\nEventually, your mind thinks in terms of your best ideas. This is how authors, speakers, podcasters, and the rest sound so articulate.\nThey\u2019ve trained their mind to operate on big ideas.\nIV.iv \u2013 Creating A Data-Driven Product\nYour mental monetization journey will provide you with a lot of feedback (that you won\u2019t receive if you don\u2019t start).\nPay attention to:\nHow your best ideas perform. If the idea performs well, it probably means a product or service will also do well based on that idea.\nHow others\u2019 products and ideas perform. You have to become an observer over a consumer. View social media content, landing pages, funnels, products, services, and promotions as inspirational firepower for your own. Sell what\u2019s already selling, but under your own name and worldview.\nWhat people tell you they want. As you grow your readers will become vocal about what they want from you and what was helpful. Double down on this.\nThe questions people ask. You will notice patterns in the problems people have. The more questions you get, the bigger the problem, and the more likely people are to pay you for help.\nYou can monetize anything you want nowadays.\nI\u2019ve talked about this many times before in the one-person business playlist on YouTube.\nBut the best route you can take is to solve your own problems and sell the solution.\nEveryone has the same goals and problems.\nThey just view them through different perspectives and worldviews.\nYou want financial freedom, health, vitality, love, and every benefit of improving your health, wealth, and relationships.\nOne person will try budgeting, the other will build a side hustle.\nWhat you do to achieve your goals is completely different from how someone else will.\nYour job is to attract people like you by talking about your journey.\nThen, package up your path to achieving the goal and sell it.\nThis is how you build a beautiful mind.\nUnderstand your mental body.\nTrain that body like you would in the gym.\nKnow that modern power comes from attention or mental real estate.\nUse writing and business as a vessel for self-understanding and monetization.\nEnjoy the rest of your weekend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "I\u2019m building a software company.\nBut I\u2019m taking a different approach.\nThe common route would be to build the product, test it, and market it to a specific audience.\nThis works, but I want to skip the \u201csink or swim\u201d phase of this business.\nI am well aware that churn, developer costs, and engraining software in people\u2019s daily lives will be difficult.\nInstead, I plan to take the company to $5-$10 million in its first year.\n(February 2, 2024 edit: we are well on track for this)\nA lofty goal, yes.\nBut how?\nBy leveraging the experience I\u2019ve gained in modern business.\nI know the power of a personal brand. I know the power of digital products (and how a $10M digital product business is more profitable than most $50M physical product businesses). I know that I can use both to create an education product as the main driver of revenue in our first year of business \u2013 with that product operating at 95% profit margins.\nWe will build the company\u2019s social media like we would a personal brand \u2013 with an \u201cavatar\u201d as the face of the brand. Most businesses have no idea what it takes to build an actual social media audience, so they rely on creator sponsorships. We want to create a creator.\nWe will use that audience, and a plethora of creator audiences, to fuel a cohort-based course around the subject of our software.\nAt that point, it doesn\u2019t matter if the software itself is profitable in the first year. We can play long-term and slowly inject it into the creator economy as the one true second-brain software.\nBut, this letter isn\u2019t about the software.\nIt\u2019s about how you can start a hyper-profitable education business with the knowledge in your head.\nYou don\u2019t need to build software to make this work.\nOf course, you can build software based around the profitable education product you sell to enhance your business results (if you want to down the road \u2013 because you\u2019ll have the money to invest in one).\nHere\u2019s what to expect:\nWhy a social media audience is the highest leverage business asset.\nHow to create your own customers (rather than trying to \u201cfind\u201d them with boring market research).\nRealizing that you have $100,000 stuck in your head (and how to extract it).\nIf you want the full philosophy for the future of work, pick up The Art of Focus book on Amazon.\nAudience Building Is The Greatest Skill Of The Decade\nPersonal brands are the new wave that won\u2019t die out.\nIt\u2019s not a phase, mom.\nThe digital world is expanding faster than the physical, and personal brands are the avatars that occupy the space.\nEveryone has a personal brand. Everyone is in the creator economy. But few realize that their contributions (posts and products) aren\u2019t contributions at all.\nConsumers are too busy posting about their lives to impress friends who aren\u2019t really friends.\nCreators are learning, building, and distilling valuable information that makes life better for everyone.\nThe Realization Of Owned Distribution\nI\u2019m connected with and follow many high-level entrepreneurs.\nSome in private equity, some in agency work, and some in software or related fields.\nIn almost every single conversation we have, the point of owned distribution comes up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t start posting content sooner.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane how much the marketing world has changed in a few short years, a personal brand is becoming less and less optional.\u201d\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for other types of distribution:\nManual \u2013 like cold email, cold calls, or cold direct message campaigns.\nBought \u2013 like purchasing Facebook or Google ads.\nBorrowed \u2013 like paying for podcast, YouTube, or newsletter sponsorships.\nOwned \u2013 like building an audience, newsletter, community, or list of product buyers.\nThe lines are blurred between them all, and I missed a few things like SEO, but they all have their use cases.\nThe first 3 are incredible for testing, beginner business owners, and having some form of control over your outcomes.\nOwned distribution is a long-term game that scares most people away.\nLet\u2019s imagine I spent 2 years building a 100,000-person audience.\nIf I promoted my product every day for a month (in a smart way) I would get at least a million impressions.\nHow long would it take me to direct message a million people? A long time.\nHow much money would it cost for me to reach that many people with ads? Around $7,000 a month (based on $7 as an average CPM).\nNot to mention, owned distribution compounds.\nYou can get to 10-20k followers in a year, 50-100k in two years, and millions after 4-5 years. That is, if you know how to iterate on your best content\u2026 or even write content in the first place.\nIt only makes sense to systemize your audience growth with time and leverage other distribution methods to make your desired revenue.\nOnce you see the power of personality, owned distribution, and flexibility of a personal brand \u2013 there\u2019s no going back.\nAudience Building Is A Stack Of High-Value Skills\nTo become a good audience builder, you can\u2019t just study \u201caudience building.\u201d\nThis is the case for most skills that get abnormal results.\nIt\u2019s not as simple as looking up a video on \u201cthe best skills to learn in 2023,\u201d because that\u2019s what everyone else is doing. It\u2019s a great way to commoditize yourself and be replaceable.\nAudience building is a stack of today\u2019s most profitable skills:\nGraphic design\nContent writing\nCopywriting\nMarketing & sales\nHuman nature\nPsychology\nSelf-awareness\nNetworking\nAnd it demands multidisciplinary study and expertise.\nAudience building is a lifestyle.\nIt is the act of capturing, curating, connecting, creating, and distributing valuable information, resources, and products in a way that impacts positive behavior change.\nIf you don\u2019t pursue a better life for yourself, you will fail.\nA better life demands the habits of learning, building, and distributing.\nRapid Fire Tips To Start Learning, Building & Distributing\nHere is exactly what you must do (without the fluff).\nThese must become habit.\nThat means a part of your everyday life.\nIf you can spend 8 hours building someone else\u2019s dreams, you can spend 1 hour building your own.\nIf you don\u2019t have 1 hour a day to invest in having 2 hours a day, and so on, you need to get your priorities straight.\nLearning with intention:\nLearn the principles of marketing, sales, writing, and social media. Binge-watch 30-50 hours of free content and paid courses. Build your personal brand along the way so you actually apply what you learn.\nStudy what interests you. Do not limit yourself. If you have the goal of building a better life for yourself, anything you learn will be from that lens. You are still \u201cfocusing on one thing.\u201d\nWhen you feel the excitement, or dopamine, that comes from discovering a novel idea, write it down. Refine that idea and post it to your profile.\nBuild for yourself:\nPursue your goals and document the process. By document, I mean to keep running notes, logs, successes, and failures somewhere safe, physical or digital.\nFrom your journey, you gain a knowledge of 100. From that, you can create a path of 1. This is how you pass down a unique system that markets itself and gets better results than those looking to make a quick buck.\nAlong the way, post the advice, lessons, and authentic successes and failures you\u2019ve experienced. This is called \u201cbuilding in public.\u201d Don\u2019t do it for others. Do it as a digital journal. It will pay off.\nDistribute a purposeful product:\nMost people don\u2019t realize that products are authority catalysts. They think they are \u201cselling out\u201d by selling a product, but don\u2019t realize that it adds perceived authority to their brand, and they gain more loyal followers.\nCreate a product that you need, or needed, in your life. Something that would have helped you achieve where you are now, or something that will help you achieve something faster. This can be clothes for style, courses for knowledge, journal for productivity, or anything in between.\nSell to yourself and you won\u2019t have to worry about competition.\nCustomer Creation Through Education\nI don\u2019t agree with 99% of business gurus out there.\nMost of the hyper-successful ones are old and out of touch. Most of the young ones never question what the old ones say and forge a new path.\nIt is common advice to \u201cbuild a product for a starving market, then attract that market as your audience.\u201d\nYes, obviously this works.\nBut it also comes with the downsides of:\nHating your customer base and not feeling motivated to work.\nNot having autonomy over what you write and build.\nNot being able to pivot into whatever topic or interest you are curious about.\nBeing forced into a specific identity, which spills over into the entirety of your life.\nWhen you prioritize education in your brand through courses, content, cohorts, and coaching (all optional), you unlock the ability to create your own customers.\nHumans Are Learning Machines\nWhy does a starving market desire what they desire?\nWhy are they willing to pull out their card and pay for something they perceive as valuable?\nWhy are you told to \u201cniche down\u201d so you can get specific on the problem you leverage in your marketing?\nBecause of social conditioning, learning, and education.\nYou target a specific person because they are educated to have that identity.\nTheir identity influences what they desire (because of who they surround themselves with and what they see as opportunity).\nWhen you create identities through education, by leading people towards your vision through your narrative, people grow to desire the product that will help them reach that goal.\nThe Levels Of Awareness\nThere is a marketing concept called the \u201clevels of awareness\u201d that will change your life.\nIt is a simple copywriting framework popularized by Eugene Schwartz in his book Breakthrough Advertising.\nIt doesn\u2019t only apply to marketing, but everything.\nEvolution is about solving problems in the macrocosm. Personal growth is about solving problems in the microcosm. Business is about solving problems to bridge the gap between the two.\nBusiness is your contribution to humanity.\nIt is how you fulfill your life\u2019s purpose of raising your consciousness (or awareness) and letting that impact the world like a ripple in water.\nThere are 5 levels of awareness:\nUnaware \u2013 unaware of the problem.\nProblem aware \u2013 aware of the problem.\nSolution aware \u2013 aware of a solution(s) to the problem.\nProduct aware \u2013 aware of your solution to the problem.\nMost aware \u2013 aware of the vast impact that problem is having on their quality of life.\nYour job as an education brand is to hit all of these levels.\nYou must make your audience aware of the problems you\u2019ve solved in your life (and how that problem impacts their life).\nYou must give advice, lessons, and tips to show that there is a solution.\nYou must market a product that solves the problem faster just by the nature of invested attention.\nPeople don\u2019t log on to social media to solve their problems. It isn\u2019t a learning platform. And most people can\u2019t focus, research, and figure out a path for themselves.\nThat is why products are valuable.\nBecause people know they are investing in a solution. Then, their attention and behavior follow suit.\nFree education only works for the 1% that have been conditioned to be motivated and ambitious. Even they still see the value in aggregated information, and will probably buy out of convenience.\nThe Balance Of Long-Form & Short-Form\nFor the uninitiated, there are 2 main types of content (and communication).\nLong-form \u2013 podcasts, videos, articles, newsletters, conversations, movies, and sometimes long social posts like threads.\nShort-form \u2013 tweets, shorts, reels, texts, emails, big ideas, and your favorite quotes.\nEach has its pros and cons, but long term, they are both necessary to build an audience that trusts you. Trust is the \u201cnew\u201d sales hack that people are starting to catch onto.\nShort-form is for capturing attention, building a large audience, and funneling that audience to deeper sources of value (long-form platforms, products, and services).\nLong-form is for holding invested attention, segmenting your audience, and building trust through expertise.\nThe balance of both forces you to have value to deliver. If you don\u2019t have a habit of self-education, building products or systems, and using writing as a way to clarify your thoughts and ideas \u2013 you are delaying the inevitable.\nI am aware that most of my readers are beginners.\nFor you, I recommend starting with one long-form channel and one short-form.\nEventually, when you do this full-time and systemize your process you can repurpose those to all platforms.\nFor long-form, I recommend a newsletter. Why?\nYou can practice when nobody is watching.\nYou can build a database of content to repurpose into blogs, YouTube, and solo podcasts.\nLong-form builds depth and connection with your audience so you don\u2019t have to rely on pushy sales tactics to make a living.\nYou are forced to develop original ideas that spill over into your short-form content.\nFor short-form, I recommend a writing platform like X. Why?\nYou don\u2019t have to show your face or body (having a headshot as your profile picture helps of course).\nYou learn to monetize your mind instead of your looks. Your income depends on your creativity.\nYou can test multiple ideas each day and repurpose your best ones to other platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn to grow faster.\nYou can use your writing as scripts for shorts, reels, and TikToks.\nI teach this entire process in 2 Hour Writer.\nStart with 30 minutes of writing each morning.\nWrite a long-form newsletter. Use the ideas you write about as short posts. Eventually, let your engagement data act as a compass for what you write more about.\nYou Have $100,000 Trapped In Your Head\nI wrote an entire letter about how to package up the knowledge in your head to create a $100,000 product. Give it a read if you don\u2019t want to stop after this letter.\nFirst, let\u2019s handle the prime objection of information products in general:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not tangible.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just words on a screen.\u201d\nIf the root of your existence (and quality of life) is your mind, and your mind is an information processing machine, and the information you consume heavily influences where you end up in life (and the people\u2019s lives you impact) \u2013 information products are the greatest product one can sell.\nAnyone who tells you otherwise has not thought it through or experienced the business model. They are conditioned by their favorite guru\u2019s worldview and can\u2019t escape it.\nI am moving toward the belief that every single business should have a foundation of education.\nEvery single business should have an information product to distribute positive behavior change at scale.\nNot to mention, the fact that they have 95%+ profit margins is a sign that the economy will continue to favor the education market. Technology and evolution have led us to this point, and who are you to question Mother Nature?\nHow To Eliminate All Saturation\nBuild a product for your past self or current self.\nOne that accelerates the progress made toward a meaningful goal.\nYour marketing will revolve around the Universal principle of human behavior:\nPurpose \u2013 a compelling reason to move toward a better future.\nPath \u2013 a process, system, or steps that bring clarity to their actions.\nPriority \u2013 the burning problem they face at their level of awareness.\nIf you like productivity, create a workflow with education around that.\nIf you like spirituality, create meditations with education around that.\nIf you like fitness, create a program with education around that.\nYou can\u2019t improve what doesn\u2019t exist, so don\u2019t stress the first iteration. This is a long game of improvement.\n\u201cBut what about my customer avatar and market research?\u201d\nIt\u2019s you.\nYou are the niche.\nYou are the customer avatar.\nWrite the content and promotions that would speak to you.\nThere are a lot of moving pieces to this. It will take a year or so to actually feel like you are getting the hang of it.\nBut don\u2019t make the mistake and thinking that this is a unique case. Every single thing you\u2019ve done in life has been a process of trial and error.\nJust because you are older and have psychological barriers built up doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t build a business like you learned to walk.\nI hope you enjoyed this one, my friends.\nHave a great weekend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "I remember waking up at 3 a.m. so I could play games before I had to go to high school.\nFrom Halo 3 and Call Of Duty to World Of Warcraft and League Of Legends.\nI was addicted, to say the least.\nIncreasing my level in video games took priority over increasing my level in reality.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\nHow else would I be able to write this newsletter?\nPsychology, metaphysics, self-help, and modern business all point to life being a video game.\nIn a metaphorical sense, of course. I\u2019m not saying that the underlying fabric of the Universe is a giant computer that aliens built before humans existed\u2026 but it\u2019s quite similar as we will learn (and I\u2019m not completely closed off to that idea. Who actually knows?).\nI want to break down each perspective so you can:\nMake progress toward your goals (and fall in love with the process)\nUnderstand how to tap into optimal states of consciousness\nStop taking life so seriously and create your ideal future\nReinvent yourself or the character that plays the game of life\nLeverage your character to pursue your life\u2019s work and earn a meaningful income\nA game is a structured flow of information.\nLife is in-formation, and our quality of life depends on our ability to process it.\nWhen we push too far beyond our edge, too far into the unknown, there is too much stimulus. We can\u2019t metabolize the experience. Information builds up and creates anxiety and overwhelm.\nWhen we shy too far away from our edge, too far into the known, there is little novelty that makes life worth living. Our mind is not stimulated. Information is easy to digest and we become bored.\nThe conscious mind can process 50 bits of information per second.\nThe unconscious mind can manage 11 million bits of information per second.\nAs we become more efficient at processing information, or playing the game, our unconscious grows in power, and we free up conscious attention to invest in what we deem meaningful.\nIn video games, you have a map. The light of awareness reveals where you have been and what you have experienced. This knowledge allows you to make better decisions in the future.\nThe darkness of the map is the unknown, and you wouldn\u2019t launch yourself too far from the known.\nYou must slowly puncture the unknown, let the experience normalize through skill acquisition and emotional management, and press forward.\nThe purpose of life is to raise your consciousness.\nThis is only possible by living at your edge. Embracing the story of life. The highs, lows, successes, and catastrophic failures. The most miserable place you can be is in the middle.\nPsychology: How Video Games Make You Addicted To Progress\nThe optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy\u2014or attention\u2014is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nFlow.\nYou\u2019ve heard about it before.\nThe optimal state of consciousness that all of the ancients, mystics, and psychologists point to with their teachings.\nWhere you are at one with doing or being.\nYou lose self-consciousness and move through life without a worry in the world.\nIt seems that the key to the good life is investing attention in what we deem meaningful. But what you deem meaningful is found by investing attention in what you eliminate as meaningless. This process of trial and error, high and low, focus and distraction is the natural balance that keeps life enjoyable.\nBut if you get stuck in a low, chaos ensues.\nPsychic Entropy\nOrdered consciousness is what creates degrees of the flow state.\nTo \u201corder consciousness\u201d is to focus your attention on something external or internal. A task, situation, or conversation in the external. Or a thought, emotion, or feeling in the internal.\nBoth have their benefits and change the way our brain operates.\nWhen we lose focus to a distraction, we increase the chances of entropy \u2013 the decline into chaos. Psychic entropy is when the mind tends toward a disordered state of consciousness.\nWhen we give life, or attention, to a negative thought it multiplies.\nA social media post about how eggs will cause cancer brings thoughts about your grandma\u2019s health, your diet choices, if you\u2019ve fulfilled your potential, how food affects your skin quality, what you are going to eat next, and more.\nWe can reverse entropy when we use our human ability to zoom out, gain perspective, and refocus our attention on doing or being in a direction that brings growth.\nVideo Games Order Consciousness\nThere are a lot of practical lessons we can learn by deconstructing how video games order consciousness.\nThose lessons can be used to enhance our learning, skill acquisition, and self-confidence.\nWhen you first start playing a game:\nYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\nYou go through a tutorial so you aren\u2019t exposed to everything at once.\nYou practice at level one until that level becomes boring.\nYou are introduced to more skills, traits, and abilities to practice with.\nYou progressively overload the challenges you take on until you decide to stop playing the game.\nThere must be a skill challenge match if we want to maintain order in consciousness.\nIf the challenge is too high for your skill, you get anxious.\nIf the challenge is too low for your skill, you get bored.\nSo, you start by learning the rules of the game.\nA \u201cgame\u201d represents any situation in life. Especially the ones where you lack confidence and can\u2019t see yourself winning.\nThen, you practice the mechanics of the game.\nThere are a series of steps, or quests, that provide education and practice in unison.\nRemember this when you approach anything new (or get bored with your current endeavor).\nIf you are faced with a large challenge, you need to learn and practice at your level.\nIf you are bored with your current level of challenge, you need to expose yourself to the education of the next level, practice the new skills, and enjoy the neurochemical cocktail with a double of dopamine as you transcend to the next phase of your life.\nSelf-Awareness As A Compass\nBalancing skill with challenge is the metagame you must practice.\nWhen you get bored, your mind will start to drift and think \u201cI could be doing something better with my time.\u201d\nYou tilt into self-centeredness. Refocus your attention on adding a challenge to the situation.\nEven if you work a job with the same repetitive tasks, you can make it more enjoyable by creating a more challenging game.\nYou may see daily walks as boring, but what if you add some rules? Try making it without stepping on a crack in the sidewalk.\nWhen you get anxious, your mind grasps at negative aspects of yourself.\n\u201cI\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will people think of this blemish on my face.\u201d\n\u201cI could never make that much money with my business.\u201d\nYou tilt into self-consciousness and let negative thoughts multiply.\nAgain, pause and zoom out. Refocus.\nThis will take intentional practice to make a habit.\nMetaphysics: We Live In A Survival Based Simulation\nIf you play a video game on your computer, such as \u201cDoom\u201d or \u201cUncharted\u201d, you see compelling 3D worlds with 3D objects. Yet the information is entirely 2D, limited by the number of pixels on the screen. The same is true when you look away from your computer to the world around you. It too has pixels, and all the information is 2D. \u2013 Donald Hoffman\nDonald Hoffman is a cognitive psychologist and author, notably of the book The Case Against Reality.\nIn the book (and various podcasts I\u2019ve binge listened) he argues that human perception is a \u201cuser interface\u201d that hides the true nature of reality, so that we can survive.\nNatural selection doesn\u2019t favor organisms that see reality as it is.\nThis aligns with psychedelic enthusiasts like Terrance McKenna who say that language is virtual reality. Perception is a closed system and psychedelics allow you to see beyond our fitness-based perceptions.\nSpacetime As A Compression Algorithm\nHoffman argues that space and time are a visualization tool.\nThey are the operating system of our user interface.\nThink of a desktop screen.\nSubjective reality is like a screen that is programmed to help us see what we need to see in order to do what we need to do.\nEvery \u201cmaterial\u201d object is like an icon on the screen.\nIt is pretty. It has properties and qualities. We should \u201ctake them seriously, but not literally.\u201d\nYou can click around on the screen and perform specific tasks that result in a desired outcome.\nThese desired outcomes are \u201cfitness payoffs.\u201d These payoffs are like points in a video game. Through trial and error, we learn how to win, and how to evolve. By winning, your offspring go to the next level.\nIn real-world simulations, organisms that saw the truth went extinct. Like an ant trying to mate with a glass bottle, because its perception was distorted.\nRemoving The Interface\nEveryone thinks they are seeing the truth but it\u2019s more like everyone is in the same video game like Grand Theft Auto.\nWhen we look at our computers and consoles that run these programs, they are packaged up nicely.\nWe don\u2019t see the wires and diodes that transfer information to create what is on the screen. And even if we did see it, it wouldn\u2019t serve our survival. We wouldn\u2019t understand it and wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything with the jumble of electronics.\nEven further, we can\u2019t see or comprehend the code that is running the game.\nWe can draw connections between this theory and non-duality, infinite consciousness, and mentalism / idealism.\nIf you were to remove your interface (with a tool like psychedelics or advanced meditation) you would eventually go insane. Your ego would dissolve and you would \u201clive\u201d and operate in a completely different fashion. Your physical body or avatar would stop playing the game \u2013 and you would probably die very soon.\nThere is a reason people aren\u2019t on psychedelics 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWe aren\u2019t at that phase of evolution just yet, but who knows what the future holds.\nFor now, it is wise to ground yourself in the metaphysical and act in the \u201cphysical\u201d from a place of higher perspective.\nThe Mind As A Vessel\nThe human mind is a vessel where reality flows through it.\nThink of it like a projector.\nThe light that the projector emits is consciousness.\nThe film is the mind.\nThe light shines on the film and displays a spectrum of experiences that humans have. It frames our perception.\nSelf-Help: How To Reinvent Yourself (Your Character)\nLife is a game.\nStack gold.\nAcquire skills.\nGain experience.\nUnlock new levels.\nAnd eventually, get to a point where you have the resources to do whatever you want.\nWhen your operating frame is focused on the process that will actualize your future, your focus is impenetrable, and you live in a world of your own design.\nThe difference between a video game and real life is virtual risk and real risk.\nThe sameness between a video game and real life is learning, practice, and becoming a dopamine junkie.\nVideo games have tutorials, professions, quests, and an unknown to explore.\nReal life has childhood, career paths, responsibilities, and potentials that you are unaware of \u2013 but once discovered \u2013 can drastically change how you think, act, and work.\nOnce you understand the significance of the patterns illustrated between games and life, you can begin to correct your behavior in a manner that is conducive to your ideal future.\nIncreasing The Complexity Of Self\nNo problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it. \u2013 Albert Einstein\nTo raise your consciousness you must increase your level of mind.\nTo raise your level of mind you must open your perspective.\nTo open your perspective you must identify problems, take on the challenge, acquire the skill, and receive the knowledge necessary to transcend your previous identity.\nWith each level of mind, your identity must change.\nThe knowledge, skill, belief, and experience you order in your mind as \u201cself\u201d determines the opportunities available to you.\nAt level 1, you have access to opportunities slightly above your level. The opportunities you can register in your awareness exist on a spectrum.\nAs you level up, you have access to all opportunities beneath you, and those slightly above you still.\nIt is a massive disservice to your life to distract yourself and never see what you are capable of.\nCreating The Games You Play\nIf games have a desired outcome (winning), a path to get there (progression), and habitual actions to take (priorities) then we can create games out of any situation in life.\nThis Universal principle of purpose, process, and priority is the underlying framework of human behavior.\nIf you don\u2019t have a goal, you don\u2019t have vision.\nIf you don\u2019t have a path, you don\u2019t have clarity.\nIf you don\u2019t have a task, you don\u2019t have focus.\nMost of your problems in life can be solved by understanding and applying this principle.\nTo create a game, you need a hierarchy of goals that frames your attention.\nAs an example:\nA 10 year goal (that allows your vision to blossom)\nYearly goals\nMonthly goals\nWeekly goals\nAll of which are to be loosely held in the back of your mind. They should not be your master, but your guide.\nOnly from there can you align your education and daily lever-moving actions with them.\nThe progress you make increases meaningful dopamine in the brain, it feels incredible.\nAnd if you can anchor your attention to this hierarchy of goals, most of your worries disappear.\nYou\u2019re overly focused on the negative parts of your life because you haven\u2019t built positive responsibilities that demand your focus.\nThe more attention you invest in your goals, the stronger their gravity becomes.\nAll Change Is Behavior Change\nTo change your life you must change your actions.\nTo change your actions (in the right direction) you need a plan. There isn\u2019t any other way. And if you don\u2019t create your own, someone will create a plan for you.\nTo stick to the plan you need a system.\nSystems are organized behavior changes.\nTo create a system you must attack your goals, embrace the nature of trial and error, double down on your successes, and persist until \u201csuccess\u201d becomes the default state in each area of your life. Health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nBusiness: The New Digital Society\nEventually, everybody will be in the creator economy. \u2013 Naval Ravikant\nThe world is shifting from corporate dominance to individual power thanks to technology.\nThis is reflected in nature through the principle of division and unity.\nEverything divides and reunites, like ocean to cloud to rain, and the creator economy is the perfect example of this phenomenon.\nIn the Renaissance Era, the economy favored the multi-dimensional. The polymaths. The artists who refused to limit their abilities. The thinkers, creators, designers, builders, and individuals who took responsibility for their mental, physical, and spiritual development.\nIn the Digital Renaissance we are going through, history is repeating itself.\nWe can learn anything, do anything, and become anything thanks to the vast and rapid information expanding at our fingertips.\nThe expansion of the mental plane of existence (through the internet) has created a field of infinite potential.\nCommunication is no longer local.\nCommerce is no longer local.\nFriendships are no longer local.\nSociety is no longer fragmented.\nThe creator economy is virtual reality.\nYour personal brand is your character.\nOnline business is the game and progression.\nNetworking is how you build a powerful tribe.\nPurposeful products are how you make a living.\nThe intrinsic philosophy you cultivate throughout your journey is the marketing firepower that attracts those like you.\nYou are a part of the creator economy right now.\nThe question is \u2013 which side are you on?\nAre you engaging in the mutual benefit of value exchange? Product for money? Or are you draining your attention, overloading your mind, and wasting your creative ability by not producing anything in return for the value you are taking?\nBrand \u2013 You Are The Most Profitable Niche\nYour brand is your online avatar.\nStrong brands have vision. A big irrational goal that they are leading their followers toward. The gravity of that goal \u2013 and the energy displayed along with it \u2013 is what attracts people to you.\nYour brand is your highest version.\nIt is who you are becoming.\nIt is your guiding light toward a better future that allows you to align your actions with goals through a tangible vessel that others can benefit massively.\nYour job is to display who you are in your profile picture, images, bio, and website.\nYour style shapes your designs.\nYour vision shapes your bio.\nYour goals shape the content, product, and marketing you create under your brand as a hierarchy.\nContent \u2013 Lessons Learned Completing Quests\nYour content is the ideas, thoughts, beliefs, opinions, lessons, and advice you acquire as you pursue your challenging hierarchy of goals.\nDo you see the power in this?\nWriting has changed my life.\nIt has brought self-awareness, self-understanding, and the ability to organize my thoughts \u2013 or order consciousness \u2013 to make life more enjoyable. This is a driving factor why I created 2 Hour Writer \u2013 to teach you what is arguably the most valuable (and profitable) skill that will never go out of style \u2013 even with the emergence of AI.\nYou don\u2019t need fancy content frameworks and templates.\nThey help, of course, but the best content results from energy transfer.\nAs you acquire knowledge and skills through education and practice \u2013 share the ideas that spark excitement and resonance in you.\nDo not filter yourself.\nThis is what attracts a like-minded readership that sets you up for monetizing your life\u2019s work.\nProduct \u2013 Systems For Behavior Change\nThe best products spark positive behavior change.\nBehavior change is reflected in the eternal markets of business \u2013 health, wealth, and relationships.\nWrite to yourself.\nBuild for yourself.\nSell to yourself.\nCreate a product or service out of the knowledge and skills you\u2019ve acquired on your journey.\nSomething that you would have wanted, or something that would truly benefit your life right now.\nThere are individuals in the creator economy that sell courses, clothing, supplements, blue light glasses, planners, coaching in multiple areas of life, kitchenware, and really anything that shapes the lifestyle of people like you.\nPeople will object and tell you to \u201cstart a real business.\u201d\nWhat they mean is, \u201cI am fabricating problems that don\u2019t benefit humanity. Don\u2019t start a business around real problems that will raise the collective consciousness.\u201d\nPeople who have a poor relationship with money think that sales and business are evil.\nThey don\u2019t understand that the exchange of goods is a part of human nature.\nMoney is neutral until put in the hands of good or evil.\nConsistent progression toward your conscious goals ensures that you lean toward good.\nWhen you solve your own problems and sell the solution, you can guarantee that those problems exist on the cosmic scale, and rest well knowing that you are making a difference.\nMarketing \u2013 Cultivating An Intrinsic Philosophy\nIt is wise to study marketing and sales.\nThey are evergreen skills backed with psychological and metaphysical principles of value exchange.\nOf course, there are tainted aspects of those skills. People who lack moral development will use them for evil, but like money, these skills are neutral until wielded.\nInvest in education around these, but do so to note patterns and identify principles that shape your articulation and persuasive ability.\nFrom there, use the intrinsic philosophy you cultivate as you play the game.\nGoals imply problems and problems imply struggle.\nYou will struggle on this journey, but the lessons learned are what increase your level of mind.\nThe reasons or \u201cwhys\u201d behind your pursuit is how you promote the product you create to the people you\u2019ve attracted.\nWhy did you start training in the gym or fixing your health?\nWhy did you improve your relationships and social life?\nWhy did you increase your wealth through business, skill, and professional pursuits?\nThe \u201cwhy\u201d is what creates emotion in your readers.\nFrom there, you can learn tactics to test on your business to increase revenue, but don\u2019t lose your soul in the process.\nThat\u2019s it for this one my friends.\nLife is a game.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "heading": "The Cure To A Mediocre Life (Become Multidimensionally Jacked)",
        "content": "For some reason, I\u2019ve always had the drive to \u201cmax out\u201d every area of my life.\nI saw life as a video game.\nMy mind, body, spirit, and finances were the abilities I had to gain experience in.\nI wanted to become multidimensionally jacked.\nMaybe because I started questioning the default path early.\nMaybe because I noticed how unhappy, overweight, and miserable people seemed.\nMaybe because I observed how people limited their opportunities by taking a specific path in life.\nIt didn\u2019t make sense to follow what most people do, because that would create a life that most people have, and that isn\u2019t pretty.\nThe problem with the default path in life is specialization, compartmentalization, and niching down.\nWe are trained to focus on one dot, instead of the lines that connect the dots.\nIn school, we learn biology, chemistry, math, literature, and more. We go to individual classes that don\u2019t connect the dots between them all. It lacks holism, creativity, and the kind of practicality that gets abnormal results.\nAfter school, we narrow our minds further on what we think we want to be for the rest of our lives.\nWe\u2019re expected, as teenagers, to choose one of the infinite paths in life when we haven\u2019t even started our real life. How can we know exactly what we want? There doesn\u2019t seem to be a greater recipe for misery than to focus on one thing for the rest of your life.\nThis strips our curiosity and creativity from us.\nIt leads to a world where warriors lack brains and intellectuals lack balls.\nA \u201cphilosopher\u201d will ignore practical aspects of life because they are an intellectual. But the main question of philosophy is \u201cHow does one live a good life?\u201d If a philosopher can\u2019t build a business, ease their mind, or become a social savant, their philosophy means nothing.\nScientists will throw a frog in a blender to examine its parts. They will make a few discoveries, but not nearly as many if they studied holistically.\nRather than only looking at the pieces of a frog, you can study its environment, mating patterns, decision-making, and diet without ignoring one or the other.\nThe effects of compartmentalized learning destroy our individual potential.\nThe Modern Renaissance Man\nAt birth, we are prescribed a way of life.\nGo to school, get a job, find a partner, try to squeeze in activities that make life good, retire at 65, and never work again when work is a necessary part of life that should involve investing our attention in what we deem enjoyable.\nIn school, we\u2019re told to pick a major.\nIn business, we\u2019re told to pick a niche.\nSo we neglect other areas of study and our results suffer.\nCreativity is the path to wealth, mental and financial, and creativity requires a high level of understanding focused on solving specific problems.\nWe are smack in the middle of a second Golden Age.\nThere is so much information on the internet that it becomes overwhelming. There is no way that you can learn everything, but you can learn a lot.\nPeople still live in a paradigm where they have to get very good at one thing, because in the past, that\u2019s what the environment required for success.\nNow, success is reserved for the value creator. The specialized generalist. The new Renaissance man. The Digital Renaissance Man. Somebody who can study diverse interests, create value from them, and sustain an enjoyable lifestyle like I teach in Digital Economics.\nWe live in interesting times.\nThere\u2019s an abundance of information, but it\u2019s only overwhelming to those without goals or intentions behind their learning.\nThe creator economy emerged and courses began condensing the information into actionable business models and life advice.\nContent, courses, and books are like mental zip files for the modern world.\nIt no longer takes 4-12 years, $40,000, and a piece of paper to make a replaceable income.\nBut, this implies personal responsibility.\nNobody is there to hold your hand.\nHere\u2019s what you do:\n1) I Am Nobody\nBecome labelless.\nBecome everything.\nBe a designer, writer, marketer, socializer, runner, bodybuilder, philosopher, scientist, psychologist, and polymath that knows how to sustain their obsessive curiosity.\nSubscribing to one skill, ideology, or identity limits your potential in every situation.\nThe Universe is a shapeshifter. It is in constant flow. The oceans evaporate, condense in the clouds, rain down into puddles, and the water inevitably finds its way back.\nNothing is permanent.\nYour cells are completely different from a few years ago. Your interests are allowed to change. Your mind is allowed to change. You are allowed to change.\nBecome the Universe.\n2) The Curiosity Compass\nAs a kid, people would discourage \u201cgoing through a phase.\u201d\nI had my emo phase, my gym bro phase, and even my raver phase. All of which have shaped who I am.\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with experimentation. There is absolutely something wrong with conforming to the whims of others.\nPrescriptions, roadmaps, and long curriculums are not bad, but they narrow your mind on a specific outcome with specific advice to reach that goal.\nThis is useful, but should not be treated as a one-and-done type of deal. That\u2019s how you get trapped in a miserable life.\nThere is one pattern I\u2019ve noticed both in myself and those I aspire to be like:\nThey don\u2019t limit what they learn to one thing.\nEverything connects.\nBy pursuing what you are curious about, not only are you motivated to learn, but pattern recognition increases good dopamine and solidifies high-level knowledge.\n\u201cFocus on one thing\u201d is great advice, but only if that one thing is a big, meaty, meaningful goal that requires you to focus on a plethora of interests, skills, and experiences to achieve.\nMy \u201cshiny object syndrome\u201d in business is what led to my online persona today. My branding, content, and products are all a unique culmination of my skills and interests.\nIt is wise to become obsessively curious about a topic, skill, or interest for 1-2 months to add it to your mental toolbox. This will only increase your awareness of opportunities as you experience life.\nWhen you niche down (for too long, or too far) you become a glorified search engine that lacks depth and personality.\nIf you want to share your curiosities in public (in a way that brings career opportunities and fulfillment) check out 2 Hour Writer.\n3) Invest In Your Education\nIn this life, you own one thing: your mind.\nEverything else can be taken away from you.\nThere is one thing that the school system did get right which is consistent, daily education in hopes for a better future.\nBut, schools don\u2019t prioritize curiosity, so most people hate learning by the time they graduate.\nLearning is the foundation of the human experience.\nHammer it into your head that you must be learning something, anything, every single day. No matter if it\u2019s for 10 minutes or 3 hours, your future depends on it.\nHow else are you going to discover new opportunities if you don\u2019t first learn about them? How are you going to act on opportunities that don\u2019t exist to you?\nWhen you stop learning, your life stops progressing. You stop growing. The psychological benefits and feel-good chemicals stop flowing. Life gets mediocre and repetitive. You become mechanical and robotic.\nWe\u2019ve talked about learning a lot, but learning means nothing without building.\nBecome A Builder\nIn my new book The Art Of Focus (coming soon) I have a section on the philosophy of the builder.\nOne pattern I\u2019ve noticed in my life is that I\u2019ve always carved out time to build something of my own.\nSchool work, client work, and projects assigned to me at a job were necessary but didn\u2019t get me the fulfillment I was looking for.\nMy life was the meta-project that was built through a series of personal and business projects.\nProjects frame your attention for learning.\nWhen your focus is centered on that which you are building, all information you are exposed to is filtered through that lens.\nThe source of learning is struggle not memorization. You must encounter a problem, discover the solution to that problem, and integrate it into your life.\nTo identify a problem, you need a goal.\nTo solve a problem, you need to create a solution.\nTo create a solution, you need a project to invest your attention in for the next 1-6 months.\nWhen I say project, I mean something that is measurable and documented. It doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product.\nIt can be as simple as having a weight training log, tracking your food, tracking your weight, and researching fitness information to boost your progress.\nLet\u2019s start there.\n1) Big Irrational Goals, Small Rational Steps\nBig goals are better than small goals because they give you the vision, motivation, and long-term focus necessary to see them through.\nI get more excited about building a million-dollar business in 1 year than I do sending 10 networking DMs a day.\nI get more excited over looking shredded at the beach this summer than I do meal prepping for the week.\nTo embark on your journey of becoming multidimensionally jacked, create a big goal for the main pillars of your life.\nMind \u2013 How do you want to handle emotions and stress? Do you want to have the same mediocre mindset as everyone else?\nBody \u2013 How do you want to look and feel? How does that impact other areas of your life (like how others perceive you and throw opportunities at you)?\nSpirit \u2013 Do you feel like life lacks meaning, wonder, and fulfillment? Do you feel like life is happening to you, or that you are flowing with life?\nBusiness \u2013 How much money do you want to make? Why? Do you want that money to come from a purposeful endeavor, unlike 90% of jobs?\nI would highly encourage that you spend 10-20 minutes writing about this in a journal. How do those impact your life?\nThe problem is that people stop here.\nThey mentally masturbate over their goals and never make any meaningful progress toward them.\n2) Outline A Project For Each Domain Of Life\nThe goal is the what, the vision is the why, and the project is the how.\nNow that we have vision and motivation for our big goals, we need to gain clarity.\nProjects have a goal, process, and priority actions to knock out on a daily basis.\nWhat can you do every single day that will move the needle toward your goals?\nWhat aspects of your goals do you need to educate yourself on to make better decisions?\nHow can you document your progress in a way that keeps you motivated to come back tomorrow?\nIn the notebook you used to write down your goals, create a simple project for each goal:\nThe milestones \u2013 Write down tangible milestones with realistic timelines.\nThe variables \u2013 Write out each variable that will help you achieve the goal (for health: nutrition, training, sleep. for business: product, traffic generation, content)\nThe principles \u2013 The priority actions that will move the needle forward.\nThe skills \u2013 The skills you will have to acquire to actualize that goal.\nThis brings even more clarity to changing your life.\n3) Start, Then Learn\nIf you want to learn faster, don\u2019t start learning.\nOutline a project\nStart building it out\nLearn along the way\nToo many people get trapped in tutorial hell, stacking up useless knowledge as brain fog.\nStart, encounter a problem, and experiment with different techniques to solve that problem.\nWhen I was learning Photoshop, I would try to learn everything about the software before starting.\nWhen I did start, I felt like I knew absolutely nothing.\nI had to supplement with specific tutorials and \u201ccreate with me\u201d videos until I figured out how to create what I wanted.\nWhat I realized is that there is more than 1 way to solve a problem.\nIf I wanted to remove the background behind something as complex as a tree, I could either do it with the pen tool, color channels, color range, or quick select.\nQuick select would be what everyone does, and it often leads to the worst results.\nKeep this in mind when you are researching anything.\nIf anyone can solve the problem with easily accessible information, there is probably a better way of doing it that will give you an edge over your competition.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to make it seem like you should never learn unless you have a problem.\nQuite the opposite.\nI would highly encourage a general education habit.\n10-30 minutes every single day immersing yourself in information related to your goals.\nWatch a YouTube video that interests you. Buy a best-selling book. Queue a podcast for your next walk (and start going on walks\u2026 I promise you won\u2019t keep up with this education habit if you don\u2019t get out of your house. Too many distractions).\n4) Lifestyle Design Through Habit Formation\nThe difference between you and who you want to become is the habits that compose your lifestyle.\nThink about it.\nDo mentally, physically, or financially jacked people just wake up with the best mind, body, and business one day?\nOr do they have tiny actions they take on a daily basis that maintains their progress and builds toward a better future?\nMost people will tell you to stop playing video games, going out, and distracting yourself\u2026 I agree, but I don\u2019t.\nI still play video games here and there. Maybe 5 hours a week.\nI still go out with friends and stay up late. Maybe 2-5 times a month.\nThe reason I still outpace 99% of people is that I frontload my mornings with needle-moving tasks.\nBetween 5am and 11am I:\nGo on a run 3-4 days a week\nWrite my newsletter and content for 1 hour (this sustains 95% of my business\u2026 remember, principles).\nBuild out a new project, right now it\u2019s my book launch and software company\nHit the gym 6-7 days a week\nTake walks in between all of those activities\nCook nutrient-dense meals that take 10-15 minutes to prepare (and eat out for dinner quite a bit \u2013 I\u2019m hovering around 4500 calories a day)\nI know not everyone can do this due to time constraints, but neither could I in the past.\nAs you get results from your efforts, you become more efficient at what you do. Time will free up (since that should be a sub-goal for almost every goal you set\u2026 it\u2019s a great way of measuring progress).\nWhen in doubt:\nWaking up an hour earlier unlocks the distraction-free time that will solve most of your problems.\nThat\u2019s it for this one my friends.\nTo the multidimensionally jacked,\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

It is a literal waste of time to even ask the question.\n\u201cHow do I start a business?\u201d\nAh, yes, let me write 4 books, my entire life journey, and redo the 100 YouTube videos I made just for you so that you don\u2019t have to do any of the work.\nWrite your own book.\nLive your own life.\nStop sitting around doing things that don\u2019t result in experience boosts.\nYou will never get a truly actionable answer by outsourcing your entire learning journey out of fear of that journey.\nThe problem is a lack of understanding.\nPeople don\u2019t understand how to learn.\nThey\u2019ve never sat down and contemplated what the learning process looks like.\nAnd most haven\u2019t even asked for advice on how to learn (my point: people are asking the wrong questions from the get-go).\nWhen they approach a new goal, they don\u2019t have the learning process framing their decisions:\nHave a conscious meaningful goal\nStart forming the habits that allow that goal to be achieved\nManage the pain and emotions that come with identity change\nProgram your mind with information relevant to that goal\nExperiment with different techniques\nSeek technical advice when you encounter problems along the way\nAnd when you get to that last part\u2026 advice is only as good as it is specific to your situation.\nBooks, podcasts, articles, and social media content have great advice, but only .001% of it applies to the exact situation you are in. The millions of bits of information you can perceive at this very moment of your life will be vastly different in the next second (and completely different from anyone else\u2019s experience and interpretation of that experience).\nOnly once you are in a state of pain, struggle, or challenge can you receive the insight necessary to transcend to the next level.\nThere is a process to receiving the best advice.\nThat way you don\u2019t get mentally overweight with useless knowledge.\nLet\u2019s break down identity change, self-experimentation, and how to ask for advice so you can supercharge your learning:\nYou Don\u2019t Need More Advice, You Need To Change Who You Are\nThe reason you haven\u2019t achieved a goal is that you aren\u2019t the person that would have achieved the goal.\nEvery new goal you set is like throwing an anchor into the unknown.\nEvery new goal you set demands a new worldview, specific skills, and beliefs that form who you are.\nLike a video game.\nThere\u2019s a reason you aren\u2019t level 100.\nYou lack the character development that turns you into a level 100.\nIn video games, risk isn\u2019t real.\nIn real life, risks are real but often inflated with thought.\nAll change requires a change in identity.\nYou can\u2019t just take advice and expect it to give you the experience required to reach the level of goal you\u2019ve set for yourself.\nWhen was the last time you actually took the advice you asked for?\nOut of all of the advice you\u2019ve gotten, how much did you actually listen to?\nMost advice you get isn\u2019t applicable to your current level of goals and understanding.\nA level 100 is going to tell you something that makes sense to them, but not to a level 10.\nPeople don\u2019t realize that the difference in experience is exponential.\nIn a game, each higher level requires more experience.\nGetting from level 10 to 11 may require 300 experience points.\nGetting from level 99 to 100 would require 100x that amount.\nAs a beginner, you don\u2019t have to change too much. You change a few habits, set aside an hour a day, and you can replace your income within a year (ish).\nAfter that, the real self-development journey begins. Progress slows down, like the \u201cnoobie gains\u201d phenomenon in the gym. You gain strength and muscle rapidly for the first year, then it becomes a slow and painful grind.\nIf your identity is not patient, focused on the long term, risk-tolerant, and a lover of failure, you will lose.\n1) Programming Your Worldview\nYour worldview influences the openness of your perspective.\nThe openness of your perspective influences your perception of situations.\nYour perception of situations influences the decisions you make.\nThe decisions you make influence how you act.\nYour actions form an information feedback loop that programs your identity or sense of self.\nYour identity shapes your worldview and your worldview shapes your identity.\nHow do you begin to change who you are?\nBy treating self-education and skill acquisition as a necessary part of your everyday life.\nIt baffles me that very few people do this.\nThey want to become a better person.\nThey want to achieve great things.\nThey want to be at peace.\nBut they don\u2019t realize that their ability to maneuver toward these desirable outcomes comes from having the skill to do so.\nSkill is where the mind meets life.\nSkill is cultivated through education and practice.\nThe difference between where you are and what you want is skill. Not belief. Not knowledge. Not environment. Not socioeconomic status. Not your upbringing. All of those are variables, powerful ones, that are trumped by skill.\nIt all starts with programming your mind with the right inputs.\nSwap mindless scrolling for intentional learning.\nSwap video games for building new projects (same thing, but in the real world).\nSwap sleeping in for a morning walk and a book, podcast, or video that will open up new possibilities in your life.\nLearning leads to awareness of opportunity. Awareness of opportunity creates motivation. Continuous learning (every single day) changes your decision-making with time.\n2) The Pain Of Identity Change\nChanging who you are is like sculpting a work of art.\nBy the time you turn 18, you are like a giant, square, slab of marble that looks, feels, and acts ugly.\nThe first decision is the most painful.\nA commitment to change.\nTo *pop* an arm out of the marble against its will so you can start sculpting away.\nBe careful now.\nIf you strike too hard, you may destroy the entire slab.\nYou must make small, precise taps to sculpt your ideal mental physique.\nEvery situation presents a small tap that can be made.\nYou must approach situations consciously.\nWhen you feel that spike of anxiety, pause and push through.\nThe pain is temporary.\nAll growth requires pain.\n3) Pain Is Pleasure, Death Gives Life\nI was listening to an old Roof Talk video from Frank Yang this week.\nWhen I was a teen, I would listen to these and have no idea what he was saying (I just wanted to be weird and wise with esoteric knowledge to look cool in front of my friends).\nHe made an interesting point about death.\nWhat if death is the ultimate truth?\nTo become one with what is.\nTo dissolve all mental limitations and barriers between self and Source.\nWe have two drives (as said by Freud):\nSex drive \u2013 creation, survival, and extending our lives in the matrix\nDeath drive \u2013 destruction, absolute, and returning to Infinity\nI will be talking about these in the next letter (why you can\u2019t escape the Matrix), but Frank\u2019s point was this.\nWe enjoy pain, but many people hide from that and inflict more, unbearable pain with surface-level pleasurable activities that keep you \u201ccomfortable.\u201d\nSome seek it out at the gym, in business, and through personal development. They shed layers of their ego to get as close as possible to a mental death they can \u2013 that\u2019s the goal of the monks, mystics, and self-improvers.\nThe lesson is to create an environment (like the gym) to generate suffering that leads to new life.\nI do not think absolute ego death is the answer, so I will not discuss that here.\nAnd please, understand that I am not talking about a physical or materialist paradigm type of death. I\u2019m talking mental. Symbolic.\nThe Power Of Self-Experimentation (How To Solve Your Problems For Good)\nSelf-experimentation is the only way to solve your problems for good.\nSelf-experimentation and self-reliance go hand in hand. They feed into each other.\nSelf-experimentation is how you avoid the dangerous nature of prescriptions and how-to advice.\nA hypothetical problem:\nNot having enough money to do what you enjoy with your time.\nPerson A:\nFollows exactly what a money guru says.\nThey start investing a few bucks here and there.\nThey play it safe with their stocks.\nThey downgrade their car so they don\u2019t have that monthly expense.\nPerson B:\nPulls advice from multiple sources to make decisions for themself.\nThey use how-to advice, but only to discover principles that can be integrated into the pursuit of their goals.\nThey study religiously, but do not attach to business, health, or social ideologies that keep them stagnant.\nEventually, with education and effort, it *clicks* and they know how to make it work.\nI recently saw a post on Instagram about how wealth generation is slow, which I agree with, but not THAT slow.\nThe post was about how every person that became a millionaire under 30 had either an inheritance, a high income, or a large income event (like crypto).\nThe person that shared the post mentioned how they\u2019ve had an inheritance, and have been budgeting, but are only halfway to one million in their mid-30s.\nI say this for perspective, at 26 I became a liquid millionaire (until I invested 50% of it into a new business) with a $3.5 million a year revenue one-person business.\nNobody could teach me to do this\u2026 because so few have done it before with the path I took. It wasn\u2019t even a possibility just a few years ago. Technology has made it possible, and very few have taken advantage of it.\nI can\u2019t teach the exact path, because it\u2019s highly individual.\nOf course, I can teach the principles, give you systems, and show a map of how I did it in things like 2 Hour Writer and Digital Economics \u2013 but even you will have to go through the education and effort of making it work for you.\nLet\u2019s walk through some tangible steps to achieving any goal you set your mind to:\n1) Have A Conscious Goal\nGoals provide a frame for your decision-making.\nI don\u2019t want to hear the regurgitated \u201csystems are greater than goals!\u201d advice you got from James Clear.\nYou can\u2019t have a system without a goal. Simple as that.\nYou need a goal that grows into a vision.\nOne that you keep top of mind so you can collect fuel to the motivation that goal gives you.\nYou don\u2019t just feel ultra-motivated out of nowhere.\nYou sit with a goal, experience life, and generate reasons to achieve that goal through study and observation.\nThe more energy you invest in a goal (education and effort) the stronger the gravity of that goal. It begins to pull you towards it effortlessly.\n2) Holistic Understanding\nBig picture is greater than technical details.\nPrinciples are greater than tactics.\nBut that does not eliminate the need for technical details and tactics (just like how systems don\u2019t remove the need for goals).\nYou will fail in business if you do not understand every moving piece of the business you are trying to build.\nYou will fail in fitness if you don\u2019t have a holistic understanding of your body, nutrition, and training.\nAnd, if you don\u2019t understand the vast negative impacts of the environment, modern foods, and stress \u2013 you will succumb to them.\nAwareness makes positive decision-making much, much easier.\nIf you don\u2019t have a big-picture understanding of what you wish to achieve, you become susceptible to ideologies that are by definition of an ideology untrue in a relative world.\nYou will fall for get-rich-quick schemes, fad diets, and strict advice just to start over from scratch when you realize they aren\u2019t sustainable.\nWhen you approach a goal, education and effort go hand in hand to create understanding.\nPurchase general books, listen to podcasts, and follow social media accounts that dish out various perspectives.\nPursue your goal with the time you have and implement what you learn. Action solidifies true knowledge.\nAdjust your decision-making as you learn. You will suck at first. That\u2019s the reality of any new endeavor.\n3) Experiment With Various Techniques\nAs you educate toward your goal, you will discover techniques to test.\nIn business, this looks like writing advice, lead generation advice, best business models, and anything else you can find with a quick Google search.\nThis is easily accessible information that anyone can (and will) pursue.\nIf it\u2019s easy to find, chances are you aren\u2019t going to be a special success case.\nI wish I could give concrete advice, but that would leave you with the same problem.\nAgain, self-reliance.\nYou must try the techniques you are given so you can learn the underlying principles through experience.\nAs you learn the truth, new opportunities (that others can\u2019t see) will make themselves known to you.\nI would have never considered being a creator if I didn\u2019t already have 7 failed businesses under my belt.\nI wouldn\u2019t see the immense benefits of it.\nI wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it work (because I didn\u2019t have an evergreen skill set).\nYou experiment with techniques to increase your skill stack.\nSkills compound and allow you to perceive and act on better opportunities.\n4) Systemize What Works\nAs you gain clarity on what you want to do, there will be \u201clevers\u201d that bring you the most results.\nCertain techniques will get you 1% better results than the next person. That is your edge. Because that 1% compounds.\nI can write for 30 minutes every single morning and repurpose that content for all platforms. This is what (with time) brought in multiple millions of followers and dollars.\nI saw writing as a lever for traffic.\nI saw a newsletter as an infinitely repurposable piece of content.\nIt took me a long time at first, but as my skill increased I was able to systemize the time down to 30 minutes each morning.\nThis won\u2019t look the same for a beginner.\nOn something like social media, you will have to:\nReply like a madman to get eyes on your account and content\nPractice writing content that gets shared (and brings in followers)\nBuild a product or service that solves your own problems\nStart to write longer form content to build trust and make sales\nYour systems will evolve and change.\nIf they don\u2019t, you leave growth on the table.\nI still know people with 100,000 followers (that are making 5-10x less than me) because they don\u2019t know how to evolve their systems.\nThey still waste 1-2 hours commenting every day instead of building the next aspect of their vision. This becomes a massive time suck as you grow (I don\u2019t want to hear any opinions from people with less than 50,000 followers, you don\u2019t have understanding or experience).\nThis letter wasn\u2019t the most actionable, but that\u2019s the point.\nFor every piece of actionable advice given there are 100,000 people that never see success with it.\nSo, stop masturbating to \u201call actionable advice and no fluff\u201d when you need the fluff for nuanced understanding.\nDon\u2019t be an advice junky.\nDo what you want and get better at doing it through education and effort.\nHave a great weekend.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "heading": "I HAD To Learn These High-Income Skills (If I Wanted To Make Money)",
        "content": "My business journey is simple.\nI tried almost everything and failed.\nBut, as we all know here, failure is a blessing.\nIt is a data point that reveals what can be improved.\nThose that don\u2019t fail don\u2019t succeed.\nIt just doesn\u2019t make sense when you think about it\u2026 to expect success without failure when success only exists from a reference point of failure.\nIf you were \u201csuccessful\u201d since the day you were born (which you were in many ways) would you see it as success? Or would you see it as normal life?\nYou must set a new goal as a high, embrace massive failure as a low, and dance through the struggle to marry the meaningful contrast.\nThis brings up an important point.\nSelf-reliance.\nRich kids aren\u2019t self-reliant because they didn\u2019t teach themselves to be. Success is their normal. So much so that they don\u2019t have new potentials to discover. Not all rich kids are depressed and socially inept, but many many are because they didn\u2019t have a reason to cultivate a skill set to achieve a self-generated goal.\nNobody can teach you self-reliance.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s not self-reliance.\nTo become self-reliant in any domain, from money to relationships to health, you need the skills that bridge the gap between where you are and what you want. Most people don\u2019t know what they want, and even more don\u2019t see where they are as a problem.\nNotice the word \u201cneed\u201d in the paragraph above.\nThere are skills you need to learn to achieve self-reliance.\nThey aren\u2019t optional.\nI repeat. They are not optional.\nThe rest of this letter is not a personal method.\nThe skills I present are what every single successful person has to learn (or hire for) to achieve a certain level of success in business, relationships, and arguably health \u2013 even though you may not see them as health skills yet.\nI failed at 7 business models.\nThe reason was that I didn\u2019t have an understanding of the skills that would actually make me money.\nAnd no, it\u2019s not any of the modern skills like web design, email marketing, or lead generation that people tell you to learn.\nWe need to peel back and go to the root of what makes those skills work.\nOnce you understand them, truly, through practice, then you will be able to make money flow like your sink does with water.\nThe Evergreen Skills\nI\u2019m in the middle of building a software business and I\u2019m lost.\nBusiness structure, trademark lawyers, general lawyers, hiring, design stages, operating agreements, etc.\nBut, these are all things I can learn on the fly.\nEvery other business (that isn\u2019t a one-person business) will need to learn the ropes of starting a \u201creal\u201d business at some point \u2013 so there are plenty of resources available online.\nWith a one-person business, you can set up a social media profile, create a digital product, and promote it for free (in most beginner cases).\nThe point is that the technical skills required to start a business are out there and available to learn.\nBut we aren\u2019t here to talk about those.\nBecause if those were the drivers of business success, most businesses wouldn\u2019t fail.\nMarketing and sales are different.\nThey are evergreen skills.\nThey require creativity, experience, and big picture understanding of your industry to make work.\nMarketing and sales are the differentiating factor between those that make money and those that don\u2019t.\nLet\u2019s take a tech startup for example.\nThey have incredible developers and an idea.\nThey build the software, launch, and\u2026 nothing.\nThey don\u2019t have an audience that trusts them. They don\u2019t have promotions that catch the attention of their target market. They don\u2019t solve a specific burning problem. They don\u2019t plan to raise problem awareness over time (they don\u2019t create their own customers through content). They don\u2019t have any of the firepower in place that would allow them to write good content, ads, and turn viewers into customers.\nMarketing and sales paired with writing and speaking is how you create value.\nI\u2019ve discussed value creation before as the single skill that built my one-person business. This letter will turn anything you do into a profitable endeavor.\nTo summarize the principles of marketing and sales that must be illustrated in your writing and speaking, you need:\nA desired outcome\nA burning problem that stands in the way\nA proven path to reach the outcome (unique to your experience)\nThe level of awareness of the person you are targeting (how aware are they of their problem?)\nAn angle to talk about that problem based on the 8 human desires\nA list of benefits and how solving the problem impacts their life\nProof (from yourself or previous customers) that you can solve that problem\nA big idea that catches attention in the sea of internet noise\nA risk reversal or guarantee that tips them over the edge\nMarketing and sales are evergreen because they are based on mechanics, human behavior, and psychology. They start in the mind as all things do.\nThese are all potent talking points in your content, landing pages, and anywhere else you communicate with people or customers.\nYou aren\u2019t only marketing a product or service.\nWhen you write content, you are selling your ideas.\nYour content doesn\u2019t get engagement or followers because you can\u2019t combine components from the above list into impactful writing and speaking.\nRemember how we discussed self-reliance?\nThe rest is on you.\nObsessively study marketing and sales, but keep the above points in mind so you can filter what is important.\nThe Evergreen Vessels\nMost people fail to make money because they don\u2019t understand how business works.\nYou need a good product (which has a host of skills involved in making) and you need people that want that product.\nLet\u2019s run through a scenario:\nI want to sell a planner.\nSo, I experiment on myself first.\nWhy? Because you need experience and results. Most businesses fail because they\u2019re trying to sell to people that have a problem they\u2019ve never experienced.\nI buy 4-5 best-selling planners on Amazon.\nI buy productivity books and courses.\nI drown myself in podcasts, social media accounts, and videos on productivity hacks.\nI structure my days, map out my work, and put what I\u2019ve learned to work.\nBy this point, I have an idea of how to improve the planner I want to sell \u2013 or do something entirely new based on what I discovered with my research.\nI\u2019ve also exposed myself to the entirety of what makes that business work.\nI\u2019ve listened to high-performing social media content (that I can recreate to promote my planner and build a following without ads).\nI\u2019ve purchased the planner, books, and courses from people that are making a living from them (so I can reverse engineer their marketing and web pages).\nI\u2019ve gotten results so that I have direct experience of the problem, desired outcome, and system to get there (which composes my marketing strategy).\nIt\u2019s all right in front of you but you aren\u2019t paying attention.\nIf you want to make money outside of your job, you need distribution and a product.\nIf you want to do it as one person without the restriction of physical location, you need code and content.\nCode is the back end of the internet.\nContent is the front end of the internet.\nCode is how you host content.\nContent is how you capture attention.\nYou don\u2019t need to learn how to code, because technology has advanced to the point we are at now.\nWhat used to take 10 employees to build a membership site can now be done by 1 person who purchases software.\nYou can hit \u201cpost,\u201d have one big account see that post, share it, and get hundreds of thousands of views without ever posting before.\nYou can build a readership that allows you to do anything you want with your life. You aren\u2019t bound to one static niche.\nAll-in-all I am saying that creating content is not optional anymore.\nIt was a few years ago, but markets evolve.\nSales cycles are getting longer.\n\nProspects are investigating you more.\n\nWhoever has the most & best content will win.\n\u2014 Cold Email Wizard \ud83d\udce9 (@blackhatwizardd) July 31, 2023\nContent is how you distribute your product.\nMarketing and sales are how you create products and content that are actually valued by the market.\nThose are the main skills you need to prioritize no matter what else you learn.\nMarketing, sales, writing, and speaking with content as your vessel for all of the above.\nIf \u201ccontent\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense to you, buy a few social media courses. Or check out 2 Hour Writer.\nThe Modern Career Path\nI have faith in the creator economy even when most don\u2019t see it.\nI see it as nature\u2019s way of correcting what went wrong in the Industrial Revolution.\nSchooling is decentralized with content and courses.\nStudents can pursue their curiosity and adapt to the times fast.\n8-hour workdays and wage slavery come to an end for individuals that self-educate and acquire skills to work for other creators and eventually themselves.\nHere is the career path I predict for the present and future:\n1) Code & Content\nCode and media are permissionless leverage. They\u2019re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. \u2013 Naval\nMost people will have to start with either code or content.\nSo, you either become a programmer or a content marketer.\nYou can learn both, but with time, of course. (This is one of the most potent skill stacks).\nThe programmer can work for creators, startups, and really any modern job. They can freelance or be employed by all of the above.\nThe content marketer can do the exact same. Everyone has a content, marketing, sales, or any form of media team.\nMost people should write content to build their public resume (or personal brand).\nThat is where you will find clients, jobs, and attract customers in the future.\nYour personal brand is your online character.\nIf you choose to not learn to code, that\u2019s perfectly fine, because modern software makes it so you don\u2019t have to.\n2) Marketing & Sales\nLearn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable. \u2013 Naval\nBoth paths will converge into the necessity of learning marketing and sales.\nMost software companies and coders fail because they can build a product, but they can\u2019t sell it.\nThe same goes for content creators.\nThey can build an audience with good writing, but when it comes to creating a product that people actually want, they fall short.\nIf you want to survive outside of a job that inevitably loses its shine and chains you to a paycheck, marketing and sales are your weapons on the entrepreneurial hunt.\n3) Build Distribution\nBuild distribution, then build whatever you want. \u2013 Jack Butcher\nDistribution is the most important concept you can understand in the digital race to riches.\nDistribution methods vary in leverage.\nFreelancers, agencies, local businesses, and even startups often focus on low-leverage, instantly gratifying distribution methods:\nCold email\nPaid ads\nDirect messages\nNow, these are still viable methods to acquire customers, but you are often left with nothing if you stop putting effort into them.\nYou are better off building long-term distribution (while mixing in the other methods to see profit quickly):\nBuilding an audience \u2013 like a 100,000 follower X audience.\nPromoting to your network \u2013 like having your 100,000 follower internet friend promote your work.\nRenting other\u2019s audiences \u2013 like newsletter or youtube sponsorships to get in front of millions of interested people.\nYou must learn social media as a skill to tap into the global distribution channel.\nAs you write content and build an audience, you can still email, message, or pay for ads to start earning immediately.\nFor perspective, I get around 12 million impressions per month on X alone. With other platforms, it\u2019s probably quadruple that number.\nFrom a Google search (I don\u2019t know how accurate this is), a low CPM is around $3 for paid ads (1000 impressions).\nEvery month on X (formerly Twitter) alone, I get what would cost me $36,000 a month worth of impressions.\nIf your content/ads are profitable \u2013 you should be able to make well over $100,000 from that each month.\n4) Employable To Unemployable\nThere comes a point where you know you will never be employed again.\nYour skills compound into knowing how to make money in any market condition.\nThe progression I would follow is this:\nStart learning the skills that all brands need \u2013 marketing, sales, branding, content, design, etc.\nApply for jobs or work for a creator to get real-world experience (and earn some money). This can be freelance or employment.\nDedicate 1 hour minimum each day to building your own thing. Write content, iterate until you are growing, and promote your offer.\nAs your audience grows, start to transition into doing your own thing. Expand your product stack to target more people in your audience.\nThis way, you are making it near impossible to not secure your future.\nIf you have subpar marketing skills, a massive audience can make up for that.\nIf you have subpar audience-building skills, marketing and sales knowledge can make up for that.\nA diversified skill stack backed by daily effort will solve most of your problems.\n5) Iterative Products\nMost creators fail because they treat monetization as a one-and-done type of deal.\nYour products and services evolve as you do. They build off of each other. You can\u2019t create a better product if you never launch the first.\nStagnation = death.\nMy web design service evolved into funnels. My funnel knowledge evolved into 3 digital products. Those digital products evolved into a community. My experience along the way created 2 more digital products. My 10+ lead magnets evolved into a planner, which is now being relaunched with my book in late September. All of the above are evolving into the software I\u2019m building. It never ends. That\u2019s what makes sit meaningful.\nIt should be obvious that if something isn\u2019t selling, it\u2019s a problem with you, not the market.\nIf you kept learning and refining your skill set, you would see the opportunity for improvement in your products.\nAll of this business stuff is just persistence and iteration for life.\nKeep building.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "You stop caring about others\u2019 opinions when you trust yourself with your future.\nThat\u2026 is a lot to unpack.\nLack of confidence is the one thing that plagues the potential of the majority of the population. They care too much about what others think.\nLet\u2019s say you want to start a business and the thoughts start to flood in:\nWhat will my parents think?\nWhat will my friends think?\nWhat will my spouse think?\nWill it be enough to replace my income?\nHow long will it take?\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the thoughts that come when you actually start building the business.\nThe reason people fail is they can\u2019t lift the emotional weights required to achieve the goals they set.\nFor every thought of a better life, there are 100 thoughts beating you back down.\nAnd that\u2019s just thoughts about business.\nWhat about the other 60-80,000 thoughts we have in a day?\nWe have a lot on our plate.\nWill I come off as weird when I try to make new friends?\nWhere will I end up in life if I don\u2019t get my debt under control?\nDid I feed the dog this morning? Imagine how terrible of a pet owner people would think I am if they found out.\nDeveloping self-confidence is no easy task.\nMore information, more responsibilities, and more options for our future turns confidence into success and anxiety into failure.\nThis is the modern environment we live in.\nHow do we begin to cultivate the trust in ourselves that leads to self-confidence?\nThe 4 Pillars Of Self-Confidence\nWhen most people wonder how they can become more confident, they are reminded of the simplistic advice:\n\u201cConfidence = competence.\u201d\nThis is true, but most people will see competence as getting better at a specific skill.\nSo they\u2019ll learn and learn and learn, never act, never self-reflect, and never actually develop confidence as a skill in any situation. This is the most common outcome.\nThere is depth behind that simple statement that few can see.\nWe must seek to understand that statement, because clearly \u201cconfidence = competence\u201d as general advice has not fixed one of the biggest problems in the world, but has made it worse.\nPillar 1) Perspective\nWhen you enter a situation where you don\u2019t feel confident, anxiety shoots through the roof.\nThis closes your mind to everything but your thoughts.\nThey multiply.\nYou completely retract from the situation and become a slave to your past. The experiences you\u2019ve had before. You remain the same person.\nYou must snap out of this and make a conscious effort to reprogram your habitual way of reacting to situations.\nTo do this:\nWhen you enter a situation and anxiety sparks, pause\nZoom out to see the situation for what it is, just a normal situation\nTransfer consciousness to those in the situation with you\n\u201cTransferring consciousness\u201d is adopting another person\u2019s perspective.\nMost people are just people living the same experience as us.\nBillionaires are people with the same problems.\nFitness models are people with the same problems.\nAny person you mentally place above you has the same problems.\nThe ONE thing that will make them react in a negative way to you is treating them like they aren\u2019t human.\nDon\u2019t put them above you.\nRemember, this is a habit you are forming.\nIt will take repetition and practice.\nYou cannot advance to the other pillars if you do not gain perspective on a situation.\nPillar 2) Perception\nHow you perceive situations determines how you act.\nThis requires you to shift into an open-minded state before and maintain it during, the situation.\nIf you are scrolling social media and don\u2019t perceive a business owner\u2019s tweet as an opportunity to reach out, you won\u2019t reach out.\nIf you do see it as an opportunity, you still may botch the message or not send one at all because you misperceive that individual.\nThe same goes for making new friends or engaging in difficult discussions.\nPerception goes two ways.\nYou perceive others in a certain way based on how they present themselves.\nThey perceive you based on how you present yourself.\nIf you don\u2019t \u201clook the part\u201d or hold yourself in a way that would lead to a positive interpretation by the other party, it won\u2019t go well. And you will know this subconsciously. You won\u2019t engage in situations because you set yourself up for failure in the way you look and act.\nI\u2019m as introverted as they come, but people often tell me I look confident in the way I dress, walk, and talk.\nPractice.\nPillar 3) Practice\nHow good you are at something allows you to perceive situations better.\nThink of skill acquisition as a way to increase your level in the game of life.\nIn a video game there are \u201cskill trees.\u201d\nAs you play the game, you choose skills to help you play how you want.\nAs you practice those skills, you increase your experience, and new skills become available to you.\nThe key point here:\nYou are not able to access other skills until you practice the ones available to you.\nYou don\u2019t have the awareness of profitable opportunities because you don\u2019t have the skill to recognize, choose, and act on them.\nAs you move toward your goals, it will require that you educate and practice skills to reach those goals.\nIf you aim too high, you get overwhelmed and don\u2019t know what to learn.\nYou must play at your level and acquire the skills necessary to reach the next level.\nAs your level increases, you fill your toolbelt with skills that allow you to view the plane you are on, which is more vast than the lower level you were at.\nMy first successful endeavor was freelance web design.\nA single skill that is available for anyone to learn. Lots of competition and battling for higher prices.\nI knew that if I wanted to do something more profitable, like funnels for service businesses, I would have to learn skills like marketing, copywriting, and buyer\u2019s journey to do that well.\nThen, when I pursued the level of a creator, I needed to combine what I knew and add new skills like content writing (I teach all skills you need in 2 Hour Writer).\nThe higher my level grew, the more people I met, and the more my confidence throughout multiple domains increased.\nThe worst thing you can do is stop learning new skills and settle for the level you are at.\nPillar 4) Authenticity\nAuthenticity is doing what you want without interference from external thoughts, opinions, and beliefs that you feel the need to conform to.\nWhen I curse, and people in the comments tell me that\u2019s unprofessional, do I conform to their relative beliefs (that aren\u2019t absolute truth) or do I think for myself?\nI don\u2019t care to be professional. I don\u2019t care to be offended by words that every single person interprets in a different way.\nConfidence through authenticity is a mental game.\nYou must play it daily.\nYou must pause, gain perspective, perceive the situation, and practice the skill that the situation requires.\nAuthenticity is how you implement the 4 Pillars of Self-Confidence.\nThe Unconventional Path To Self-Confidence\nEntrepreneurship is in your nature.\nTo pursue new challenges, never settle, expand your perspective through skill acquisition, and get feedback on if you are actually contributing to society in the form of money.\nEntrepreneurship is creation.\nAnd being a creator is the act of channeling the divine through your human edge.\nYou don\u2019t want to get stuck in a situation where challenge ceases to exist.\nLike a monkey in a cubicle, your psyche will suffer, and you will wonder why your life isn\u2019t fulfilling even if you are a top 1% earner.\nPersonal growth is a gateway drug into business growth.\nAnd business growth is the unconventional path to self-confidence.\nI combine the two in Digital Economics so you can improve yourself, productize yourself, and earn from being yourself. A natural progression.\n1) It demands that you evolve, or die.\nMost people die at 25.\nThey get their job.\nThey get their spouse.\nThey get their house.\nThey get their car.\nThey get exactly what society wants for them. Someone who is comfortable, docile, and of little threat to their system they are trying to survive.\nLife is ever-flowing, ever-evolving, and if you choose to obstruct that flow by settling for a sub-par life, you\u2019re dead.\nDeath is symbolic. And all understanding is metaphorical.\nIf life is growth, and growth requires new, death is the death of new ideas, potentials, projects, and practices.\nIf you want to survive in a world that never stops changing, entrepreneurship ensures that you don\u2019t. If you persist until success, that is.\n2) It demands you to become an expert in your industry.\nIf you have subpar understanding you will get subpar results.\nUnderstanding is different from knowledge.\nUnderstanding is the upward motion of expanding consciousness.\nMeditation is the downward motion of expanding consciousness.\nMost mystics and spiritual teachers forget this balance.\nIt\u2019s not creativity or productivity.\nIt\u2019s not monk or warrior.\nIt\u2019s not peace or progress.\nIt\u2019s not being or doing.\nIt\u2019s both.\nIt\u2019s life.\nThe duality collapses into one.\nIf you stack theory without practice, you will fail in this business.\nYou need both daily education and execution. Not one or the other.\n3) It demands you get results for yourself and your customers.\nIf you don\u2019t get results, you aren\u2019t valuable.\nSimple as that.\nIf you aren\u2019t getting results, that isn\u2019t a sign to quit. It\u2019s a sign to improve. True value requires development over time.\nEntrepreneurship is how you ensure that you develop yourself into a valuable asset in reality.\n4) It demands that you suck at what you\u2019re doing so you can improve.\nIt is foolish to think that you will not suck at almost everything at the start.\nThis is what keeps most people from acting on their dreams.\nOnce you overcome the first hump, you snowball into a season of pure progress.\n5) It demands that you change your work, rest, and play habits.\nYou cannot reach level 3 with the character that got you to level 2.\nGrowth requires change and that\u2019s why most people settle early.\n6) It demands a skill set in psychology so you understand your mind.\nMarketing, sales, writing, and speaking are the backbone of business success.\nIn today\u2019s world, wealth is generated through code and content.\nCode is the back end of the internet.\nContent is the front end.\nCombine both and you have people and product.\nSend people to product and you have profit.\nYou can learn to code, which is incredibly valuable, but unless that is a passion of yours you are better off learning content.\nYou can build using what the coders build (like website builders, social media platforms, and everything else on the internet) to distribute your content.\nContent requires self-understanding.\nYou must capture attention, hold attention, and deliver value to that attention.\nI discuss this in The $1 Million Dollar Skill Stack.\nA Potential Progression For Self-Improvers\nThe anxiety trap is dangerous when you attempt to become more confident.\nYou get anxious approaching new people.\nYou get anxious about the change required to build a business.\nWhen you feel it, pause.\n(No, seriously, this is going to take a conscious effort\u2026 pause.)\nZoom out.\nReframe your mind.\nThe cure to anxiety is curiosity.\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the reframe.\nWhen you\u2019re anxious about starting a business, you are projecting so far into the future that clarity is impossible. Your mind cannot bring order to the chaotic situation you mentally reside in.\nBring your attention back to what you can do right now.\nGet curious about what you can start learning, then learn it.\nWhen you are in a social situation, stop imagining every little detail about the future with that person.\nFocus your attention on them, right in front of you.\nWhat is something that catches your eye?\nAsk them about it.\nHere\u2019s how you can leverage curiosity to build momentum into a profitable business (with self-confidence as a byproduct).\n1) Start With Writing\nWhen you aren\u2019t confident, writing is your best bet.\nAnd, it\u2019s the foundation of any and all content.\nTweets, ads, videos, reels, etc all start with writing the actual post or a script.\nWriting allows you to flex your intelligence while everyone else competes for looks.\nYou don\u2019t have to show your body, or even your face for that matter. (Orange Book is one of my favorite anonymous writers.)\nTo become a good writer, you will need to understand psychology to structure a message that captures, holds, and spreads attention.\nTo understand psychology, study marketing and sales. That\u2019s how you learn to apply your psychological understanding in the real world.\nIf I were to give you a path, here\u2019s how to start writing:\nChoose a topic you are interested in making your full-time gig\nBlock out 30 minutes to learn about marketing, sales, or your interest\nDo not skip a day of learning. Watch videos, podcasts, read books and internet content.\nTake notes on the ideas that stick out to you.\nStart on Twitter (X) or Threads and start posting your ideas.\nStudy social media as a skill so you can grow (I teach all of this in 2 Hour Writer).\nIn the course of 3-6 months, you should gain a decent amount of followers.\nEnough to give you confidence that you can make this your full-time business.\nOnce you have enough readers, you can create a product or service to monetize your writing.\nThe marketing and sales knowledge will compound at this moment.\n2) Branch Into Speaking\nMost people don\u2019t know this, but the first platform I branched out to was not Instagram. It was a podcast.\nWhy?\nIt helped me meet high-level people and get offered more opportunities.\nYou don\u2019t need video editing skills. It is an easy progression from writing.\nIt forces you to identify your blind spots in communicating with other people.\nI didn\u2019t use a podcast to monetize or become famous.\nThat is incredibly rare with podcasting.\nI used it to get people I wanted to talk to on a call.\nPeople LOVE getting on podcasts.\nI wanted to talk with Justin Welsh, so I asked him to do a podcast, and that gave new vision for my brand.\nOur chat on one-person businesses was the catalyst for me gaining 150k subscribers in less than 6 weeks on YouTube.\nThat\u2019s another next step.\nYou can go straight to YouTube with your previous writing.\nYou can literally see the increase in confidence you get after creating 6 months of videos.\nYou become less awkward, more concise, and more impactful.\nYour business compounds as your confidence does.\n3) Create A Product Or Service\nBy now you are growing an audience.\nYou have people.\nWell, hopefully. If you don\u2019t, you need to zoom out and realize it\u2019s a skill issue. You need a big picture understanding of social media to get eyes on good content however you can.\nMoney requires people and a product.\n\u201cProduct\u201d can also include services here. It is what you sell to the people you\u2019ve attracted.\nThis is the only way to make money.\nYou can aim to be one of the select few that lives off of ad revenue (generated from the social media platform) alone, but you will be a slave to the algorithm.\nCreating your own product or service is how you take control of your income.\nSocial media as a skill becomes a faucet that you can turn on whenever you want to make more money.\nYou know how to attract people and you have a product that sells.\n(There\u2019s a lot that goes into both, you will need to improve at both.)\nI\u2019ve written about this extensively, so here are some letters to learn how to create a product:\n\u2013 An overview of the one person business model\n\u2013 The best way to create an offer even as a beginner\n\u2013 How to productize the $100,000 worth of knowledge in your head\nThe reason building a product or service helps with confidence is this:\nYou will suck at first. This is the case for literally anything else you do. Don\u2019t see it as scary just because business seems foreign to you.\nYou get direct feedback on what can be improved. People can be brutal, but most are nice.\nIf you want to actually make money, you need to actually provide value. If you aren\u2019t continuing to grow your audience or money \u2013 maybe start thinking about how valuable you really are.\nThat\u2019s it for this one my friends.\nGo practice confidence as a skill, for life.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "This letter may get peoples\u2019 panties in a bunch.\nSo, I ask that you keep an open mind.\nWithout an open mind, there is no chance to receive a kernel of truth (no matter how small) from someone else\u2019s perspective in a way that can help your life.\nRemember, that is my intention.\nTo help rather than hurt.\nIf you misinterpret what I say, no matter how harsh, it will be you that hurts yourself.\nEven if my intention were to hurt you, some people may see that as a positive. If you choose to be hurt, you will be hurt.\nIf you feel your mind start to close, resist the urge to lash out. You know this feeling. It is hard to have any other thought than the negative garbage you\u2019ve been programmed with by the external world.\nWith that, let\u2019s get straight in.\nYou\u2019re a slave.\nI\u2019m a slave.\nSlaves don\u2019t know they\u2019re slaves if everyone else is too.\nJust because the \u201cslavery\u201d that everyone knows and hates is no longer a thing, doesn\u2019t mean that slavery doesn\u2019t still exist.\nNo, I\u2019m not talking about sex slavery, although many porn abusers could fall under that category.\nI\u2019m talking about mental and financial slavery.\nSlave (noun) \u2013 a person who is forced to work for and obey another and is considered to be their property.\nThe key word in that definition is \u201cforce.\u201d\nForce can have multiple definitions and contexts.\nFor the sake of coherence, we are going to use this definition:\nForce (noun) \u2013 strength or energy as an attribute of physical action or movement.\nIn other words, there is something pushing you to do one thing over the other. The stronger that \u201csomething\u201d is, the more enslaved you are.\nA slave of the past could run away, in some cases, but they would run out of food, water, and shelter to the point of death.\nWith this said, slavery is influenced by survival.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed earlier, human survival is not physical, it is conceptual.\nHumans survive form, self, ego, or identity. However you want to label a distinction within consciousness.\nSome common examples:\nPolitical Ideologies\nIf you identify as a Republican or Democrat, and your beliefs are challenged, you will feel a physical stress response that encourages you to defend those beliefs.\nYour survival feels threatened because you consider an idea a part of who you are, which is also an idea.\nSports Teams\nHave you ever noticed people get visibly angry when they argue about which sports team will win? Especially if they have money on the line.\nYour \u201cteam spirit\u201d makes you feel as if you are a part of something larger than yourself. It is your spirituality. But it doesn\u2019t have to make your mental health worse.\nYour Identity\nAre you a coffee snob? Health expert? Productive person?\nIf someone tells you to stop drinking coffee, how do you feel? If someone tells you that the keto diet is best, how do you feel? Do you want to educate them on what you \u201cknow\u201d is best or that you have experience with? The ideology that you have attached to your identity and feel the need to survive? Even when you know that blanket statements don\u2019t apply to every single person on Earth across different cultures with different resources?\nIf you\u2019re productive, and you move to a new location, how do you feel? Your routine just got destroyed out of nowhere. You were surviving the form that is your routine through effort, energy, and habit. You need a week or two to \u201cacclimate,\u201d right?\nThis is where I am often a slave. To my routines.\nReligious Ideologies\nEven if people say they don\u2019t care to convert you to their belief system, they still do so unconsciously. Because they are conditioned to reproduce their identity.\nSurvival includes reproduction, and any ideas we transfer to another through communication influence the identity of another person.\nYour \u201cself\u201d is a concept. It is a web of ideas and beliefs. Those ideas and beliefs can change with time. Any piece of information you consume has an impact on who you are.\nHence why mental phone slaves often end up unsuccessful. All they do is consume self-deprecating memes and numb their mind to avoid confronting the truth of their situation.\nSlavery is powerful because if we are conditioned to survive an identity, like a job title, and if we think about quitting that job, the force of our survival being at stake keeps us tied to it.\nSociety Is A Pyramid Scheme Of Attention\nIf it is not given attention, it doesn\u2019t exist.\nIf it doesn\u2019t exist, attention must be invested for it to survive.\nThis brings two realizations:\n1) You are contributing to unconscious destruction.\nHow do mega-corporations grow and thrive?\nThey start small and form a power hierarchy with time.\nFewer people with more power at the top, more people with less power at the bottom.\nThe top tier of the hierarchy (the company and executives) can only do what they do because a plethora of people are giving attention to the tasks, vision, and values from the bottom up.\nThe bottom is composed of low-skill grunt work, like a cashier at McDonalds, and moves up to marketing and business operations until you reach the top.\nBy nature, it is impossible for a large number of people to rise up this hierarchy.\nThe problem is that people at the bottom are unconscious of the impact they have with their work.\nLike how McDonalds is poisoning the population with their food (do cashiers have extensive nutrition and health knowledge? No, or else they wouldn\u2019t be working there, they would probably be in the nutrition field).\nOr how military programmers write code for drones that execute orders to kill people on the other side of the country.\nOr even a web designer for a course creator that scams people.\n\u201cForgive them for they know not what they do.\u201d\n2) You can bring a conscious vision into reality.\nThe only way to escape is to build your own thing.\nBut this is increasingly difficult when you are a slave to that which sucks up your time and energy.\nIt\u2019s taken you 20, 30, maybe even 40 years to drill yourself into this reality. It shouldn\u2019t take that long to get out, but have some patience.\nThe way out is to become a value creator.\nTrue value is creative.\nCreativity allows for change and emergence.\nIt allows the form, ego, or identity it was trying to survive to evolve into something new.\nIf the only value you have to offer is physical, you will get stuck in manual labor jobs (while the people at the top earn with their minds).\nAs we always talk about, you must:\nPush the boundaries of the unknown\nLearn and discover new potentials along the way\nAcquire the skills necessary to build a purposeful product\nSolve your own problems so you create a solution of true value\nStart a business as a vessel to actualize your vision for the future\nYou must create your own conscious hierarchy that minimizes unconscious destruction.\nThe Wage Slave\nI\u2019m tired of both sides of the argument.\n\u201c9-5 workers are slaves!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Johnny, if you work a 9-5 you aren\u2019t a slave.\u201d\nBoth are wrong. Both are right.\nBoth are trying to get maximum engagement and boost the status of their brand. They don\u2019t zoom out and think if people are actually slaves. A published idea without depth and understanding is a disservice to humanity.\nThe fact of the matter is that 95%+ of 9-5 workers are slaves.\nYour feelings don\u2019t matter here. If you do feel threatened by words on a screen, then maybe there is some truth to what I\u2019m saying. Look inward and see what you are hiding from.\nMost workers are the literal definition of a slave.\nIf you cannot stop showing up to work for your survival and have no skills to open other options immediately, and you are the \u201cproperty\u201d or employee of a certain company\u2026 that\u2019s a slave.\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be happy.\nEveryone is a slave in one way or another, and we all have waves of happiness in our life.\nIf happiness is the feeling we get when our attention is distracted from the vast unhappiness in the world, then slavery may make some people happier than non-slaves.\nYou can be happy (at points in your life) while being unconscious of the problems in your life.\nBut once you are aware of them, truly aware of them, then you will feel the pull to evolve.\nI am not here to demonize 9-5 jobs.\nI see them as a necessary stepping stone.\nI also see entry-level business models like agency work, freelancing, coaching, and even digital products as stepping stones in your life\u2019s work. They can easily enslave you.\nA personal brand, however, is not a business model. It is how you build an audience for any product or service you wish to distribute as you evolve.\nA personal brand is your character in the digital society.\nMany people will get trapped in a certain level of the hierarchy. Maybe that\u2019s their destiny. And that\u2019s fine.\nVirtual realities, like video games, have a constructed society that is held together by NPCs (Non-Player Characters). On the internet, these are the unconscious trolls, consumers, and reply guys.\nThe truth is that most people will remain unconscious of the impact they have on the world.\nI can\u2019t change them, you can\u2019t change them, but we can change what we do in our own lives.\nEntrepreneurship Is Modern Survival\nEntrepreneurship is the only logical option for long-term thinkers.\nIf you stay in a 9-5 job for too long, you become a monkey in a cubicle.\nYour psyche is wired to hunt.\nTo hunt is to make novel discoveries that aid in your survival.\nImagine our ancestors walking by a bare bush every day. It doesn\u2019t serve their future.\nBut one day, it grows new berries.\nSomebody walks by it, they notice it, and that novelty causes excitement. They either gather the berries or remember them for later so they can survive longer.\nWhen you get stuck in a 9-5 (or a new 9-5 like an agency or freelancing) you live in the eternal known. You can\u2019t make new discoveries in the known.\nYou get bored, depressed, and see life as meaningless because the only dopamine you get is from superficial sources.\nYou never take risks, push into the unknown, and discover new knowledge, tools, and potentials that raise dopamine levels in the brain.\nYou must evolve.\nEntrepreneurship is the path of uncertainty.\nLike slashing your way through the jungle.\nYou are required to learn skills that aren\u2019t taught in schools.\nYou are required to be okay with failure, rejection, and slow progress.\nYou are required to learn from your mistakes, show up again tomorrow, and push until your strike gold.\nAs an entrepreneur, you \u201chunt\u201d for your survival by gathering knowledge, creating a valuable product, and putting it in front of people that could benefit from it.\nAs I\u2019ve discussed, my path for doing this is to:\nStart a personal brand as the foundation\nSolve your own problems in the real world (health, wealth, relationships)\nDistribute your findings, opinions, and beliefs via writing\nStart with a freelance or coaching service and get results\nSell a physical or digital product that requires less time invested (once your audience grows)\nMake a hefty income in 2-4 years with persistence and iteration\nExpand your vision for the future and build whatever you want to get there (software, spaceships, whatever you want)\nThis is the entire process I give, with templates and education, inside Digital Economics.\nSkill & Opportunity\nI am a slave to many things in life, but I would like to believe that I\u2019ve escaped wage slavery.\nIf my business got wiped from the face of the earth, I can still:\nCreate a product or service that someone else needs\nCall, email, advertise, and spread internet content to drive traffic to that offer\nMake $5-10K in the first month and improve that with the data I\u2019ve gathered\nWhy can I do this but most can\u2019t?\nBecause over the past 10 years, I\u2019ve learned graphic design, video editing, copywriting, psychology, web development, marketing, sales, email marketing, speaking, audience building, advertising, product design, course creation, idea generation, lifestyle design, bodybuilding, nutrition, and more that people struggle with.\nWith $0 to my name, I could create a service that teaches people how to create a landing page that sells.\nI would charge $1000-$2500 for a 4-call \u201cboot camp\u201d depending on how I want to structure the offer.\nI would target new businesses that have a full website (because that isn\u2019t even close to an optimal way to sell a product or service). Or I would target students who want to learn a profitable skill outside of employment. Or I would target creators that want the first step in monetizing their brand outside of platform revenue.\nI would spend 3 hours in the morning DMing people and writing marketing content online.\nPeople will read this and try to replicate it.\nYet, they will fail because they don\u2019t understand how powerful experience is. There are so many subtle nuances and thought processes that a beginner has to reprogram with effort.\nWhen you go to school, you are narrowed in on a few select skills that train you into an employable position.\nWith every skill I learn outside of school, I can spot multiple opportunities that allow me to earn an income outside of a job.\nThis effect compounds.\nWith the skills I\u2019ve developed, I can write out 50 different products that I know will be profitable within the first 6 months of my efforts.\nSkill is determined by experience here.\nYou can\u2019t just learn about them and expect to see what I can in the market.\nYou haven\u2019t failed to the point of understanding the nuance behind all of this business stuff.\nIf you want to escape, here\u2019s how you discover opportunity and develop the skill to actualize it:\n1) Drown In New Information To Program Your Mind\nMost people are drowning in information that has nothing to do with their goals.\nThey don\u2019t have a vision, goal, or problem to interpret information through.\nChances are you\u2019ve already read life-changing information, but it didn\u2019t register in your awareness.\nWith the goal of \u201cescaping wage slavery\u201d at the top of your mind, you can:\nSchedule a minimum of 20 minutes dedicated to consuming information that will help with that goal.\nBuy books, use your Audible credits, save podcasts, follow new social accounts, and add new videos to your \u201cWatch Later\u201d on YouTube\nGet out of your house, have a notes app open on your phone, and write down your discoveries as you immerse yourself in the information.\nYou will feel the dopamine in your brain on your hunt for a better life.\n2) Study Purposeful Businesses You Aspire To Build\nNow that you have a consumption habit, you need a more practical goal to apply what you are learning.\nWhat business do you build to escape wage slavery?\nTake mental note of the apps and activities you incorporate on a daily basis.\nLook at who you follow and the businesses they\u2019ve built.\nBuy a book or course on a specific business model that interests you.\nYou must discover a business model that you feel pulled to build.\nOne you can become obsessed with.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter which one it is.\nEmulation built my first successful businesses.\nIt helped me identify blindspots.\nThose blindspots were usually the crucial piece that kept me from seeing success.\nGet in the habit of studying people you want to be like, downloading and purchasing everything they have to offer, and making a mindmap of everything they have online (social media profiles, websites, landing pages, email sequences, products, services, lead magnets, books, everything).\nReverse engineer what allows them to be successful.\nIf you don\u2019t know what to do after that, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\n3) Become Your Own Dopamine Dealer\nMy friend and I were having a discussion the other day.\nI\u2019ll paraphrase what he said.\nYou know what\u2019s wild\u2026 I remember asking you why none of your friends take action or follow in your footsteps. I get it now.\nPeople are dopamine junkies, even businessmen.\nThe people that don\u2019t take action don\u2019t know how to replace the dopamine they are getting from their current habits with business.\nSo, they either don\u2019t start or quit after a week because they couldn\u2019t get their hit.\nThis made me think back and realize what made it work for me.\nI was constantly chasing that good ol\u2019 dopamine, but in the right direction.\nSo, my advice:\nHold a loose idea of what you want in life (money, success, peace, fulfillment).\nStart building something, anything, that will make that a reality \u2013 I would, of course, recommend a one-person business because it is long-term.\nLearn what you want to learn the most to help build it (skills, courses, websites, logos, whatever) so you get your dopamine hit.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to change what you are doing if you get bored.\nI attribute my unique success to \u201cshiny object syndrome.\u201d\nI tried and failed at 7 different business models.\nWhat most don\u2019t see is that I wouldn\u2019t be here without those failures.\nThe skills I learned with each compounded into better opportunities.\nMy tweets wouldn\u2019t be the same without copywriting.\nMy web pages wouldn\u2019t be the same without web design.\nMy profile picture and branding wouldn\u2019t be the same without Photoshop art.\nThe list goes on.\nReplace the habits that keep you enslaved with habits that will break you free.\nIt won\u2019t happen immediately.\nBe okay with that.\nIf you can stay on the path, you win."

        "content": "Life is like a dark room.\nOn occasion, we find a candle so that we can see, but not for long.\nThe candle provides vision and direction.\nBut the flame will die out, sparking fear in our souls that we will never find our way\u2026 unless we move with faith that we will find the next candle.\nThe human mind bounces between clarity and chaos.\nChaos is our default state.\nClarity is the byproduct of ordered information that fills our consciousness. Our mind is clear when what we pay attention to is clear.\nThis is an explanation for human behavior.\nAnd explains why people report that the most miserable part of their days is between 10am and 2pm on a Sunday afternoon.\nPeople hate their jobs, yet jobs provide a more enjoyable state of mind than being alone with yourself and your random thoughts.\nHumans fill their day with activities that structure their minds.\nWe always want to be doing something. Seeing people. Playing games. Writing. Designing. Creating. Preferably investing our attention in something useful.\nWhen we are alone, psychic entropy ensues.\nWe catch on to a coherent line of thought for no more than a few minutes, then get lost in the unknown.\nOur mind grasps at negative thoughts and they multiply.\nThe cure to this state of mind is knowing how to direct your attention.\nMeditation teaches you to focus on your breath.\nMeta-cognition teaches you to question your thoughts.\nLearning to be alone is learning to order your mind in any circumstance for enjoyment.\nIt\u2019s ironic that people want to maximize freedom.\nThat\u2019s the opposite of what they want.\nPeople don\u2019t want freedom, they want autonomy.\nThey don\u2019t want limitations projected on them, they want to create their own limitations.\nYour self is a definition.\nSelf-imposed or accepted limits.\nThe self is your psychic body. You are not physical.\nYou are an amalgamation of the ideas, beliefs, and distinctions that you perceive as important based on your programming.\nYour self determines how you interpret situations which determines how you act.\nYour self determines your destiny.\nYou are free to define yourself however you want, but most people accept who the world says they are.\nIf your self was unlimited, then you would die, because death is metaphorical.\nIt is the destruction of distinction within consciousness.\nIf the distinction between self and other is dissolved, then the form that is your self is dead. Ego death. You become one with the Universe. Most people want this because it sounds cool. It\u2019s another status game to them.\nAlright alright enough with the abstractions, let\u2019s make this practical.\nClarity is the key to enjoyment.\nBut enjoyment isn\u2019t the only piece of the puzzle.\nWe can enjoy a life that someone assigns to us, but that does not bring fulfillment.\nSustainable, long-term clarity comes from 2 sources:\n1) Self-generated goals in alignment with a conscious future.\n2) Soceity-generated goals in alignment with an unconscious future.\nOne is created, one is assigned.\nIf we don\u2019t want our life to be the product of someone else\u2019s vision, we must take control of our own.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nMost People Don\u2019t Need Motivation, They Need Clarity\nMotivation is like standing on one side of a canyon.\nThe other side looks like a Utopia. Everything you could ever want. Beautiful people, music, cars, houses, all calling your name to take the leap, but you don\u2019t have a way to get over the canyon.\nClarity is the first plank of the bridge toward the other side.\nMotivation can be illustrated with the behavior molecule, dopamine.\nWhen something is \u201cfar\u201d away from us, we desire it more.\nWhen we acquire that thing \u2013 like a house, car, pretty person, watch, or even something like an internet course \u2013 we feel good for a bit.\nBut then it becomes normal.\nWe know this as the \u201choneymoon\u201d phase.\nNow, dopamine is not bad. It\u2019s one of the most important neurotransmitters in your life. It is the drive behind your dreams.\nThe problem is that we don\u2019t know how to utilize it.\nMost people drown in motivation.\nThey see so many things out of their reach, especially on social media.\nOver and over again they waste the most precious energy source to act on their dreams.\nAnd even if they do acquire what they want, like a car, they don\u2019t know how to swap their focus to sustain their enjoyment of that thing.\nThe \u201chere and now\u201d neurotransmitters like serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins, and endocannabinoids give you satisfaction and appreciation for what\u2019s in front of you.\nWhile some people take drugs like molly and marijuana to send them into the present moment (I\u2019m not judging, I\u2019ve taken them too), there are more sustainable ways to do this.\n1) Mindfulness & Detail\nNotice the detail that your senses can provide.\nWhen you are on a walk, try to see more than you\u2019ve seen before.\nSnap out of your mindless and \u201cnormal\u201d routine of living on the surface.\nNotice the extravagant detail in the leaves of a tree, the blades of grass, and the shine of the light on cars as they pass by.\nWhen you cook a meal, notice the differences in texture, taste, and feel. Try to pick apart the ingredients.\nWhen listening to a song, dig deep. Can you hear the subtle layers in the background? Those were intentional by the Creator. They want you to notice them.\nYou can see why food critics, music lovers, and yogis enjoy certain activities so much. Because the present moment is enjoyable.\nThis is reality. An ever-flowing quality of experience.\nApply this strategy when you acquire something that is border lining boredom. There is an entire world you have yet to discover.\n2) Developing An Intrinsic Philosophy\nLet\u2019s imagine a young bodybuilder.\nThey start going to the gym for vanity, but stay for therapy.\nThey desire a strong, aesthetic physique so they can attract a partner and command respect.\nBut, after a year or two, their progress drastically slows down.\nThey\u2019ve built a great body, but what\u2019s next?\nIt didn\u2019t change how many people they attracted. Maybe it bumped them up in the social hierarchy a bit. But for what? A bit more attention? Is it worth spending 7-8 hours a week on this still?\nSo, they look inward.\nWhat has this brought to my life?\nWhy do I keep showing up every day?\nWhere would I have spent my time otherwise?\nHow has this impacted the people I meet, the conversations I can have, and the career opportunities open to me?\nThey realize that their material pursuit was deeply immaterial. As are most, but people glance over that fact.\nTheir pursuit for better gave them an identity that influenced positive decisions. It prevented them from being like the mindless masses.\nThe lesson:\nIt\u2019s better to pursue something superficial than it is to do nothing with your life. You either learn what you don\u2019t want, so you can pursue what you want, or you find depth, meaning, and spirituality along the way.\n3) Learning & Education\n95% of people will scoff at someone that buys a new Porsche GT3.\nThat\u2019s because they only see the surface.\nAnd they can\u2019t open their mind to think that the other person\u2019s identity is more than just that snapshot of their life.\nWhat if the person that bought it was a mechanic?\nWhat if they derived deep satisfaction from digging into the machinery?\nNow, what if the average Joe made the same purchase, but decided to learn something new? Rather than sitting around and acquiring more material?\nThey can learn their way into a deeper crevice of reality through education.\nThey study the car\u2019s parts, history, and how to drive better.\nThey start visiting the track and the car becomes a consistent part of their lifestyle. One that brings enjoyment and flow.\nThey construct a house of meaning under the foundation of material. Most people keep laying a foundation and never build anything worth keeping.\nWith this knowledge, the key to the good life is a disciplined balance between meaningful dopamine sources and creating satisfaction when you achieve those goals.\nEnjoyment VS Pleasure (Choose Your Dopamine Sources Wisely)\nEnjoyment comes from investing attention.\nPleasure comes from spending attention.\nInvestments are long-term.\nPurchases are short-term.\nEnjoyment is process focused.\nPleasure is outcome focused.\nEnjoyment is progress toward a long-term goal.\nPleasure is achieving a goal without effort.\nOur goal is to maximize the enjoyment in our everyday life. That\u2019s all anyone is trying to do. But they don\u2019t zoom out enough to create a perspective that is distraction-proof. They focus on what can bring pleasure right here and now.\nWe don\u2019t want to get stuck scrolling social media, having meaningless sex (in more ways than physical), and winning arguments in the comments that lead to absolutely nothing but time wasted.\nWe want to act on our goals, build something beneficial in reality, and impact others in a way that brings enjoyment to our lives.\nThe Anti-Vision\nI talk a lot about having a vision for the future.\nWhy?\nBecause at every point in my life where I have made substantial progress (and enjoyed every second of it) I was hellbent on actualizing a vision I held in my mind.\nPeople that have experienced the same know this power.\nThat\u2019s why I write about it so much.\nI want to understand it more.\nI want to write to the point of having a process that helps more people create and actualize their own vision.\nOne concept I\u2019ve coined that has helped many is the Anti-Vision.\nIn brief, it is how you realize what you don\u2019t want.\nThe things you hate and don\u2019t want as a part of your life.\nDoes this mean you can get rid of them immediately?\nOf course not.\nYou can\u2019t just quit your job or move out of your hometown if you\u2019ve built an entire house of responsibilities around it. There is more on the line than just money if you quit your job. Be smart about this. Long term game.\nTo create your anti-vision:\n1) Observe society as a habit \u2013 Pay close attention to the people around you in any situation. Why do they do what they do? What is it leading towards? Are they somebody that you want to be?\nIt could be as simple as observing the groceries in their basket, observing their body, and realizing you don\u2019t want to end up slow, overweight, and lazy through your shopping habits.\n2) Reflect on your past \u2013 What are experiences that you never want to experience again? What were the lowest lows of your life? What caused them? Have you done anything to prevent that from happening again?\nMake this a conscious practice in your life.\n3) Make a list of what you don\u2019t want \u2013 Pull out a notebook and get specific. This list should make you uncomfortable.\nKeep this somewhere safe. When something new comes to mind, add to it.\n4) Realize where you will be if you keep doing the same thing \u2013 You are your habits. Where will your life end up if you have the same lifestyle in 10 years?\nDo you want that?\n5) Transmute that energy into a passionate vision \u2013 What will you have to learn, build, and execute daily to avoid your anti-vision?\nIf you want to turn your vision into a brand, and your notes into content so you can build an authentic one-person business, check out 2 Hour Writer here.\nThe Vision\nYour vision is your frame.\nIt is what you hold in the back of your mind to guide your daily actions.\nIt\u2019s not about having long-term or short-term focus, it\u2019s about having both.\nNow that you\u2019ve created a specific anti-vision for your future, you\u2019ve primed your mind for pattern recognition.\nYes, it is helpful to get specific on what you want out of life, but I will leave that to you.\nTake the time to write out the opposite of your anti-vision. Get specific as to what your dream life looks like.\nBy doing this you allow your mind to register opportunities you would have normally missed.\nYour vision may not be \u201cstrong\u201d yet, but you cannot improve what doesn\u2019t exist.\nWith your vision in the back of your mind, start executing a better future through education, practice, and building.\nHow To Learn & Build\nSchools can\u2019t, and won\u2019t, teach you how to build your dreams.\nSchools are intimately connected with the government, politics, and economy. Their conditioning process (education) is set up to keep these things going.\nAnything that gives individuals power is a threat.\nSelf-education is a requirement on your journey.\nIt\u2019s obvious, you can\u2019t achieve your goals at your current level of development.\nYou will have to learn the skills necessary to achieve them.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be challenging otherwise, would it?\nChallenge plays a crucial role in the flow state, enjoyment, and dopamine \u2013 but only if you take on challenges that aren\u2019t too boring or difficult. Play at your level, but try to make it to the next level.\nIf you want to retain everything you learn (or at least the important things, not the noise) then you must build as you learn.\nHere\u2019s what you do:\n1) Write Down 10-20 Specific Skills, Interests, or Topics That Will Actualize Your Vision\nNow, we need clarity on what we need to do every single day to actualize our vision.\nMost people fail to make tangible progress because they don\u2019t realize that a lifelong habit of education, skill acquisition, and practice is how you build a better life.\nThis is not optional.\nIf you don\u2019t have time carved out each day to practice your craft, for life, then you aren\u2019t going to make it anywhere meaningful.\nLife itself is a practice and people aren\u2019t showing up.\nThey sit at home and distract themselves with mindless entertainment.\nYou don\u2019t have your ideal lifestyle because you aren\u2019t living that lifestyle now, but on a smaller scale. As you get better at what you do, the time you spend doing it will increase, and money will become inevitable.\nThe key to all of this is specificity.\nDon\u2019t write down \u201cweb design.\u201d\nWrite down \u201chow to create landing pages that are actually useful to businesses.\u201d\nDon\u2019t write down \u201cthe gym.\u201d\nWrite down \u201cdiet and training principles to lose 10 pounds of fat in 6 weeks.\u201d\nDo this 10 times minimum.\nIf you don\u2019t see how the skills or interests will aid in your vision, remove them.\n2) Leverage Dopamine Through Pattern Recognition & Momentum\nConnecting ideas or noting patterns in reality raises dopamine levels in the brain.\nIt\u2019s the same reason cocaine feels so good (dopamine) but this is much more sustainable. It is addictive.\nThis process becomes more powerful with momentum.\nThink of it like doing a sudoku puzzle.\nYou come up with one answer \u2013 dopamine increases.\nThen, like magic, other answers click into place and you can\u2019t stop solving the puzzle \u2013 dopamine compounds.\nThe same thing happens when you have an idea at night that triggers 10 more that keep you awake.\nWhen you notice one idea that connects to your vision, your signal-to-noise ratio increases.\nYour attention narrows on more relevant information and your mind lights up with excitement.\nThis is why it feels so good to \u201clive with purpose.\u201d\n3) Learn & Build \u2013 Eliminate Useless Information\nEveryone is telling you what to do.\nThey\u2019re projecting what they deem important onto you.\nIf you aren\u2019t where you want to be in life, nothing is as important as your goals.\nNot the news, not your friends\u2019 relationship problems, and definitely not who\u2019s getting elected.\nOn the election part \u2013 why are people so up in arms about gas prices and whether or not they can have a baby?\nBecause it\u2019s easier to submit a vote than it is to change your life.\nI\u2019m not saying these issues aren\u2019t important to you, I\u2019m saying that \u201cvoting\u201d is the worst way to go about it.\nZoom out.\nBuild a business so you don\u2019t have to worry about gas prices.\nBuild an audience and present your perspective to millions so you actually have an impact on the votes of your bodily rights.\nThe only way to bring your vision into reality is to create.\nTo create, you need boundaries for your creativity (or else things get too chaotic and overwhelming.\nYou need goals turned into projects so you have something tangible to work on. These provide the boundaries for your learning and creativity.\nBreak down your vision into goals now. Yearly, monthly, weekly.\nTurn all of them into milestones for a tangible project you can work on, like a personal brand or one person business. Something that is holistic and evolved with you. Not a static business model that sounds too good to be true.\nWith your vision and project in mind, start building and learning.\nWork on your project daily regardless of if you know what you are doing.\nYou don\u2019t know what you are doing because you haven\u2019t encountered a problem to frame your learning.\nThat is the best way to learn.\nEncounter a real-world problem.\nResearch specific information to solve it.\nKeep a steady flow of information from your consumption.\nSolve the problem, enjoy the dopamine, and let momentum carry you into a season of intensity.\nThe rest is in your hands.\n\u2013 Dan"

Society shapes itself around those jobs, careers, or businesses.\nCreating a new way of earning money or making businesses more profitable will have society adapt to increase its wealth.\nThe book predicted what I have been preaching for the past year.\nThat the future of work is play.\nThat individuals can grow a one-person business with the new technologies available to them.\nThat the one-person business model can make $1-$5 million a year with 90-95% profit margins, so society is adapting to reflect that.\nThat everyone is an entrepreneur, social media is the new society, and that personal brands or creators are the people of that society.\nThat there\u2019s a reason everyone wants to be a \u201cYouTuber\u201d when they grow up. Although it may be exaggerated as a child, people feel the natural pull to do what they love and help others along the way. And there is a way for the majority of the population to do this (maybe not only on YouTube, of course, but we will see technology and social media continue to move toward this reality).\nEvolution reflects human desire.\nWe solve problems to make that desire come true.\nSocial media solved so many problems that we have yet to realize its true impact.\nThat the creator economy is a decentralized entity composed of brands (or city-states) and creators (or individual estates) that maintain their own sovereignty.\nIf you want to take part in the next phase of human evolution, becoming a Value Creator is the answer.\nThe Importance Of Education\nEducation is the first step in value creation.\nHow are you going to create anything worth distributing if you don\u2019t become a person of value?\nYes, to join in on the new, profitable economy you will need to do something with your life. Shocker.\nBut, conventional education won\u2019t cut it.\nThe current school system is just that, a system.\nA system that molds you into the workforce.\nIt teaches the obedience and skills necessary to work a job in the old economy.\nIf you want to make money in the new economy, then obviously you must seek education that teaches you how to.\nCourses, coaching, and content from brands and creators that have created those ways of making money.\nNew jobs are being created left and right.\nThe ones where boomers will tell you to \u201cget a real job.\u201d\nEvery great idea started as blasphemy until it became the normal way of doing things.\nThis area is still developing.\nIt makes sense why many have bad experiences with scammers.\nThey are few and far between nowadays, especially if you have some critical thinking skills to avoid it, but there are ample people to learn from.\nLifelong self-education to adapt to the changing digital landscape is a necessity to do business in this space.\nEducation shapes the future because it shapes human behavior.\nEducation expands your perspective and allows you to spot opportunities in unknown territory.\nThe new education system is being built online before your eyes.\nSet a goal.\nFind creators you resonate with.\nDrown yourself in the information they provide.\nWatch new opportunities register in your awareness.\nAct on them like your life depends on it.\nThe Rise Of The Value Creator\nIn short, Value Creators are those that:\nEarn with their mind, not their time (so they can stay as a one-person business without limiting their income). One man\u2019s labor cannot scale, but their creative ability can.\nResearch their obsessions and distill their learnings with writing, video, and other internet content.\nGet paid for aggregated knowledge and experience in the form of digital products (or physical products if you want, but everyone should have some form of digital product).\nHave a heavy focus on educating their audience (instead of posting memes, starting drama, or other things like that).\nValue creators are those that dedicate themselves to their interests, take it on as their life\u2019s work to explore them, and distill the information in the form of education.\nThis is the style of one-person business that I teach.\nCreating social media content to build distribution under your name.\nTargeting yourself as the niche. That\u2019s who you sell to and create content for.\nBuilding an education product or service that your past self could have used (like a course, coaching, or tutoring offer).\nThen, when you reach however much you want to make ($100K \u2013 $3M a year\u2026 with time) you can build whatever else you are passionate about.\nYou actively create an evolving education system by becoming an expert in the skills and interests you are passionate about.\nThe government can\u2019t and will not nurture a curriculum that gives individuals the tools that lead to the dissolution of the old economy.\nCreators Are DJs With Ideas\nDJs play music sets.\nThey mix together their own songs, other\u2019s songs that fit well, and remix to craft a story for the crowd listening.\nTechnology has evolved to allow electronic DJs to create almost any sound they want (limited by their creativity, mind, and perspective).\nWith software and skill, they can blend together sounds, edit how they sound, and create music that people give their attention.\nCreators are no different.\nThey collect ideas of their own, others, and remixes of their favorites. Then, they weave them together with the evergreen skills: writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.\nWith time, they attract an audience that invests their attention in those ideas. With that attention, they can benefit humanity and make an income doing what they enjoy.\nOne mistake that creators run into:\nPeople want to hear the same sounds from their favorite artists over and over again.\nIf my favorite dubstep artist switched to country music, he would lose 90% of his audience.\nEven if he tried to create a new dubstep style, he would have to condition his audience\u2019s minds to enjoy it with time. Like how you don\u2019t like a genre until you listen to it enough (the same goes for any interest, goal, or skill you are pursuing \u2013 passion comes from invested energy).\nThe same goes for value creators.\nIf your favorite creator stopped making the one-person business content that grew me to this point, my audience would fall off.\nYou can see this in my YouTube views. There are a select few big ideas that bring me traction.\nYour job as a creator is to find this angle and milk it for eternity.\nNotice how I am able to \u201cremix\u201d what I am saying with all of my interests. From philosophy to spirituality to evolutionary psychology.\nGet creative.\nPeople do not care if you repeat what you say.\nThe ones that are interested in your work prefer it.\nYou can\u2019t and will not retain everything I say in this letter with one read. Content creation is programming. It is a requirement to be repetitive if you want to be remembered.\nThe number one reason people fail as value creators:\nThey\u2019re afraid to put themselves on the market (because they don\u2019t think they\u2019re unique).\nHow many pairs of shoes do you have?\nHow many books on the same topic do you read?\nHow many artists in the same genre do you listen to?\nWrite what you would want to read.\nSell a product you would want to buy.\nMake the videos you would want to watch.\nPut your variation of what people want on the market.\nOnly then does your luck increase from 0 to 1%.\nReality Mining To Extract Value\nHow do we start our journey as a value creator?\nBy becoming a mental blacksmith.\nBlacksmiths (in a video game, at least) will mine for ore to fuel their creations. They will smelt the ore and forge it into armor and weapons.\nCreators mine a crevice of reality they are interested in.\nThey study, research, and obsess over topics to collect value they can distribute to their audience.\nWith those ideas, they create armor that they can both wear and give to others.\n\u201cArmor\u201d is perspective to navigate the world in a better way.\nLike how a book can \u201cchange your life\u201d because it gave you the awareness of how to do so.\n\u201cWeapons\u201d are tools for battle.\nThey are the actionable advice, tips, and strategies that people can act on to make progress.\nProgress implies a challenge. A battle that individuals must overcome in their life. You pass down your lessons so others can navigate life more efficiently.\nThis is how you increase the rate of human evolution, through education and worldview programming opposing societal conditioning.\n1) Create A Lens\nAs you are collecting information, ideas, and value \u2013 you need a way to apply this information to test against reality.\nYou need a filter to make your thoughts original. A vessel to channel your creative energy.\nIn other words, you need to build a project in alignment with a goal. One that leads to your vision.\nWhy?\nBecause leaders attract followers.\nThis is your niche and brand. It is how you frame everything you read and write.\nThis is how you create something valuable. Value helps people overcome their problems or achieve their goals. We are aiming to attract people with shared goals.\nThis is how two people read the same book, article, or content and come up with completely different ideas.\nIf you are working towards better health, your mind is a magnet for ideas to aid in that.\nSomeone who is working towards better finances will register different ideas from the information they are consuming.\n2) Pursue Curiosity To Collect Material\nDon\u2019t consume, research.\nThe best creators don\u2019t stop consuming. Instead, they consume for the sake of learning and distributing ideas.\nThis perception shift alone will turn you into an idea-generation machine. Don\u2019t just scroll the internet to entertain yourself. Scroll to educate yourself. This is more powerful than you think.\nYou must fall back in love with learning outside of the traditional education system that made you hate it.\nRead books, listen to podcasts, read blog posts and newsletters, and immerse yourself in information that aligns with your goals.\nHave a notebook, app, or idea-development system to keep your ideas safe. No, you won\u2019t remember them. This step is absolutely critical. I\u2019m not exaggerating. Do it.\nNote down the ideas that raise dopamine in your brain. The ones rivet your attention to them. The one\u2019s that change your perspective and bring you clarity.\nContemplate different angles of the ideas you jot down and how they apply to your vision, goals, and problems in your life.\nThis is what you write about in your content.\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to specific topics (although they are good to write out so you have something to research and collect ideas from).\nYou are distributing ideas in alignment with a goal.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what topic that falls under because chances are it only falls under the topic that is you. This is how you make your content original.\nIf you don\u2019t know what to learn, read The One Person Business Model 2.0 letter.\nIf you want courses that give you exact steps and strategies, check out 2 Hour Writer or Digital Economics.\n3) Create Armor & Weapons\nThe ideas you collect will begin to shape your worldview, baseline perspective, and identity.\nBy programming your own mind, your actions will follow suit.\nThat\u2019s how programming works.\nEven if you are lazy, the pain of inaction toward the opportunities you know exist will outweigh the pain of doing nothing with your life.\nArmor creation: Give people ideas, motivation, and inspiration toward their goals. This shapes their perspective and identity. They can be happier in life and achieve their goals.\nWeapon creation: Give actionable steps, solutions, and advice\nWriting, speaking, marketing, and sales are how you channel your ideas into impactful creations.\nFrom there, you distribute them across social media platforms to build a community in the digital society.\nMonetizing The Creative Ability Of Your Mind\nWe are shifting away from shallow promises and good looks as a way of building an audience.\nThe health industry grows unhealthy because their income is dependent on their looks.\nAnd, this creates poor standards for male and female physiques, contributing to the lack of mental and spiritual health.\nValue creation, again, is the answer.\nFitness influences (that can\u2019t monetize their intelligence or creativity) have to maintain sub-optimal body fat levels and unhealthy habits.\nIf they don\u2019t, their income decreases. I\u2019ve heard this many times across podcasts and YouTube videos from coaches in the industry.\nBusiness must be sustainable and healthy.\nMonetizing your mind or intelligence or creativity is infinite.\nHere\u2019s how you begin, but first, let\u2019s handle some limiting beliefs.\nAnd yes, these are just beliefs. Your mind\u2019s way of avoiding the action you want to take.\nYou can build an audience or readership.\nEvery single person on social media follows 300-1000+ people. Even creators. That\u2019s more than enough to make a full-time income if you know what you are doing.\nMore followers are both a bonus and attainable for most people reading this (you are in the 0.5% of humanity that is aware of this line of work).\nThe market is not saturated.\nIt only seems saturated because you limit yourself to following 300-1000 people that all talk about your interests.\nIn reality, it\u2019s so unsaturated that you can blow past most creators in that niche.\nPair this with my way of \u201cniching down\u201d and you\u2019re gold.\nSimplify Complex Topics\nIf we live in the Information Age\u2026\nAnd the average person is overwhelmed, anxious, and uncertain\u2026\nAnd education is what shapes the selves that go on to create a better future\u2026\nValue creation is sense-making.\nYour job is to make sense of your life, the world, and bring clarity to the actions that others should take. The ones that follow your vision and want to make it reality.\nThis comes with time and action.\nYou will not know if your creations are valuable if you never get eyes on them.\nYou must post. You must get data. You must attract readers to your work, because if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s the first sign that you don\u2019t have value to offer. Or you just don\u2019t know how to play the game.\nMarketing and sales demand people. You need to get your work in front of the market.\nIf you don\u2019t work to get your content in front of people, you won\u2019t know if your ideas are valuable.\nIf you get your content in front of people and it doesn\u2019t do well, then it wasn\u2019t valuable. You need to write better.\nIf you don\u2019t work to get your products in front of people, you won\u2019t make money.\nIf you get your products in front of people and no one buys, your product isn\u2019t perceived as valuable. You need to sell better.\nPerceive is the keyword there.\nMarketing and sales are perception.\nYou have to write, speak, market, and sell in a way that resonates with the identities you are targeting.\nA valley girl won\u2019t resonate with meathead bodybuilding advice.\nA soccer mom (probably) won\u2019t resonate with philosophical musings on business.\nYour language dictates who you attract.\nIt\u2019s all so simple when you stop being distracted by your thoughts and think it through.\nBuilding an audience over time is how you decrease the manual work necessary to get your content and products in front of people.\nOkay, where do we start?\n1) Start With Writing\nWriting forces you to supplement your learning with writing, sales, and persuasion if you want to be a success.\nIt clarifies your thoughts.\nIt makes you more articulate.\nIt can be repurposed into any other medium (speaking, video, or visuals).\nIt is also a seamless, non-demanding, lever-moving task that you can schedule in the first block of each morning.\nSo, we prioritize growth and content on writing platforms.\nStart With A Newsletter\nDepth is what separates you from the superficial market.\nNo, you don\u2019t need subscribers. You can also upload it as a blog post, use it to write lead magnets or product modules, or use it as a YouTube script like I do.\nSubscribers will come.\nCondense The Complexity Into Tweets (Or Threads)\nTwitter, in my eyes, was an underrated writing platform.\nIt still is, but Instagram\u2019s new Threads app is reminding me of Twitter in its infancy.\nThere is a world of opportunity and the community feel is incredible.\nThreads has a lot of potential.\nWhy?\nYou can post as much as you\u2019d like (to test your ideas before you post them on other platforms).\nIt\u2019s writing-based, meaning you don\u2019t need to be a 10/10 model living in Thailand sipping coconuts on the beach.\nIt is like a forum, you can find like-minded people much quicker in the replies of your favorite accounts.\nThe retweet or repost button is a low-friction share feature, that\u2019s how you gain followers (other platforms are harder to grow on as a beginner)\nYou can just screenshot your tweets to grow on other platforms (this is how I grew without spending hours creating new content).\nThe basics of growing on Twitter are simple.\nPost 1-3 times a day (and start getting your \u201cfailures\u201d out of the way)\nIf you are under 1000 followers, focus on networking with other people in the replies and DMs to leverage their audience.\nHave a clickable profile picture so people know you are a creator\nUse your big goal in life OR the interests you talk about as your bio (what are you leading people towards and how will they get there through your unique interests?)\nWrite threads or long posts based on your story and personal experience (but make sure you have a network that will share it so it goes semi-viral)\nStart with beginner-level educational content.\nMake it actionable.\nThat\u2019s what everyone does to grow at the start (on any platform) and 95% of the market are beginners.\nDon\u2019t try to be super clever or wise until you build a name for yourself.\n2) Prioritize Ideas & Attention Capture\nAttention is the currency of the 21st century.\nImpactful ideas are how you generate attention.\nThe best tip I can give you is to read others\u2019 content from the lens of a creator.\nWhy do their posts do well? What caught your attention? Why does it have so much engagement?\nThe answers aren\u2019t always obvious.\nAuthors usually have high engagement because people know their ideas already. But, of course, they are still great writers and are worth studying.\nIn Digital Economics, we dive deep into the psychology of capturing attention, but here are a few principles so you can start now.\nProblems \u2013 every good story captures attention by starting with a problem that the reader is facing. It opens a curiosity loop and makes them want to find the solution. Problems are at the root of human behavior.\nNumbers \u2013 specific numbers are a pattern interrupt when you are scrolling on social media. \u201cI read 347 self-help books so you don\u2019t have to\u201d is an example.\nStatistics \u2013 similar to numbers, statistics set the scene quite nicely. \u201c97% of the population has seen a decline in focus, here\u2019s how to fix yours\u201d is an example that could use a bit of work, but you see the power in it.\n3) Treat Yourself As Your Ideal Reader\nWhen someone is building a readership or audience for the value they are creating, common advice is to write to your ideal customer.\nWith the one-person business, you are your niche. You are your customer avatar. You are your brand, content, and product.\nI have people go through the Myers-Briggs personality test in Digital Economics so they can understand themselves more. When you understand yourself, you can write to yourself. The test results are your customer avatar.\nNow, what do you write?\nIf you are going through a tough time, give yourself advice and write it online in your \u201cpublic journal\u201d\nGive your past self advice on overcoming the problems you faced, but faster\nGive your future self-encouragement to achieve the goals you are trying to achieve.\nThese are just a few of the many ways you can create content, but they are a great (and accessible) starting point.\n4) Turn Your Personal Projects Into Products\nYou won\u2019t have anything to write about if you aren\u2019t pushing toward your goals (in any domain, even if building a brand is your goal, write about it).\nGoals = project you are working on.\nAs you get results, you begin to understand what got those results.\nThis is the foundation of a profitable product or service.\nIf you have built a business, teach people how with a consulting service or digital product.\nIf you have built your body, do the same.\nIf you have built your mind, do the same.\nTeach people how you got the results they want. It\u2019s not that difficult.\nYou will have to study others\u2019 products or services to see how they structured them. This is another bonus of purchasing courses in the new society.\nAgain, if you want to get a job, purchase the overpriced education that trains you into one.\nIf you want to become a creator, purchase the education from the people that form the creator economy.\nI\u2019ve discussed what type of product to sell first in this letter.\nYou can also binge-watch/listen the One Person Business Playlist on YouTube.\nHappy creating.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "That\u2019s what we are here to discuss today.\nIt is a simple framework for creating a better life for yourself.\nBut first, we need to understand its importance.\nWhy is focused work a superpower?\nHappiness is a skill and it\u2019s easier than ever to practice unhappiness.\nHow?\nWe don\u2019t live in the same world as our ancestors.\nThe physical world has changed of course.\nThere are more buildings.\nOur routines are different.\nThe environment changed to reflect human progress and could be detrimental to our long-term health unless we revert back, or we create a sustainable solution.\nBut the mental world? Completely different story.\nAs we continue to build the physical world, our mind has to adapt and evolve to discover and implement new information.\nWe call this creativity, our divine gift.\nThe physical world was here before human consciousness.\nWhen the plane of mind emerged, it transcended and included both the physical and biological.\nMeaning, the physical is a part of the larger biological, and the biological is a part of the larger mental.\nThink of the old world as an acorn.\nThink of the new world as a 100-year-old oak tree (that can live to 600-1000 years old).\nThere is a thick core, it splits off in 3-6 major areas and continues to split into branches that may live or fall off, and thousands of leaves. Each leaf has an ecosystem within itself.\nAnd of course, you may have to prune a branch to encourage growth in the right direction.\nWe can think of this oak tree as a watered-down description of reality.\nThere are infinite branches and leaves to explore, but most are conditioned into the one they learned during childhood. They limit their potential to one of infinite branches through mental programming.\nIf you want, you can think of that one branch as \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d\nThis oak tree is explored with the mind.\nEach branch represents a pathway of information that can be explored with energy, attention, and will.\nThe major problem:\nIt is too easy for modern man to get sucked into a mindless trap of mediocrity, degeneracy, and roboticism.\nWhen people break away from the default path, they get scared of the unknown.\nThere is too much information to explore.\nToo many opportunities cause overwhelm.\nToo many opinions lead to anxiety.\nTo find clarity, you have to battle through the chaos.\nYou can\u2019t just shy away at the first site of struggle.\nFor every good thought, there are 100 bad.\nYour version of success is empowering, but in comes the thought of failure, how long it will take, which skills to learn, and different career and business paths to get there.\nThen, those bad thoughts can splinter into 100 more.\nThat is unless you learn how to order your mind.\nTo create clarity from chaos.\nProgram Or Be Programmed\nThe Age Of Information is overwhelming.\nThe most important thing you can do in these times is curate your digital, mental, and physical environment.\nDigital \u2013 Immerse yourself in the information that will program you for success.\nUnfollow accounts that don\u2019t serve your future.\nBuy books that increase your awareness of your potential.\nSubscribe to podcasts, newsletters, and blogs that teach you what the schools won\u2019t.\nEverywhere you turn, curate a digital environment that makes success inevitable.\nProgram your mind.\nMental \u2013 Treat your mind as a garden. Your thoughts can be well-kept and beautiful, or they can grow like weeds and cause a chaotic downward spiral.\nAs the Arabs say, \u201cThe nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens.\u201d\nPhysical \u2013 People that settle for comfort form settlements. They justify each other\u2019s mediocre lives and are programmed to believe it is normal. The unknown is where your potential lies.\n\u201cThe single most important decision you make is where you live. It drives your business opportunities, relationships, food and water supply, politics, activities, and day-to-day quality of life.\u201d \u2013 Naval\nYou are a product of your environment.\nYour thoughts, emotions, and actions (in that order) are influenced by the people and information within it.\nThought processes become habitual.\nProgrammed into your mind with time.\nMost people wake up after 40 years of robotic living wondering where the time went.\nDon\u2019t be one of them.\nHuman behavior is goal oriented.\nEverything we do is in alignment with a goal.\nEverything.\nEvery decision we make is pushing us toward a conscious or unconscious goal.\nGoals are baked into your identity.\nYour identity influences your perspective of situations.\nYour perspective influences how you perceive problems within that situation.\nSituations can only be viewed by the level of development you are at.\nThis is why so many are bitter, offended, and angry.\nThey stop learning and growing after childhood.\nYou miss out on the depth of life when you choose an early death.\nFor most people, all they know is \u201cgo to school, get a job, retire at 65.\u201d\nThis is why I am so big on people spreading awareness of new opportunities through the creator economy.\nThe mind is a pattern recognition machine.\nAnd as the default life trajectory is conditioned into your mind as a kid through your upbringing, schooling, and what your average friends are doing \u2013 you will do the same.\nIf you don\u2019t program your mind for success, it will be programmed for mediocrity.\nFocus = Quality Of Life\nImagine having a spreadsheet that displayed how much attention you\u2019ve invested in any given area of your life. Mind, body, spirit, and business that impact your relationship with the world and those around you. The spreadsheet would be a direct indicator of your quality of life. \u2013 The Art of Focus\nFocus is the habit of habits.\nConscious focus on your long-to-short-term goals are how you program your mind for success and daily quality of life.\nFocus is the root of your entire being.\nIt\u2019s how you channel your awareness, consciousness, and attention toward value or distraction.\nBoth lead to increased levels of dopamine in the brain.\nDopamine, obviously, makes you feel good.\nDistractions lead to \u201ccheap\u201d dopamine.\nValue leads to \u201cexpensive\u201d dopamine.\nWe want to increase the ratio of expensive to cheap dopamine-raising sources in our life.\nWe want to increase the signal to noise, significance to insignificance, and meaningful to meaningless ratios.\nWe start by creating a hierarchy of self-generated goals.\nIf you don\u2019t have conscious, meaningful goals, you won\u2019t be able to place your focus on those things.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if \u201cyou don\u2019t know\u201d what those goals should be yet.\nPick something that sounds meaningful.\nOnly then can you realize what you don\u2019t want.\nAnd by realizing what you don\u2019t want, you can then focus on something that is closer to what you want.\nWith time, you achieve goals that weren\u2019t assigned to you and forge your own path.\nIf you are interested in high-value skill acquisition or turning yourself into a business, check out 2 Hour Writer or Digital Economics.\nHere\u2019s what you do:\n1) Zoom Out To Gain Perspective\nThink about your ideal future.\nHave you ever done that?\nIf so, when was the last time?\nPull out a notebook and describe it in detail.\nSpend 30 minutes writing out what you think you want.\nMind, body, spirit, business, and how those things will impact every area of your life in a beneficial manner.\nContrast that life with the one you have now.\nThis is your vision for the future.\nA big, meta-goal that houses the rest of your goals.\nThis gives you a lens \u2013 or frame \u2013 to view daily situations from.\nYou are currently viewing situations from a lens of unconscious goals. Your attention is drawn toward things that will help with those goals. Like a job opportunity, person you want to have superficial sex with, or other low-consciousness problem you want to solve in your life.\nNote: you may have to solve these problems to break through to the next level. Superficial pursuits aren\u2019t bad. They can act as a vessel that exposes you to depth. Many start going to the gym for a nice body, but stay for the therapy.\nThink of your frame as a field that filters distractions.\nMost people\u2019s field is projected on them and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t do anything great with their lives.\n2) Deconstruct To Bridge The Clarity Gap\nIn the notebook you pulled out, break each area of your life down into manageable sub-goals.\nWrite out:\nA 10-year goal\nA 1-year goal\nThis month\u2019s goal\nThis week\u2019s goal\nWhat you can do today\nDon\u2019t attach to these goals.\nThis is a practice to generate clarity.\nYour goals will evolve with time, and that\u2019s okay.\nThey may change tomorrow.\nIf you don\u2019t do this, the likelihood of you acting on the goals assigned to you by society is much higher.\nKeep this notebook handy.\nMake a mess, organize it, and act.\n3) Zoom In To Act With Purpose\nHold your frame in the back of your mind.\nRemember, this is a habit you are forming.\nYou are trying to decrease the amount of distraction in your life by bringing your focus back to what you deem important.\nEvery other action, and eventually habit, that you form should be directed toward your vision.\nThis is how you live in alignment.\nYou can feel it.\nThe question is, what do we zoom our focus in on?\nHow do we know we are making progress every day?\nOne Project, One Hour, One Day At A Time\nThe modern world is an infinite web of information.\nIdeas, opportunities, business models, relationship advice, productivity doctrine, conspiracy theories, news, and drama that you can get lost in if you do not train your focus.\nAt your current level in life, 99% of the information you are exposed to is a distraction.\nWe must narrow our minds on the few things that will lead us to a better life.\nThis is unique to the individual.\nOne Meaningful Project\nFrom what you wrote down in your notebook, turn your goals into projects.\nYou are the meta-project.\nYou are your life\u2019s work.\nYou, as a project, are composed of the interconnected planes of existence that make life enjoyable.\nMind, body, spirit, and money (yes, money is necessary. It is the bridge of commerce. The lifeblood of society. It is how you bring the future you want to build to life).\nIn business, these are the eternal markets, where burning, profitable problems exist. Because they are real problems in real people\u2019s lives.\nWhen you create a solution to your own problems within these domains:\nYou unlock the ability to begin a more meaningful (and profitable) project or move to the next phase of life.\nYou can share your solution with others like you that want to be helped \u2013 this is the reasoning behind you as the most profitable niche.\nYou make tangible progress in reality. You don\u2019t get trapped in a cycle of mental masturbation and tutorial hell.\nSo, we must break down our lives as a project into subsequent projects to climb the ladder of personal success.\nYou can view projects as quests in a video game.\nThis is why video games are enjoyable.\nThey narrow your mind on a hierarchy of goals.\nYou begin to control your attention.\nYou move with purpose through the world.\nPeople notice it in how you hold yourself.\nYou walk down the road with confidence because there aren\u2019t any thoughts that cloud over your authentic state of being.\nOne Hour Of Focused Work\nYou don\u2019t need 12 hours a day to actualize your dreams.\nIf that were the case, nobody would see any form of success.\nAdults have responsibilities.\nFamilies, jobs, and bills to pay require their focus until those problems are solved.\nFor your first meaningful project, pick one that solves the most prevalent problem in your life.\nThis is your purpose.\nSit with it, contemplate, and create a plan of attack.\nAre you overweight?\nAre you broke?\nAre you stressed all the time?\nDo you hate your job?\nDo you lack energy?\nWhat is it?\nWhat are you sweeping under the rug so you don\u2019t have to face the pain that comes with growth?\nIf solved, what problem would unlock the next level of life enjoyment for you?\nFrom there, you must deconstruct that goal into actions that you can incorporate into your lifestyle.\nYour life must change on a fundamental level.\nYou will have to sacrifice what you are currently doing \u2013 because if you want growth, you shouldn\u2019t be doing what you are doing in the first place.\nIf you don\u2019t do it every day, it\u2019s not a habit.\nIf it\u2019s not a habit, the results are temporary.\nHabit formation requires you to change a part of who you are.\nIf you need money, dedicate the first hour of your day to education and action around money.\nIf you want to lose weight, dedicate the first hour of your day to education and action around fitness.\nIf you want to decrease stress, dedicate the first hour of your day to education and action around mental health.\nOne Day At A Time\nFocus is a currency.\nWhen you invest it in your own education, work, rest, and success the results won\u2019t be immediate.\nConsistency is a requirement.\nActually, scratch that, consistency is overrated.\nPersistence and iteration are the requirements.\nYou must show up every day with the intention to build a project that lives into the future.\nThis is how you become a confident and interesting person.\nWhen you are hellbent on creating your vision, people notice.\nAs a leader, you attract followers.\nThey give you the resources to build faster.\nPeople adopt your perspective and their lives improve.\nOf course, there will be people trying to pull you down, but they are few and far between. You will learn to manage and ignore them.\nHow do you make persistent action seamless?\nBy scheduling lever moving tasks into a high energy time block in your day.\n1) Lever Moving Tasks\nAs to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. \u2013 Harrington Emerson\nThe key to persistency is momentum.\nYou need to stack small wins.\nLike a video game.\nWhy would you keep playing the game if you never made any progress? It wouldn\u2019t be fun.\nThis is where other traps come into play.\nToo many people start working without direction or education.\nThey latch onto methods rather than habituating the principles.\nStart with what you know.\nPrioritize big-picture understanding.\nLearn the technical details when you encounter a specific problem.\nIf you want to lose weight, it is foolish to start reading a book on hypothyroidism before learning the principles of training and nutrition.\nIf you want to start a business, it is foolish to buy a course on client acquisition with Facebook ads before learning the principles of traffic and offers.\nIf you want to go on a date, it is foolish to learn \u201cgame\u201d before understanding the principles of social, intimate, or business relationships.\nYou will notice that principles overlap across multiple domains of life. Meaning, you will make holistic progress much faster.\nLike how you can bulk and cut in business.\nOr how you need a valuable offer in front of targeted traffic in dating.\nStart your meaningful project.\nBuy books that are focused on the whole of the subject.\nUnderstand the lever-moving tasks you must complete daily.\n2) High Energy Time Blocks\nFor most, it makes sense to block out your focused work first thing in the morning.\nEspecially if you have a job or family.\nYour energy may not seem like it is the \u201chighest,\u201d but you have a limited amount of energy each day.\nAre you going to build your dreams after work?\nI\u2019ve tried it, it\u2019s difficult to be consistent.\nAre you going to build your dreams when you have family obligations clogging your mental space?\nProbably not.\nMake it easy on yourself.\nWake up early for a week.\nPush through the discomfort.\nMake it habit. It won\u2019t be difficult for long.\nYou will grow to enjoy it.\nIf you are young and have few responsibilities, the same applies.\nYou can work whenever you want, but realize the distractions in your life.\nDistractions are subjective.\nI\u2019m not saying your friends and video games are bad.\nBut in relation to your dreams, they will prevent your progress.\nWork in the morning.\nKnock out your priority tasks.\nEnjoy the rest of your day at ease because you have already done what you need to do.\nThat\u2019s it for this letter.\nHave a great weekend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "The Koe Letter\nJune 24, 2023\nLength: 4000 words\nRead time: 15 minutes\nWhen I first started out in business, I had no idea what I was doing.\nI thought it was obvious, especially freelancing:\nIf I have a skill, people need that skill, so they will hire me.\nI was ignorant to the fact that anybody could learn that skill (and the online freelancing arena was starting to become flooded with single-skill commodities like web design).\nThat was the first problem I had to solve.\nTo cut to the chase, I bought courses on:\nFreelancing\nFacebook ads\ne-Commerce brand building\nCopywriting\nSales and client acquisition\nAt least 15 web development courses that are irrelevant, but noteworthy\nI didn\u2019t see much success when I tried to build the business they were teaching in those courses (that\u2019s on me, not them)\u2026\nBut I noticed a few patterns between them all.\nOne was very apparent:\nI had to get very specific with who I was targeting.\nI had to niche down.\nI had to identify a starving market (like health).\nBreak that down into sub-markets (like bodybuilding).\nNarrow in on a niche market (like minimalist training).\nResearch the people within that market and collect data on them. That way, I could hit their pain points and speak to them directly.\nIt all made so much sense!\nThis was it.\nI knew I had to find a specific person and tailor my skill set to them in the form of a product or service.\nThis was the secret I was missing!\nJust niche down bro! That\u2019s all there is to it!\nThis is still the most common advice that you will hear in the online space.\nAnd it still sparks the most confusion, overwhelm, and anxiety in beginners.\nThey feel like if they don\u2019t have the most profitable niche from the start, they will fail.\nSo they spend their time:\nFlopping from niche to niche\nLearning skills for that niche (not a bad thing)\nEnd up with no money or leverage to show for it (a bad thing)\nI like to challenge common beliefs (in more than just business) because most of the time they are accepted as law without question.\nThey get some \u2013 but not the best \u2013 results so people flock to them, hide behind them, and lash out at anyone who says there is a better way.\nBusiness education is much like politics or religion and people would be better off if they could become aware of the dangers that come with ideology.\nThe business world has changed drastically with the rise of social media.\nThere is a significant difference between a business model that relies on cold outbound outreach rather than building an audience that warms up and become customers with time.\nMost of the things you will learn on the internet are outdated and are not the best way of doing business in the new economy.\nThis letter is going to be long.\nWe will dive into a metaphysical explanation of reality.\nThis is important, but if you want to skip to the practical steps, we talk about:\nTreating the evolution of your brand as an actualization hierarchy (so you don\u2019t have to niche down)\nHow to build each level of your brand from beginner to advanced\nPractical things to build at each level \u2013 so you know what to do right now\nIn the last section, You Are The Infinite Niche.\nThe Mindset Shift That Led To You Reading This Letter\nI don\u2019t know how or why, but I was scrolling Twitter.\nI had just re-downloaded it after it was deleted from my phone for 8 years.\nA tweet caught my eye.\nIt was a guy both selling web design services and dishing out self-development advice at the same time.\nI was conditioned into the mind that I had to cold call, cold email, and run ads in order to see any form of business success.\nAfter years of trial and error, I never saw the kind of success that I wanted to see. I could have stuck it out, but I never would have made it as one person.\nWhen I saw people posting content (around things that I knew I could talk about as well) and landing clients from it\u2026 things started to click.\nWith cold email and DMs:\nNobody knew who I was\nThere wasn\u2019t any prior trust\nI didn\u2019t have a way of showing my authority or results from the start \u2013 I had to prove myself\nAs one person, it\u2019s a lot of manual work if you want the messages to be personal\nEvery pitch I sent either led to a customer or nothing at all. I wasn\u2019t building leverage along the way.\nWith social media content, warm outreach (to your audience), and promotions:\nI create a reputation over time\nI build trust with span and depth (short-form and long-form content)\nI can build trust in my audience without having to explain myself to them\nI can generate interest in my products without trying\nNothing goes to waste. All content either contributes to data (failures) or growth (successes)\nAs I grow larger, I can evolve my brand into something I enjoy doing. I gain, rather than lose, freedom with time.\nSo, I started writing content on Twitter to land clients for my marketing services.\nAnother problem:\nPeople feel like they can only talk about one topic related to what they sell.\nThey don\u2019t realize that:\n1) You are interested in the topic related to what you sell, obviously.\n2) You also follow 200-500 other people with other interests that are \u201ccompletely different.\u201d\nHow can you believe that you have to stick to one interest when you are following people that talk about 10-20 different interests?\nIt\u2019s not that people won\u2019t be interested in your other interests.\nIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t know how to make your interests interesting to other people.\nPeople feel like if they go to broad, rather than niche, they will dilute themselves to the point of not making any money.\nI called bullshit on this early.\nEvery single big YouTuber, podcaster, or other pseudo-celebrity is broad. Go look at Iman Ghadzi or Hamza.\nThey focus on beginner-level education on top-of-funnel social media.\nThey focus on intermediate to advanced in their low-ticket to high-ticket products and services.\nThey are somewhat holistic in the things they talk about. They understand that business or self-improvement demands that health and lifestyle be talked about.\nThey are far ahead of the curve because they understand human nature.\nThink of it like this:\nMost brands are a building within a community in the world of social media.\nI want my brand to be a community in the world of social media. My newsletters, lead magnets, and products are the buildings, or digital real estate.\nBut, you clearly have to establish a building first, then expand.\nHuman nature is the can of worms we will attempt to open now.\nStages Of Development, Natural Hierarchies, & How They Reflect In The Creator Economy\nLet\u2019s begin by understanding hierarchies and developmental stages.\nHierarchies are the foundation of existence.\nYes\u2026 even those that think hierarchies are bad are still ranking hierarchies as bad, which is a hierarchy within itself.\nThe fabric of reality is composed of units of mind.\nThis is a concept that is foundational in my new book The Art Of Focus (updates coming soon).\nOthers have coined this term as \u201cholons\u201d or \u201cunits of thought\u201d as Alan Watts likes to put it.\nI prefer units of mind because of the philosophy of mentalism \u2013 or that All is Mind.\nDuring animal life, or before the emergence of human consciousness, there was no mind to label, interpret, and create language so that everyone could be on the same page.\nWe had to make sense of reality.\nThese \u201cunits\u201d of mind are everything.\nEvery single thing you can label or perceive.\nThere are a few distinct characteristics to them:\n1) Units of mind are hierarchical and intimately connected with the rest of the world.\nLike an atom to cell to molecule.\nOr a letter to sentence to paragraph to book.\nOr content to product to brand to community to social media.\nOr short-form content to medium-form to long-form.\nBeyond that, any of those units are vertically or horizontally connected to everything by a proximal relationship.\nLike how short-form content on the topic of bodybuilding connects to the gym to your nutrition to your kitchen to the fork in your hand to the micro-ecosystem in your gut.\n2) Units of mind are whole parts. Both a whole in themself and a part of something greater.\nA whole of a personal brand is nothing without its parts, and most people neglect the need for each part in order to evolve.\nDominator hierarchies \u2013 the ones that give \u201chierarchies\u201d a bad reputation and make people want to \u201cdismantle\u201d the patriarchy \u2013 are classified when a unit within the hierarchy attempts to dominate.\nLike how a cancer cell will replicate in the body\u2026 until it kills the host, or hierarchy, by destroying a lower level that allows the whole of the hierarchy to exist.\nThe cancer cell must be healed and reintegrated into the hierarchy for it to continue healthy growth.\n3) With that, units of mind emerge, transcend, and include.\nBy nature, fewer creators will reach the highest level of the hierarchy. There can only be so many creators with millions of followers.\nBut, the amount of creators with 100,000 followers \u2013 which is more than enough to make more money than you can fathom \u2013 is growing by the day.\nAs the creator economy continues to evolve, new levels of the hierarchies that compose it will emerge as new wholes that transcend its parts.\nWe must also take into account that you do not need a digital product business or a following to earn an income.\nPeople can refer you to gigs, you can create a physical product, or you can land big opportunities.\nBut the underlying principles remain if you want to make this a possibility for yourself: brand, content, value (or offer), and marketing (or promotion).\nYou cannot receive from the creator economy if you do not contribute.\nYou are a whole in a part of your network, which is a part of a community, which is a part of the creator economy, which is a part of the internet and beyond.\nYou must exchange value if you want to survive.\nUnderstanding Your Personal Evolution\nEverything goes through developmental stages.\nEven your personal brand.\nI\u2019ve written about this in-depth in The One Person Business roadmap.\nWithout overcomplicating this and writing a book on stages of ego development and spiral dynamics, let\u2019s simplify this with two examples:\n1) Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced\nAt each stage of the creator journey, you will have to prioritize different things.\nBeginners won\u2019t have validated ideas.\nThey won\u2019t have a developed brand (or personal) philosophy because you can only find that through years of writing and reflection.\nThey also won\u2019t have the leverage necessary to focus on what brings exponential results (newsletter, YouTube, digital products, etc).\nThe point is, you will have to cultivate social media as a skill just like everyone else. You will have to prioritize your learning and action around whatever level of the game you are in.\n2) Pre-rational, Rational, & Post-Rational\nThis developmental progression is best illustrated by the notorious bell-curve meme:\nWhen people first start to develop themselves in any area of life, they latch on to specific teachings and principles of related ideologies.\nIf they don\u2019t continue to evolve, they can get trapped in that phase.\nLike how religious people become \u201cbible thumpers\u201d and regurgitate everything they\u2019ve learned without questioning or understanding.\nThen, they reach the intermediate or rational stage.\nThis is where people start to question and rebel against the beginner stage.\nIn the spiritual domain of development, this is where atheists come into play.\nIn the creator domain of development, this is where people get bitter at the game (I\u2019ve been seeing this a lot on Twitter lately. The market is going through a cycle of calling people out and complaining about how the game is unfair).\n\u201cEveryone is a copycat.\u201d\n\u201cCoaches selling to coaches are running a pyramid scheme.\u201d (Lack of understanding of hierarchies).\n\u201cHigh ticket sales is the best business model because everyone else is basic and not as smart as me. It\u2019s also my way of survival so I\u2019m deeply tied to it or else I feel threatened\u201d\nAgain, this can get dangerous.\nLastly, you evolve to the advanced or post-rational stage.\nIn this stage, you rediscover the principles and can approach them from a place of experience.\nLike how most developed spiritual people agree and embody the principles in the bible (and every other pattern across all belief systems that point to truth because they are not limited by cultural understanding), but they see the futility in preaching it as the one and only ideology (or else you burn in hell!)\nIn the creator economy, we can note a few things.\nMany intermediates despise simple platitudes or cliches. They enter a bitter phase where they try to rebel against the nature of business.\n(Which is good, but like a replicating cancer cell, you must take your discoveries and be reintegrated into the hierarchy to advance to the next stage \u2013 or else you destroy your business like I\u2019ve seen time and time again).\nAdvanced creators see them as a pillar in their growth, but from the perspective of experience and authority, or else the simple quote-like content doesn\u2019t have impact.\nWith that long background, we can now come to \u201ccreating your niche\u201d from a place of metaphysical understanding.\nYou Are The Infinite Niche\nI\u2019ve discussed how \u201cyou are the most profitable niche\u201d a few times in the past, notably in this letter.\nSo this letter doesn\u2019t end up at 5000 words (it still might):\nYour brand vision is your vision for the future, this is what you are leading your followers toward.\nYour brand identity is your story. Where you came from and how you transformed.\nYour content illustrates this by educating on the skills and interests you learned to get to where you are.\nYour thoughts, opinions, and worldview are how you position your content in a unique way.\nYour products are the systems you\u2019ve created to help those behind you.\nLet\u2019s build on this idea by going deeper.\nHopefully, this provides clarity:\nDon\u2019t Niche Down \u2013 View Your Brand As An Actualization Hierarchy\nYou are complex.\nWell, at least that should be your aim.\nThe Universe evolves toward complexity, as does your sense of self as you learn, implement, and understand.\nThe complexity of your character is determined by the goals or challenges you\u2019ve pushed through.\nEach goal you achieve requires a certain skill level and perspective to match.\nOnce you achieve that goal, a new path unlocks so that you can work towards the next.\nThe higher your skill level (across multiple domains), the higher your complexity of self.\nAs you increase in complexity, you can solve deeper, more meaningful problems in your life and the lives of others.\nAnd if you are the niche, your brand should grow in similar complexity as your skills and interests evolve in the pursuit of your goals.\nAs you learn and acquire skills, it is your duty to build real-world projects that get results for other people.\nThat is both how you create a profitable product in business and fulfill your spiritual duty.\nWith every level of development you reach, you will build a tangible product to reflect that. This is how you educate your followers and build authority.\nAfter I solved a productivity problem in my life, I created a Power Planner which is now a lead magnet of mine.\nAfter I got results with web design and freelancing, I created a course for each (this only furthered my understanding of those things, teaching is how you learn more).\nAfter I acquired a skill stack, I created a brand consulting offer to start helping others.\nNow, what many people miss when it comes to niching down is this:\nThey don\u2019t realize that any newsletter, lead magnet, product, or service you create IS AN AUDIENCE.\nYou are building an audience off platform.\nThe problem:\nMost people are afraid to create and publish anything.\nThey don\u2019t realize that long-form content, products, and services are the backbone of your entire brand.\nI don\u2019t want to sound egotistical, but this example illustrates it well.\n\u201cDan, how do you keep such high engagement when all of my Twitter clients are going to zero?\u201d\nHmmm I wonder why\u2026 because I don\u2019t treat my brand as something that can be built by someone else. Or something that can be systemized into the ground with templated content.\nBecause I\u2019ve cultivated depth in my content, have thousands of students, and hundreds of thousands of people that have read my newsletter and downloaded my free products.\nPeople read my content from a place of understanding who I am and my philosophy.\nI\u2019ve been talking about this for years but people glance over it because short-form content and shallow products is the easy route.\nMy brand is my vessel for my life\u2019s work.\nMy brand is a brand, not a niche audience.\nIt is a city within social media. A community of millions of people.\nMy Power Planner has a 70,000 downloader niche audience around productivity. This is digital real estate I am occupying.\nMy newsletter has a 120,000 subscriber niche audience around depth, philosophy, and business.\nMy products have a 15,000+ student niche audience around writing, branding, and business.\nWhen you niche down your brand, I see people maybe get to 100,000 total followers after 3 years.\nMy Power Planner is more of a niche audience than that, and it has 70,000 people there.\nDo you see what I\u2019m getting at?\nThis is how you remove the boundaries around who you are and build whatever the f*ck you want (with time).\nEveryone Starts On Level One\nNow, of course, you won\u2019t be able to just build all of these things in the blink of an eye.\nThese are stages of development we are talking about here.\nYou have to set your mind on building the first level of your pyramid.\nOnce that project emerges, transcend to the next level and include the prior.\nMost people never evolve because they stop building.\nAnd because they stop building, they stop learning.\nYou don\u2019t learn if you don\u2019t have something to apply what you learn to, it\u2019s just mental masturbation at that point.\nLesson:\nIf you don\u2019t build digital real estate under your brand, you will be trapped in that shallow level of development.\nYou will continue competing against those at that level.\nFor most people, that means writing content, landing clients, and getting stuck in the feast or famine service business cycle.\nThe Smart Progression For Authority & Growth\nHere\u2019s what I would recommend as a beginner progression.\nThis is what I would do if I could go back and optimize what I build.\n1) Determine The 2-3 Topics That Lead To Your Vision\nIdentify what you want in life, the thing that you are leading your followers toward.\nYour skills and interests are how you, uniquely, will get there.\nLike how someone that wants to be free can start an e-commerce business, while the other can practice budgeting techniques, while the other becomes a digital nomad from side hustles.\nI\u2019ve broken this in-depth in my how to write social media content letter.\n2) Practice Top Of Funnel Writing & Growth\nYour number one priority is consistent brand growth on social media.\nThe \u201ceasiest\u201d ones to grow big on are Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other short-form platforms. You are in more control of your growth.\nYou want to build a base audience where you can fuel your digital real estate, products, and services over time.\nAs your audience grows, your leverage to build and talk about whatever you want does with it.\nBuy best-selling books on your topics and devour them.\nFollow social media accounts that talk about those topics and emulate them from the lens of a creator, not consumer.\nPay attention to what writing, ideas, and structures perform the best.\nThat is how you practice writing.\nYours will suck at first.\nGet it out of the way while nobody is watching.\n3) Start A Newsletter As A Vessel To Build Projects\nI always recommend starting a newsletter.\nYou don\u2019t have to start writing it on a consistent basis.\nYou can build a subscriber base until you are ready to be consistent.\nPeople procrastinate building a newsletter because it is a long-term game. You don\u2019t see immediate results.\nThe benefits of starting a newsletter are:\nYou can practice developing depth behind your ideas. This leads to original thought and struggle with writing. You get better faster.\nYou can use it as a place to write modules or sections of your lead magnet or products. No, it doesn\u2019t matter if you send it out free at first.\nYou show that you are providing value off platform as a beginner, which helps with perceived authority (\u201cselling\u201d something helps your brand, not selling something hurts it).\nWhenever you create something in the next steps, use your newsletter to write the first iteration of the sections.\n4) Create A Lead Magnet As Your First \u201cNiche\u201d\nI\u2019ve built and tested 8-10 lead magnets.\nFrom how to create a basic website to the basics of marketing to the power planner to my idea generation system.\nPeople with a \u201cniche\u201d brand have to consistently talk about the one topic they are niched down into.\nLet\u2019s take video editing as an example (this applies to every other interest. Health, nutrition, marketing skills, philosophy, anything.)\nIf I create a lead magnet on the basics of video editing, do I have to always worry about writing about only that?\nOr can I write whatever I want and just plug my lead magnet?\nEspecially when my lead magnet has my best thoughts and articulation of the subject matter.\nAnd, I build my newsletter along the way.\nExamples of lead magnet ideas:\nChecklists to get results (like a web design checklist)\nNotion templates for systems (like writing or habit formation)\nBeginner-level ebook that goes over the fundamentals to get people up to speed with more advanced stuff you talk about.\nVideo tutorials or screen recordings of the same beginner fundamentals.\nCreate a lead magnet to establish authority in the topic you want to monetize, or at least think you want to monetize. You can always create another one.\nOver time, you will build a niche audience of downloaders.\n5) Sell A Minimum Viable Service Offer To Gain Experience\nYou need a \u201cnext step\u201d for lead magnet downloaders.\nHopefully, something you can monetize.\nFor beginners, I recommend a minimum viable offer.\nThat means a single-skill freelance service (like web design) or a single interest coaching service (like productivity or health).\nI\u2019ve discussed this before in it\u2019s own letter (The Best Online Business Model).\nCharge $500-$1000 until you understand what will get true results.\nSystemize it.\nCharge more.\nReplace your income with 3-4 clients a month and go full-time.\n6) De-niche, Evolve, Transcend, Include\nAt this point, you have developed authority in one niche.\nYou should spend some time getting results in this area while testing different interests in your content.\nTo deepen your authority and open up room to explore new interests, you should complete your brand actualization pyramid.\nTurn your freelance or consulting service into a cohort-based course. Get results at this level.\nProductize that cohort into a digital product. Get results at this level.\nRepeat the process of lead magnet, service, cohort, and product until you have a holistic synthesis of content, products, and services.\nIf you want to talk about certain interests, you need foundational content (like a lead magnet or newsletter) in place to get people up to speed.\nIf you aren\u2019t getting engagement when talking about a new interest, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t developed depth under it.\nYou need to get your audience on the same page of understanding.\nHolistic Synthesis Of Skills & Interests\nWith time and effort, let\u2019s say 1-2 years, you can really begin to do whatever you want.\nThe world needs more holistic synthesizers because reality is not compartmentalized like the current school system.\nYou may not see it now, but you are creating society.\nYour job is to note patterns between interests and industries.\nBridge them together in your creations.\nBecome a modern polymath.\nA digital renaissance man.\nExplore reality through your interests.\nDistribute your discoveries through content.\nMake a living doing what you love by creating something worth charging for.\nFlow with the direction of the Universe and bask in the enjoyment that comes with it.\nAnd, enjoy the rest of your weekend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "A new society has emerged.\nA virtual one.\nWe all thought that a \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was a few years out from existence and that it would be composed of technology like Apple\u2019s new VR headset.\nBut that\u2019s not how evolution works.\nEvolution is about solving problems that cause our suffering.\nIt is a slow burn.\nThe emergence of this new society was fast like an exploding star. We called it social media.\nThere were burning problems in human life that led to programmers, visionaries, and businessmen building a mass solution.\nCommunication was local.\nInformation was local.\nBusiness was local.\nOpportunities were local.\nCenturies of geographic restriction changed in the blink of an eye.\nThe internet allowed for the emergence of social media.\nSocial media allowed for the emergence of the creator economy.\nThe creator economy allowed for the advancement of decentralization.\nThe Industrial Revolution caused an unsustainable development of dominator hierarchies \u2013 more power and less people at the top, less power with more people at the bottom.\nThe Age of Information began to reverse this effect with the development of creator actualization hierarchies.\nCreators educate, entertain, and inspire those beneath them with content and courses \u2013 but there is nothing holding any individual back from advancing to the top of the ladder.\nLet\u2019s deconstruct this a bit:\nWhat Is The Creator Society?\nWith the development of the internet, information has spread beyond measure.\nThis led to the development of a more advanced, global, and accessible society.\nSocieties consist of institutions, and communities with shared beliefs, and cultural ideas.\nThe most notable aspects are the school system, workforce, social and business tribes, and religious establishments.\nSocial media has expanded and collapsed the lines between these.\nEverything is becoming more holistic and interconnected like rain to the ocean as the pattern of Universal division and unity hints at.\nThe public school system had many problems:\nConvergent thinking\nCompartmentalized learning\nConformity over authenticity\nMemorization over process\nFailure as something to avoid\nAuthorities as unquestionable\nLong work over efficiency and true value\nIntelligence defined by book smarts\nDecade-old curriculums that only worry about training you into a replaceable job\nThe new school system in the creator society allows individuals to:\nPursue their curiosity\nFind teachers (creators) that they learn best from\nTreat learning as a part of life rather than an annoying obligation\nLearn modern skills that allow you to adapt fast to the fast-changing environment\nFind specific knowledge that contributes to their pursuit of self-generated (rather than assigned) goals\nPrioritize entrepreneurship as it is the only logical end goal for those that want more out of life\nThe new school system is internet content. None of this is labeled. It is just a part of virtual life.\nThe religious establishments narrowed the minds of its followers and fought any perspective that contradicted their own.\nNow, spiritual awareness and education are accessible in most creator brands.\nYou can open your mind, study different perspectives, and self-experiment until you cultivate a philosophy that suits you.\nThis is not only for spiritual growth, but mental, financial, and health-related.\nWhat Is The Creator Economy?\nThe exchange of goods has been a natural part of society since the inception of human interaction.\nValue creation and exchange are the foundation of communication and relationships. Humans are deeply social creatures.\nMoney, or currency, is a neutral form of value.\nIndividuals spend it on what they perceive as valuable.\nWhat they perceive as valuable is dependent on their identity, perspective, goals, current state of mind, and level of awareness of their problems.\nWe can start to see the importance of marketing and sales \u2013 as they are the main skills for illustrating the value you have to offer.\nMarketing and sales take everything above into account.\nIf you don\u2019t position a product or service to a specific person (identity) with a specific goal that implies a specific problem, you won\u2019t make money.\nThe Creator Economy is composed of individuals distributing value in the form of content and products.\nThey educate their audience on the skills and interests that will aid in the actualization of their goals.\nTheir products or services are meant to generate results and move them faster toward those goals.\nMy One-Person Business Philosophy\nThere are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies. \u2013 Naval\nThe best businesses change lives.\nAnd transformations make a winning product.\nStop trying to solve imaginary problems.\nSolve your problems.\nChange your own life.\nPackage up the method.\nSlap a price tag on it.\nYou\u2019re less likely to fail if you solve real, meaningful problems.\nThis is the problem with most people entering business.\nThey don\u2019t have an understanding of marketing, sales, psychology, or evolution in general.\nStop trying to land on Saturn or build a billion-dollar tech company when a majority of the population is suffering from low-consciousness problems (that are holding the collective ego back from enlightenment).\nStart as a micro education business that helps people solve the real problems in their life.\nThat is how you contribute to the happiness and evolution of humanity.\nYou do this by understanding the eternal markets: health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nBy solving your own problems in these domains, you:\nPush toward your own self-actualization\nCreate a unique map with your own story that you can pass down\nMake an income by helping others heal and achieve their goals\nFrom there, everyone is at a higher state of consciousness.\nWe can then do what we love with our time and solve deeper problems that we are passionate about (like landing on Saturn).\nThe Path To Self-Monetization\nSocial media is a new society.\nPersonal brands are the \u201cpeople\u201d of that society.\nAnd no, this is not limited to people that have a business.\nCreators large and small are hiring left and right.\nBrands and corporations are hiring those that display their value in public.\nSocial media is a public job board, public school, public note-taking system, and public party where you can find friends and nurture business relationships.\nTo start, you can work for another creator to gain experience in the new society. This is a great option, but you can also go straight into building your own thing.\nPath 1) Learn A Skill, Sell A Skill\nThis is what most people recommend you do to start making money fast:\nLearn a modern skill that creators or brands use in their business (like email marketing, funnel design, or content writing)\nCreate content based around that skill to flex your knowledge (frankly, this won\u2019t gain many followers. Your profile will be more like a resume).\nCharge higher prices for a freelance or consulting service because you don\u2019t have the audience to sell a product in your sleep.\nFor any of this to work, you will have to learn the evergreen skills: writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.\nPath 2) Become A Value Creator Around Your Interests\nThis is difficult to articulate, because the most common problem is, \u201cI don\u2019t have any interests.\u201d\nSo let\u2019s start there.\nYou create interest in a topic by investing energy in a goal.\nThat way you feel as if you are wasting your investment if you don\u2019t achieve it. The pressure holds you accountable.\nTrue goals are based on the eternal markets in pursuit of self-actualization.\nThe interests you learn along the way are applied to the achievement of that goal.\nFor the health market, I can become interested in sub-topics of nutrition, training, and mental health:\nBodybuilding\nThe ancestral diet\nMinimalist training\nYoga\nMindfulness\nFor the wealth market, I can become interested in sub-topics of business, career development, and finance:\nFreelancing\nSoftware as a service\nResume building\nInterview preparation\nBudgeting\nAny skill listed in the previous section\nFor the relationships market, I can become interested in sub-topics of social dynamics, dating, and marriage:\nCouples therapy\nConfidence and charisma\nDay game\nHow to approach\nAll help me push toward the development of each area. This is how you become a modern Renaissance man.\nYou must become a lifelong autodidact (self-learner) if you want to be truly irreplaceable.\nYou can learn anything in record time thanks to internet content, courses, and unconventional schooling in the new society.\nPath 3) Do Both For Maximum Effect\nWith a personal brand, you will be forced to learn most modern skills to make it a success.\nYou will have to build your own landing pages, funnels, emails, content, profile design, graphics, and the rest to make your brand a success.\nIf it doesn\u2019t help your brand grow, it won\u2019t help others, and it isn\u2019t worth learning in this case.\nWhen you get results for your own brand, you then have the knowledge to help others with theirs.\nThe product or service you will sell (to practice your skill development) will be based on your interests.\nYou will create a minimum viable offer around those interests with a freelance or consulting service.\nAs you grow your audience with the content you produce, you can eventually turn that into a product that sells with less effort.\nThis is a longer path, but oh so worth it.\nYou drastically improve yourself, and your business has more leverage than most out there.\nThe 4 Pillars Of A 6-Figure One-Person Business\nThe one-person business model can have many definitions.\nAnd now that I have a small team, I can\u2019t really call myself a \u201cone-person business,\u201d but I\u2019m going to redefine it so that I can (lol).\nOn top of that, I pushed a bit too far into a business model I don\u2019t care for. I am actively working to get back to one person and maybe a VA. I\u2019m okay with the decrease in income that comes from that.\nI\u2019ve realized what I want (writing and creative challenges) which allows me to ruthlessly eliminate what stands in the way (with time).\nThe one-person business model is turning yourself into the business.\nIt is a novel and attention-grabbing way of saying, \u201cBecome high-value and put yourself out there until enough people know who you are, what you do, and why you do it. Opportunities will compound.\u201d\nIn a nutshell, that\u2019s all you really need to do to succeed.\nFor clarity, let\u2019s dive into the 4 pillars of the one-person business:\nBrand \u2013 You Are The Niche\nYour personal brand is your \u201cself\u201d or \u201cidentity\u201d in the new society.\nYour identity is the underlying story that shapes your perspective.\nYour perspective contains goals from which you perceive situations.\nThese goals can be assigned to you (social conditioning) or self-generated (in alignment with your vision).\nWhen you read a book, you will interpret it differently from the next person, because you have different goals as your lens.\nIf I read the book Awareness at a low financial point in my life, I will absorb ideas related to reaching my financial vision (that I can distribute in my content).\nAnother person that reads the book at a high relationship point in their life, they may get nothing from it, or absorb ideas to aid in the nurturing of that relationship.\nYour brand is your vision for the future (and you vision evolves as you do).\nYour vision for the future implies that you have, or are learning, the skills and interests necessary to achieve it.\nYour job is to illustrate this wherever a reader can come in contact with you. All of your content will be written from the lens of your brand.\nIf my current vision / goal / purpose is to make more money\u2026\nAnd the skills I\u2019ve learned or am learning are marketing, health, and spirituality\u2026\nMy bio would be, \u201cI write about marketing, health, and spirituality so you can build a holistic one-person business.\u201d\nYes, even health and spirituality can be framed as a way to help with business. This is where most people get confused about incorporating their interests into a confined niche they feel tied to.\nWhat are you leading people toward?\nThat\u2019s how you attract followers.\nContent \u2013 Documenting Your Mind\nI like to think of social media as a public note-taking system where you jot down:\nWhat you are learning and how it applies to your life\nYour thoughts and opinions on your skills and interests\nThe lessons you are learning throughout the story of life\nWithout knowing it, we are actively building out the collective consciousness in an explorable fashion on the internet.\nBut, you can\u2019t just write things out and pray that you grow your brand.\nYou have to study marketing, and persuasion, and immerse yourself in content that does well so you can note the patterns between them all.\nI would recommend the free course on the Digital Economics landing page \u2013 you just enter your email at the top of the page.\nIf you haven\u2019t learned marketing, sales, or copywriting \u2013 start now. They will change your life. And there is too much to go over in this letter about them (double and I\u2019ve talked about them multiple times before, this letter is a good starting point).\nProduct \u2013 Public Personal Projects\nUnder the one-person business philosophy, you contribute to the new society by solving your own problems and selling the solution.\nHere\u2019s the progression:\nIdentify a problem in your life\nTurn it into a personal project for experience\nTurn it into a minimum viable offer\nStart selling for $500-$1000 (freelancing or consulting)\nBuild your audience along the way with content\nIncrease the depth and complexity of your offer\nProductize it when you feel ready so it can sell in your sleep\nThis will take 1-3 years.\nIf your goal is to make more money in business or your career, you can learn a skill like email marketing.\nIf your goal is to get ripped and increase your attraction & confidence, you can go to the gym and fix your nutrition.\nOnce you do, you can begin selling it as a freelance or consulting service.\nWith the email marketing example, freelance is the obvious option.\nTeaching others often gets swept under the rug.\nYou can teach other creators or brands what you\u2019ve learned in your email marketing pursuits \u2013 especially if you applied it to your own brand and saw results along the way.\nWhere does a \u201cproject\u201d come into play?\nProjects are how you actually solve your problems in the real world.\nThey force you to apply what you learn.\nThey are also tangible, they are your result.\nYou can iterate on them and get better with time.\nYou can reflect on them and make it easier to achieve for the next person.\nWith email marketing, write an email sequence for your own brand. You can practice selling someone else\u2019s product (affiliate), or practice promoting your favorite books or products. Craft a persuasive argument around them.\nThen, do the same thing for your favorite brand. Build them an email sequence.\nNow that you have real-world practice, you can either pitch your services to that brand, or start helping others build their own out.\nTeaching is how you identify knowledge gaps.\nThat is the only way you will be able to fill them.\nBy not building projects and teaching what you learn, your journey will be slow and painful.\nMarketing \u2013 Sell To Yourself\nYou won\u2019t make a single penny if you never promote yourself.\nSimple as that.\nPeople ask me (from a state of stress, overwhelm, and panic) why they aren\u2019t making money from their efforts.\nIt\u2019s because they do everything but promote their products or services.\nMarketing exists across the entirety of your brand but is most prevalent in:\nYour landing pages for your products and services\nYour emails where you promote them\nYour content where you promote them\nYour outreach messages where you see if others are a fit for them\nAgain, I\u2019ve talked about this all before, and I give my exact systems in Digital Economics, so let\u2019s go over a framework you can practice with.\nIdentify Their Goals or Desired Outcome\nYou have to know what your audience wants.\nMake it top-of-mind by asking them or illustrating what the goal is in your marketing.\nWhen you are the niche, this is a goal that you\u2019ve already achieved. You should already know what is desirable to your audience through self-reflection.\nIdentify What Is Standing In The Way\nWhat is the reason people aren\u2019t achieving their goals?\nWhat is the reason you didn\u2019t achieve the goal at the start?\nWrite it out in your promotions or ask the person you are talking to in your outreach messages.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s preventing you from achieving [the goal they mentioned]?\u201d\nPresent Your Solution To Solve A Burning Problem\nNow that they are clear on the goal and what is standing in the way, you know whether or not they are a fit for your solution.\nIf they aren\u2019t, wish them a good day and leave them alone.\nIf they are, ask them how their life would be impacted if they could achieve that goal \u2013 this shines a light on the problem they are facing.\nFrom here, you can present your offer as a potential solution.\nTo practice this process more as a beginner, read this letter on The Non-Needy Networking Process.\nThat\u2019s all you need to know about the one-person business model for now.\nFeel free to watch through the rest of The One Person Business playlist on my YouTube.\nEnjoy the rest of your day.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

So I made that my priority project each morning for a year.\n(By the way, if you can\u2019t tell, this is mainly for internet entrepreneurs and creatives.)\n2) I\u2019ve always focused on the highest leverage activities possible.\nFreelance and consulting work is a great starting point but demands a lot of time.\nIf you want more freedom, you need a product that can sell in your sleep, without personal effort.\nWith time I transitioned out of client work and used my results in brand advising to create a digital product stack.\nThe time-to-money ratio must decrease as you grow.\nNext, I realized that writing was my ideal traffic generation method.\nI write for 1-2 hours every single morning.\nYes, even on weekends.\nNo, I don\u2019t want to do anything else with that time.\nMy writing gets repurposed to every single social media platform so that my audience continues to grow.\nThis is where most people fail.\nThey take courses, which illustrate exactly what the high-leverage tasks are, but then do the exact opposite.\nWhen they ask, \u201cDan, why am I not getting results?\u201d\nI ask what they are doing on a daily, focused basis and it is close to nothing.\nThey are not performing the actions that get results on a daily basis.\nThey are procrastinating for 3 hours and doing things that don\u2019t matter for another 8.\nResults take time to build momentum and most people aren\u2019t patient.\n3) People still don\u2019t realize the compounding nature of readership growth.\nBusiness, online or offline, requires people and a product.\nPeople come from ads, geographic location (for physical businesses), manual outreach like cold calls or email, or growing a readership through content creation in the new digital society.\nMost businesses spend hours each day attempting to acquire customers.\nThey neglect the power of social media.\nMy creator philosophy:\n\n1) Go large and broad so you can talk about whatever you want.\n\n2) Your newsletter, products, and services create beginner to advanced niche sub-audiences.\n\nA map that guides people through the hierarchy of needs as you self-actualize.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 10, 2023\nMy point being:\nIf a brand with 50,000 followers can make $50,000 a month (yes, this is the low end if you know what you are doing)\u2026\nI can make that much with one-tenth of the effort if I have 500,000 followers.\nNow imagine if I have 2 million (which I do), I can make that much in an hour a week.\nIn other words:\nI can make 10x the amount of most people because of the focus I\u2019ve invested over the years. And I don\u2019t care to work longer for the sake of status and fitting in with other entrepreneurs.\nMe writing one tweet is the same as a beginner writing 10,000 (both in terms of high performing ideas due to practice and the spread of that tweet).\nI know an entrepreneur who works 14 hrs a day\n\nAnd is stuck living in the basement\n\nI know an entrepreneur who works 5 hrs a day\n\nAnd has built/sold 3 companies for $100m+ each\n\nThe value isn't in how many hours you work\n\nBut where you focus your attention/awareness/consciousness\n\u2014 Tej Dosa (@ComedicBizman) June 9, 2023\nNo other traffic generation holds that power.\nThe harsh reality is that most people don\u2019t stick it out long enough. They never reach the point where they can get a month\u2019s worth of results in one day.\nMost people aren\u2019t increasing their skill level, they are increasing the amount of time they spend at their current skill level.\nI teach this holistic business model in my Digital Economics Masterclass to turn yourself into a business.\nNow, why do I only work 4 hours a day?\nIt seems like more and more young entrepreneurs boast about working all the time.\n12-14 hour days.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this, and I\u2019m sure it can be rather enjoyable. Entrepreneurship is a game. A very fun game at that.\nBut, there\u2019s a glaring problem with that lifestyle.\nOverwork is the antagonist of holistic development, and holism is the catalyst to exponential growth toward self-transcendence.\nPeople wonder why I work 3-4 hours a day (on an average day, nothing is permanent)\u2026\nI wonder why they don\u2019t if they value self-actualization.\nIf you are so focused on something as neutral as money, how do you have time for creativity, relationships, and health?\nThink of a talent tree in a video game.\nYou won\u2019t have access to higher levels of skill development if you only focus on one path.\nYou can push to a certain level in business, but to reach new heights, you have to reach an equal level of development in health, relationships, and cognitive development.\nTo my point above about getting 1 month of results in 1 day, this is close to impossible if you are only focused on business.\n\u201cFocusing on one thing\u201d requires you to focus on a multitude of things to do that one thing better. It\u2019s counterintuitive as most good things in life are.\nThe Psychology (And Futility) Of 9-5 Jobs\nLet\u2019s open this can of worms by making a hard distinction between work and rest.\nWe will classify work as \u201cproductivity mode\u201d and rest as \u201ccreativity mode.\u201d\nBoth are states of mind that are determined by what, how, and why your attention is focused on what it is.\nProductivity Mode\nThis is a narrow focused state of attention.\nYou are fixated on solving a problem that a task presents.\nIt is almost always accompanied by a sense of stress or pressure to perform.\nIn psychology, this is best illustrated by the Task Positive Network in the brain that, \u201cis active during attention-demanding tasks and includes our conscious attention towards the external environment.\u201d\nCreativity Mode\nThis is an open focused state of attention.\nYou do not fixate on a stress-related task, but you can still be focused on a task.\nYou are not actively paying attention.\nThis is why you feel so creative in the shower, at the gym, on a walk, or laying out in the sun.\nIn psychology, this is best illustrated by the Default Mode Network that activates when we shift from outward to inward-focused cognition.\nThe Problem\nOverworkers don\u2019t realize that habits are not only what you do, but who you are.\nA state of mind, like productivity mode, can become conditioned into your mind.\nYou can live in that narrow and stressful perspective in a way that silently wreaks havoc on your health.\nAnd that\u2019s just the thing\u2026\nYou don\u2019t care.\nWhy?\nBecause that\u2019s all you know.\nYou become more egotistical and selfish simply because you can\u2019t fathom a better way of living.\nYour current level of awareness/consciousness doesn\u2019t allow you to grasp at the higher rung of the ladder because it\u2019s clouded by fog.\nYour life is so mechanical and \u201cknown\u201d that it never crosses your mind that there is an unknown that can benefit you.\nYour identity is threatened at the thought that you could see more progress while working 3-4 hours a day. And you\u2019re fearful of the unknown lifestyle you would be thrown into.\nSo the ego constricts its grip on your way of living and you keep on doing what you were doing.\nThe Evolution\nI\u2019m not saying that productivity mode is bad.\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of the most enjoyable states of mind to be in.\nSecure, certain, and focused so that negative thoughts don\u2019t replicate in your mind.\nThat\u2019s not the problem.\nThe problem is never breaking out of that state to reflect on your past and re-aim toward your future.\nYou never zoom out to see where you are going so you can zoom in and make better choices.\nMost people are zoomed in for life. They wake up one day wondering where they went wrong.\nZoom out.\nIdentify a big goal to gain vision.\nPerceive your daily choices from the lens of that goal.\nMost hard-working entrepreneurs would scoff at the fact that they are the exact same as 9-5ers, but they are.\nThe best way to explain this is with the skill:challenge match:\nChallenge the key to maximum enjoyment (flow state).\nI talk about this in Life Is A Video Game.\nChallenge narrows the mind on a problem standing in the way of a meaningful goal, which is the driver of evolution.\nWe can all feel \u201cthe pull\u201d towards our highest version.\nThis is evolution calling you to live in accordance with nature.\nWhat people don\u2019t realize is this is an ever-evolving way of life.\nStagnation = death.\nIn order to reach new levels of challenge to focus your attention you must:\nNever stop learning to stack new skills and perspectives\nIncrease the complexity of your character to be able to even perceive the challenge\nSolve deeper problems in your life so you don\u2019t get trapped in the superficial\nThis is my gripe with most 9-5s.\nYes, some allow you to progress, but it is a slow grind with an inevitable cap.\nI see 9-5 jobs as a stepping stone.\nThey breed complacency and are dangerous for your psyche.\nChallenge is what makes life fun and interesting.\nIf you halt your personal evolution by never pursuing something more, you lose purpose and fulfillment.\nNow, of course, people have their own goals.\nPeople can achieve a sustained level of happiness at a lifelong 9-5 and mindfulness methods.\nBut I am not speaking to those people.\nI am speaking to you.\nA person who clearly has a thirst for more.\nAn innate curiosity to discover your potential.\nOr else you wouldn\u2019t be reading this.\nCreativity & Leverage\nIf the work doesn\u2019t require creativity, delegate it, automate it, or leave it.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) September 30, 2020\nCreativity is the balance to productivity.\nA constant need to be productive leads to a constant level of stress.\nA constant level of stress leads to surface-level living. You don\u2019t even realize there is depth to this life. You have difficulty opening your mind beyond work-related tasks.\nThis impacts every other area of your life.\nYour relationship with your friends and loved ones.\nYour ability to recover from health-related activities.\nYour mental capacity and development (which dictates your future level of true wealth).\n4-hour workdays, singular focus, and meaningful work are becoming the norm in small pockets of the internet, and for good reason.\nAncient Romans and Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an ever-growing list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attribute their success to surprisingly low work times accompanied by an abundance of restful activities like long walks.\nWhen we see someone with a respectable body of creative work, we would expect them to work long hours, obsessing into the night about the details of their next piece.\nInstead, we see the opposite.\nLike Darwin arriving at his study by eight after his morning walk and breakfast.\nHe would work for an hour and a half, take a break to read the mail and write letters, then return to more serious work where he conducted his experiments.\nBy noon Darwin would stop his work day and head out on a long walk.\nAfter reading and answering a few more letters he would take a nap, take another walk, and return to his study for another work block.\n3-5 hours of work paired with active rest seems to be the sweet spot for most impactful creatives.\nWriters from multiple domains like Hemingway, Tarantino, and Ogilvy would spend the majority of their days lounging by the pool, talking to beautiful women, and doing everything aside from what they deemed work.\nThey gave room for the creative emergence of ideas that fueled the impact of their work.\nIf they can change culture and business with their methods, why can\u2019t corporate workaholics do the same?\nIf you\u2019re wondering \u201chow,\u201d to do this, I\u2019ve written about it extensively before.\nHere are my 10 commandments of the 4-hour workday and my deep work routine.\nThe New Currency\nHow do you make money?\nFirst, you need attention.\nSecond, you need a product or service to direct that attention to.\nThird, you need to understand the process of guiding attention throughout that journey.\nSome people may reach your product and buy randomly.\nIn most cases, that is not sustainable.\nYou must create and understand every single touchpoint that a user can come in contact with on your brand.\nSome call this a \u201cfunnel,\u201d but that has negative connotations associated with shady marketers.\nMy funnel is simple:\nWrite a big-idea-centric newsletter every week.\nWrite 3 punchy and memorable tweets every day.\nRepurpose them to all platforms (my newsletter is my YouTube script, I teach you how I write them here).\nYou must capture, hold, and nurture their attention with ideas.\nIdeas are the new currency.\nModern success is mental warfare.\nCreativity, rest, and short work hours are the catalyst.\nThis is something I realized late in my journey.\nHere\u2019s what you need to focus on:\nIf you don\u2019t prioritize depth, you will not be remembered.\nYour authority is determined by how much attention you hold throughout your lifetime.\nA tweet may hold 10 seconds of attention.\nA book holds 5-6 hours of attention.\nYou become what you consume, and you mold those who read your work.\nBooks, newsletters, podcasts, and YouTube videos.\nThese are the foundation of your brand.\nThis is how you nurture an audience without needing pushy sales tactics and direct response marketing.\nWhen you prioritize depth, understanding, and novel perspectives you build trust and equity with your audience that you can cash in when it\u2019s time to promote.\nWho do you remember?\nThe person on Twitter with a tweet you liked?\nOr the author that changed how you move in the world?\nI don\u2019t remember everything I read from Eckhart Tolle, but I will spread his work to anyone curious about who impacted my life the most.\nHe makes money off of me because he lives rent-free in my head.\nThe Fill-Empty-Use Framework For A Holistic Lifestyle\nFill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization\n\nEmpty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation\n\nUse your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 5, 2021\nIn the afternoons, fill your mind through:\nCuriosity pursuit to collect kernels of truth to integrate into your worldview.\nSkill acquisition to increase your value in the marketplace that continues to change. If you stop learning, you die.\nIntellectual conversation so you don\u2019t get trapped in a narrow perspective. You need to test your ideas with an open mind. Avoid debate and argument.\nAll of which can be used as fuel for your creative work.\nIn the afternoons, empty your mind through:\nSelf-reflection to note mistakes, lessons, and directions that you would have missed otherwise.\nReality mapping (or documenting what you learned for the day and how it connects to other ideas) so you can create something of value.\nSpiritual connection so you don\u2019t get trapped in \u201cdoing\u201d mode.

        "content": "The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.\nI\u2019ve begun to understand the difference between \u201crelief\u201d and \u201ccure.\u201d\nRelief feels good.\nIt comes in the form of cheap pleasures, mindless entertainment, and prescriptions.\nHumans fear change.\nSo we cling to the illusion of security that is presented by the external world.\nThe advice.\nThe porn, beyond sex.\nThe promises of a better life.\nThe persuasive marketing angles.\nThe things that may provide a sense of security, but are not of your own understanding.\nA cure is painful.\nIt comes in the form of getting sick of being sick, to the point where you come full circle.\nBy full circle, I mean a complete and radical flip in perception.\nImagine a line colored in a black-to-white gradient with shades of gray in the middle.\nThen, connect the ends of that line together so that black and white touch.\nWe can see this pattern of reality in our everyday life.\nA person so stupid they become insightful.\nAn outfit so unstylish it becomes stylish.\nA joke so unfunny that it becomes funny.\nA non-believer so trapped they become a believer.\nOr, a person so fed up with who they are they become an entirely new person.\nCharacter Begets Action\nIdentity restricts perspective.\nIt provides a boundary so that your thoughts don\u2019t fall into unknown territory and threaten your entire existence.\nPerspective influences perception.\nAny given situation has too much information for the conscious mind to process (we are capable of processing around 50 bits of information per second).\nThe identity, or character, you\u2019ve cultivated with time will limit what information you process that is available to the perspective that you have access to.\nFrom that information, you will interpret it differently from everyone else.\nI can ask you to think of a \u201cbird,\u201d and the image that pops into your head will be different from every other human on this planet.\nSome will think of a cardinal, others a blue jay, both with faint lines forming the image in your head. Yet the underlying essence of what a bird is remains the same.\nThe same is true for something like the concept of God. People go to war over interpretation and \u201cproof\u201d when the experience or essence of what the concept points at is the same, and it\u2019s right in front of you but conditioned thoughts prevent you from seeing beyond the surface.\nSpeaking of something as touchy as God, let\u2019s tie in the example of Christ Consciousness.\nThe identity of Christ was expanded to that of everything that his perspective expanded with it.\nHe could perceive situations holistically and see them for what they are.\nI am not here to lecture you on religion or ideology or dogma because that is the exact opposite of what I am pointing to here. Be careful how your rigid identity influences how you perceive these words (because I\u2019ve been the dude that regurgitates blind \u201cfacts,\u201d judging what I haven\u2019t experienced as if it couldn\u2019t possibly be there).\nI do not subscribe to one perspective, but attempt to integrate truths from all into my worldview. I am nowhere near perfect in this, but it is hard to deny that everyone is pointing at the same thing across every cultural belief system. The meaningful dopamine you reap from pattern recognition in studying different perspectives is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.\nPerception influences how you move within the world.\nPeople that are heavily tied to a religious, nutrition, business, or political ideology will almost always act in alignment with the goals that were assigned to them by that intellectual construct.\nPeople that seek to open their mind to awareness and understanding can make decisions that are conducive to their ideal future.\nAction is directed toward a goal. Always.\nYour identity has goals baked into it.\nThe question is whether or not those goals are self-generated or assigned to you by the external.\nA political ideologue that adopted the beliefs of their parents without question will act toward goals assigned to them by the political party.\nA bodybuilder by passion and self-study will generate their own goals and allow their nutrition, lifestyle, and training to fall in alignment with that goal \u2013 else they experience suffering, which is not bad, but a useful compass toward better.\nCharacter creates action and action reinforces character.\nIf you want to change who you are, challenge your beliefs.\nAllow your actions to follow suit with time (not a day or week or even month, but a lifetime).\nAnd by doing so, you create a life of less involuntary pain.\nThe Most Interesting Part Of A Story\nMost people don\u2019t realize that life is story.\nStory is symbolic of Universal patterns.\nYou can note these patterns in architecture, music, all of creation, scripture, systems, environment, economics, and your life.\nThat is how we make sense of the world.\nThe mind interprets the world through concepts, stories, metaphors, and symbols.\nTo understand one thing, we must have a subconscious understanding of everything it is connected to.\nA cup wouldn\u2019t make sense without a hand.\nGravity wouldn\u2019t make sense without force or mass.\nYour life wouldn\u2019t make sense without the current state of society and culture.\nEverything you know is just a layer of stories containing billions of bits of on/off information pieced together for your current level of understanding.\nStories give meaning to life.\nYour identity is the story you tell yourself.\nYou will live out that story on autopilot if not made conscious.\nWhat word, sentence, paragraph, section, and chapter is unfolding before you in the book that is your life?\nNow, we must bring in the topic of polarity to deepen our understanding of meaning.\nIn short, one thing cannot exist without the other.\nHappiness cannot exist without a sad reference point.\nNor a cup without a hand.\nOr life without suffering.\nOn that last point, the climax of the story is often the most memorable.\nWhen the battle is at its peak.\nWhen you aren\u2019t sure what the future holds.\nWhen the symbolic villain is just about to win but the hero triumphs.\nIf there were no low points in your life it would lose all meaning.\nIt would become flat. Dull. Linear. Lifeless. Mechanical. Robotic. Mindless. Mediocre.\nLife is a dance between order and chaos.\nPush pull. Yin yang. Masculine feminine.\nFrom personal to social to cultural to cosmic.\nYou cannot achieve new heights, perspectives, or levels of consciousness if you never accept the battle, lose your ground, and propel in a new direction.\nEmotional Transmutation\nTransmutation (noun): the action of changing or the state of being changed into another form.\nI have a tattoo on my right forearm.\nAn ouroboros.\nA symbol for alchemy.\nIt is an image of a snake eating its own tail in the shape of an infinity sign.\nA reminder that creation demands destruction and that one cannot exist without the other.\nIt points to the Law Of Equivalent Exchange which states that for anything received you must sacrifice something of equal or greater value.\nBusiness transmutation transforms creation into money.\nEmotional transmutation is the act of transforming your emotional state into something more powerful.\nLike using something as potent as anger to push you toward something good.\nOf course, this can become dangerous fast.\nEmotional transmutation is not becoming a slave to that emotion and letting it dictate your actions.\nWe want to catch, feel, and direct our negative emotions like a mental Tai Chi master. We want to use, not be used.\nTo create a better life for yourself, emotional energy is the fuel, and intentional effort is the vessel.\nBy hitting a low point in life, you come into direct contact with a powerful (yet temporary) fuel source that most people waste. That low point is a rapid connection to the divine.\nWhen the time comes for you, don\u2019t waste it.\nChannel Into Building\nWhen you reach that low point, you need something tangible to direct that newfound (and hyper-potent) energy toward.\nA vision-aligned project.\nThe opposing end of the low point you fell into.\nFrom the awareness of negativity, you can easily identify that which you don\u2019t want out of life. From there, you can visualize a better future to work towards.\nIf you hit a financial low point, maybe it\u2019s time to start a business or get a new job.\nIf you just got out of a breakup, maybe it\u2019s time to shift your priority toward your health and personal development in the gym.\nMost successful people I know started their journey out of raw hatred for a situation in their life.\nThey hated commuting to work.\nThey hated wearing a monkey suit 5 days a week.\nThey hated that they let a relationship carry on, or that they weren\u2019t \u201cgood enough\u201d for one they wanted to keep.\nWhen they felt that emotion and let go of the desire to hold on, a new potential revealed itself and action became frictionless.\nMost people think that \u201chate\u201d shouldn\u2019t exist when it is just an obstruction of love. And if that obstruction isn\u2019t removed, hatred latches on and extends it\u2019s stay.\nNow, this is my philosophy through my direct experience, and why many of you read these letters:\nI believe that holistic entrepreneurship is the meta vessel for any man or woman balancing the chaos in their life with the masculine pursuit of self-generated, goal-oriented building.\nIf that makes little sense, let me explain the entrepreneurial landscape right now:\n1) Everyone is an entrepreneur.\nCenturies ago, individuals each fulfilled a purpose within their tribe or community.\nThey acquired skills and interests that fit the \u201cmarketplace\u201d that was their community.\n2) Social media is not just an app, it\u2019s a new society.\nPeople still don\u2019t realize how revolutionary social media was.\nIt\u2019s where we learn (school).\nIt\u2019s where we hire (career).\nIt\u2019s where we teach (business).\nIt\u2019s where we meet (social).\nWe live in the virtual world right here and now. Virtual reality wouldn\u2019t be able to exist without this societal backbone we already have.\nNeglecting social media is neglecting an evolutionary path toward your fullest potential.\n3) We have problem solved our way to \u201cdoing what you love.\u201d\nEvolution is the process of solving problems, small and large.\nWe don\u2019t notice it until we reflect on decade-plus-long time scales.\nAn innate human drive is to pursue your curiosity and embrace being.\nYou can\u2019t do that without money (to a point, but a hard point) in this society. Therefore, it becomes one\u2019s life\u2019s work to leverage modern technology to make an income doing what one enjoys.\nYou do this by pairing your personal interests with the skills of social media (understanding society), writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.\nI discuss this in the $1 Million Dollar Skill Stack.\n4) You are the most profitable niche.\nWhat is the meaning of life?\nThat is a loaded question, but I believe that the answer that makes the most sense is to raise the collective consciousness.\nTo help others solve their problems so we can transcend the superficial and live in accordance with what is.\nThe problems in your life are mental, physical, financial, and spiritual.\nSame goes for anyone else.\nThose are the problems we must individually solve for collective growth.\nWe as humanity are only as strong as our weakest link, and that weakest link is mediocre, mindless, and destructive. Hence, why you must learn marketing and persuasion for the sake of awareness. You don\u2019t push your worldview, you simply illustrate it and let it do its thing.\nFeed the hungry.\nThose that are full will eventually grow hungry.\nWhen you solve your own problems, it is implied that you can pass down a solution.\nThis solution is both how you gain a readership on social media (through content) and sell a product that saves the world one purchase at a time (through education).\nIf you don\u2019t know where to start, try 2 Hour Writer.\n5) A \u201ccreator\u201d is not a job but a new way of life.\nRegardless of your beliefs in a higher power, underlying metaphysical fabric, or any interpretation of a Creator \u2013 it\u2019s hard to deny that the act of creation is pure ecstasy, and that\u2019s a sign to do it more often.\nWhen you learn, dissect, reconnect, and teach you flex the creative ability of your mind, and in the wise words of Arnold:\nTo me, the pump kind of feels like having sex with a beautiful woman and coming. You know? It just feels fantastic. I am coming all the time, you know!\nCreativity is mental bodybuilding. Creation is spiritual sex.\nAnd if everyone leans into their nature as a creator, it is difficult for saturation to exist.\nYour story, or identity (that you display in the creator society), is nowhere near the same as anyone else\u2019s \u2013 even if you are pursuing the same high-level goals like \u201cmaking more money.\u201d\nYou can process 128 billion bits of conscious information in your lifetime.\nThat is your potential.\nAt any given moment, you are wasting that potential through distraction or using it to craft a conscious character by which you can contribute to humanity.\nFeel into the situation you are in.\nTransmute that energy toward a goal.\nAcquire the skills necessary to reach that goal.\nPursue your curiosity to avoid the mechanical nature of prescriptions.\nExchange your knowledge, projects, and solutions in exchange for attention and income.\nUse your self-reflective consciousness to identify gaps in your ability and fix them.\nYou have the resources.\nIt will take time. Years.\nYou may not start now and that\u2019s fine.\nThis letter may not even make sense to you at your current level of awareness.\nPush forward in reality based on your experience level.\nSeek big-picture understanding.\nDon\u2019t get trapped in the technical details.\nEnjoy the rest of your weekend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "These letters are always the hardest to write.\nThere will be little practical advice.\nMost of it will be abstract, big-picture thinking.\nI hope it can help you gain perspective on the situation you are in.\nI love observing patterns in my own life.\nThey shine light on what I perceived as a difficult situation while it was happening.\nThere\u2019s been a meta pattern that I\u2019ve noticed over the past few years, and I\u2019m going through it right now.\nIt goes something like this:\nThe Clarity Phase\nInsight strikes and a purpose reveals itself. A vision that I can start to work towards. I have the skills to make it work, all that\u2019s left is for me to accept the challenge.\nThe Intensity Phase\nPure progress is being made. Flow state is almost permanent. The skill set I\u2019ve acquired is laying the foundation for my business, relationships, level of mind, and quality of life.\nThe Consistency Phase\nI felt pressure to sustain the progress that I had made. This required systemization, prioritization, and sacrifice. It felt like a gradual decline into chaos because massive progress was not being made.\nThe Lost Phase\nI actualized the purpose I had set out for in the clarity phase. My mind filled with doubts about the future. A highly mental and spiritual phase that a majority of people get stuck in if they don\u2019t learn how to navigate the dark.\nWith the book finished, I\u2019m in the lost phase. I have some idea where to go next, but nothing sticks out as \u201cthe one.\u201d\nThese phases of feeling lost used to be more destructive, but I\u2019ve learned to be at peace with them. I hope you can learn to do the same as we dig deeper in this letter.\nThese phases encapsulate a few principles that will be necessary to understand:\nNovel Emergence\nAfter every battle, on any plane of existence, something new emerges.\nAtomic nuclei emerges when a star explodes.\nMedical advancements emerge after a world war.\nVision for your future emerges after deep internal struggle.\nFrom above to below, this phenomenon reflects on all planes. Cosmic, worldly, cultural, social, personal, mind, body, business, and everything in between.\nStruggle is a necessary aspect of life.\nWithout it, progress would not be made.\nImpermanence & Entropy\nNothing lasts forever.\nCreation demands destruction.\nEvery single phase of your life will not last. And the more you attempt to make it permanent, the more mental backlash you will experience.\nDon\u2019t fight with it, flow with it.\nLet\u2019s dissect these phases and principles so you can learn to enjoy the lows, maximize the highs, and make more progress than you thought was possible.\nThe Book Of Life\nUni-verse. One song. That is what you are smack in the middle of. \u2013 The Art Of Focus\nLife unfolds in chapters and phases.\nBooks, songs, stories, architecture, bodybuilding, life setup, relationships, mental health, and every other form of human creation reflect this pattern.\nBeing able to zoom out and see what is happening beyond the thoughts in your head can save you from a world of pain.\nIt\u2019s helpful to know what part of this everlasting book you are in.\nThat way you can anticipate, prepare for, or cope with what is happening in your personal life.\nFor each chapter of a book there is a purpose, or goal, that must be actualized.\nAt the beginning of the chapter, you are acclimating to the environment you are in.\nMaybe you moved to a new city and your routines are destroyed in an instant (even if you don\u2019t like \u201croutines\u201d your mind does and forms them at every second of the day).\nYou no longer know what grocery store to shop at, what coffee shop to work at, or even just what the common cross roads are.\nThe same goes for starting a business, getting into a new relationship, or pursuing a new goal like fitness.\nYou launch yourself into an unknown environment until it becomes normalized with time.\nFrom that place of decreased stress, you can begin to explore and generate clarity in alignment with the purpose of that chapter in your life.\nIn the middle of a chapter you have enough experience in that environment to make ample progress.\nEverything feels smooth, you reach your \u201cclimax,\u201d and achieve the goal you set out to achieve.\nAs the chapter nears it\u2019s end, you begin to decline into a state of feeling lost.\nYou don\u2019t know what the next chapter holds.\nThe \u201clost\u201d phase of life can create or destroy your future.\nAt One, Not War\nThere is wisdom in feeling lost.\nIt means that there is potential to find your way.\nBut for most people, feeling lost becomes an eternal struggle.\nThey get consumed by the fog of thoughts, emotions, and low-level responsibilities that prevent them from seeing, or creating, a light at the end of the tunnel.\nThis is dangerous. Very dangerous.\nIf you only have access to a mental bubble of certain thoughts and solutions, you may never find your way out.\nUnfortunately, this is a common occurrence.\nStress is useful to add pressure to a situation and force you to move toward your goals.\nThe problem is this:\nIf you don\u2019t create your own goals, they will be assigned to you.\nThat\u2019s all society is.\nA hierarchy of subjective goals with accompanying systems that have become more efficient with evolution.\nBy adopting the goals conditioned into your mind since birth, you commit to upholding the machine as a singular cog.\nIf the only direction in life you know is to go to school, get a job, and retire at an old age, your mind will be narrowed on the stressful tasks associated with that path.\nTo that individual, money is finite.\nThe thought of paying the bills every week sparks the same anxiety and conditions that experience into your sense of self.\nJust by living, your quality of life is lower than it has to be.\nAt the end of each chapter in your life, you will inevitably be tossed into the unkown.\nThe stress will intensify.\nWhen you leave school, what\u2019s next?\nWhen you break up with your partner, what\u2019s next?\nWhen your job becomes comfortable, do you stay in that spot?\nThat question, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d can lead to a black hole of despair.\nOr, it can be perceived as your chance to discover new potentials for your life.\nStruggle is a Universal principle.\nIt isn\u2019t only happening to you. Humans have been around for a long time. We understand psychology. Everyone goes through these phases.\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that stress is the enemy of discovery.\nWhen your attention is narrowed on stressful entities, your mind will not register potentials in its awareness.\nIdeas cannot be collected and culminate into a vision.\nYou must embrace feeling lost.\nLet go.\nSurrender.\nDon\u2019t fight with it, flow with it.\nBe at one with it, not at war with it.\nAnd make a conscious effort to expose yourself to experience.\nRead a new book. Buy a new course. Meet new people. Have deeper conversations. Watch new content. Journal more. Write more. Hit the gym. Go on a hike. Swim in the environments and information that allow ideas to collect in your subconscious.\nAlmost everyone gets trapped in this phase.\nThat would explain the state of society.\nYou do have to have a sense of paranoia sitting in the back of your mind, like an animal in the jungle.\nStay cerebral.\nYou\u2019re in the fog.\nWhen a ladder rung swings by you, don\u2019t miss it because you fear change.\nThe Intensity Threshold \u2013 Navigating The Unknown\nIn the cyclical story of life, there will be conflict.\nIt\u2019s the most interesting part of the story in fact, but many people don\u2019t see it that way in their personal life.\nAfter the conflict is resolved, there is a phenomenon of novel emergence.\nIn other words, something new comes into being.\nOn the global scale, wars between nations lead to medical advancements and global progress.\nOn the personal scale, a war in your mind leads to the emergence of insight, perception, or solution to a problem.\nWhen this happens, you will feel it.\nIt may take longer than expected.\nBut when you do find the next direction to take in your life, you enter the clarity phase.\nWith a solidified and self-generated goal, you must clarify the path to reach that goal.\nIn most cases, this will require self-education in alignment with the goal.\nIf you have the vision to start a business, then clearly you will have to learn about business.\nBut remember, learning without a tangible project to apply your teachings is not learning, it\u2019s mental masturbation.\nStart with what you know.\nLearn along the way.\nAnd when you encounter specific problems, solve them through trial and error.\nAs you commit to progress in this phase, you will gain new insight.\nThe \u201caha!\u201d moment will strike.\nAgain, this may take longer than expected. Not all chapters are the same length.\nThis is when you enter the intensity phase, the middle part of a chapter.\nIn this phase you:\nHave complete clarity on what you must do\nHave a tangible aspect of life that you are making progress in\nDon\u2019t want to do anything aside from \u201cwork\u201d because work is the funnest thing you could be doing\nThis blur of pure progress usually lasts 1-3 months, more or less.\nThen, you hit the intensity threshold.\nYou exhaust the progress you\u2019re allowed to reap from reality with that specific vessel.\nYou can keep pushing, but you will be disappointed to see that your efforts aren\u2019t going as far.\nAt this point, you must attempt to enter a maintenance phase so you don\u2019t drop straight into feeling lost.\nReaching New Baselines\nIn bodybuilding, there are 3 common phases for sculpting a desirable physique: cutting, bulking, and maintaining.\nWe can think of cutting as gaining clarity.\nYou let go of the fat, physical or mental, to reveal what you\u2019ve built from previous bulking cycles.\nWe can think of bulking as an intensity phase.\nYou are in an environment that is conducive to muscle growth, physical or mental, until you reach a point of feeling groggy and demotivated.\nIn between either bulking or cutting you can enter a maintenance phase.\nIn bodybuilding, this is where you attempt to maintain a new baseline of muscle mass that you\u2019ve reached.\nIn business, you maintain baseline revenue.\nIn relationships, you maintain a baseline of fulfillment.\nIn spirituality, you maintain a baseline of happiness.\nYou do all of the above by creating a system.\nIn other words, a routine that prioritizes the actions that get the most results.\nThe goal is to make this a sustainable part of your life.\nOne that doesn\u2019t take too much conscious effort to maintain.\nWith time, effort, and consciousness of these cyclical phases of life you begin to create a lifestyle that you enjoy.\nThe Supreme Law\nNothing is permanent.\nFeeling lost isn\u2019t permanent.\nIntense progress isn\u2019t permanent.\nEven happiness isn\u2019t permanent.\nThese phases of life will come and go, but you can trust that if you seek to understand them year after year, you will get holistic results with time.\nIf you grasp at any phase and attempt to make it permanent, you will experience chaos.\nDon\u2019t fight with reality, flow with it."

        "content": "I can\u2019t help but wonder what artists, thinkers, and visionaries from the past would think of today\u2019s world.\nWould Alan Watts have a podcast?\nWould Marcus Aurelius be Twitter famous?\nWould Nietzsche do public speaking gigs about his New York Times bestseller?\nMany people think they would \u201creject the world\u201d and retire to the woods.\nI would argue the exact opposite.\nThey would realize the raw power of the internet to spread their ideas to the world because humans have an innate drive to survive on more planes of existence than the physical.\nBut that\u2019s not the main question on my mind.\nI\u2019m even more curious about today\u2019s creators and how they will be remembered.\nIn a previous chat I had with Justin C Scott on our adventures in Greenville, South Carolina, he said something that stuck in my mind:\nThe further removed an influential figure is from their time in history, the more mythical they become.\nPeople stop perceiving them as a person and begin to see them as something more \u2013 as the arbiter of certain ideas, concepts, and philosophies.\nThey no longer live in the mind as someone who lived, but as an archetypal concept that feels as if they always were.\nIn the time of Watts or Aurelius, their language was normal.\nIt probably wasn\u2019t perceived as \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cmysterious\u201d as we often think it is.\nIt was just normal language.\nAs language evolved with culture and society, so did our perception of the teachings of old.\nIn 100 years from now, language will see substantial changes yet again, and today\u2019s creators will be perceived as ancient artifacts.\nJordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, and Mr. Beast have all added their own thread to the cultural tapestry we continue to create.\nBut who will be in the next generation of creators?\nI\u2019ll let your imagination run wild to answer that question.\nBut I believe the landscape of public intellectuals will change as a whole.\nThose we hold with high regard in our mind will diversify based on community and self-interest.\nFor every one Marcus Aurelius, there will be ten Joe Rogans.\nBut the Joe Rogans will all attract different types of followers based on their unique perspectives and personality.\nThey will all talk about the same thing via internet content, but the teachings will be vastly different due to their personal experience.\nI\u2019ve talked about the flipside of this in The Future The Creator Economy.\nEvery creator will distill their expertise and attract a school of students that resonate with their teaching style.\nCreators will evolve and their following will evolve with them.\nThis eliminates saturation in the creator economy because life isn\u2019t saturated \u2013 and we are all making the transition into the digital society.\nFinal Reminder: Solopreneur Sprints starts in 2 days and Digital Economics price doubles on that date. Check it out here if you want to turn yourself into a fulfilling modern business.\nThe Emerging Digital Society\nEvery single person that was remembered throughout time had one thing in common:\nThey were massive value creators.\nThey were fountainheads of knowledge, perspective, and insight.\nThey didn\u2019t attempt to hold their thoughts in their finite headspace.\nThey wrote, spake, marketed, and sold the potent ideas that wove the web of their worldview.\nThis is why I recommend studying those 4 evergreen skills and pairing them with your personal interests to succeed in the new renaissance (see: The $1 Million Dollar Skill Stack).\nToday\u2019s world is different.\nYou have access to the internet.\nThe internet.\nThe revolutionary invention that people see as normal parts of their lives.\nThe thing that distracts people from their potential but is the exact tool to escape surface-level living.\nThere is an emerging digital society.\nThe world wide web continues to develop in unforeseen ways and I see it as a next step in human evolution.\nYou\u2019re either providing value online or you are putting it off until you are forced to for survival.\nOver the past decade digital tools and aids have become such a part of our life that we didn\u2019t even realize we are half-robot.\nOf course, this comes with ramifications that the ancient masters warned about.\nMechanical and mindless living is the antagonist of a good life.\nThe internet must be used and it must not use you.\nThe power has shifted back into the hands of the individual. You have the ability to:\nBecome highly skilled in any (valuable) topic you want in 3-6 months.\nForm a high-level network that feeds you opportunities. This was impossible with prior barriers of physical location.\nAttract an audience to your life\u2019s work so you can get paid to do what you enjoy.\nHumans solve problems to evolve, and I genuinely believe we have problem-solved our way into the opportunity to do what we love at almost all times of the day (if you put in the work to do so).\nStart Building Your Legacy In The New World\nWe are smack in the middle of a second renaissance and future thought leaders are emerging left and right.\nThis is not to be taken lightly.\nI used to think the term \u201cthought leader\u201d was rather cringe. But it is arguably the most important endeavor one can take on.\nTo become a thought leader, you must first learn to lead yourself.\nBy leading yourself into the unknown, you expose yourself to:\nNovel ideas and perspectives\nNew potentials for your life (and others)\nSkills that you must acquire to push further\nResults you must get with those skills to maintain progress\nA thought leader will not be a thought leader for long if they do not build solutions that gets results for the occupants of society.\nThey must expand their mind to allow for thought to have further boundaries.\nTrue thought can only go as far as the experience you have.\nHere is how you begin to build your legacy in the new world:\n1) Identify What You Must Do\nThere are infinite roads you can take that lead to the life you want.\nBut the first step is identifying the life you want so you can move in the right direction.\nDance between your desired future and despised future.\nAs you experience life:\nBe conscious and observant of those around you.\nTake mental note of lives that you do not want to live.\nStudy the habits, patterns, and ideas of successful individuals.\nAdd brush strokes to the vision of your ideal future over time.\nIt won\u2019t be absolutely clear at first, and that\u2019s okay. You have time.\n2) Solidify A Vessel For Actualizing That Reality\nThis is where most people go wrong.\nThey dream and dream about doing incredible things but let it remain a dream. Why?\nBecause they don\u2019t have a clear and certain path for making it work.\nThey don\u2019t realize that nothing certain is worth having, and that the future is uncertain no matter what you do (this should be obvious).\nYou need skills and interests that you can practice and apply for life.\nIt truly doesn\u2019t matter what skills or interests you choose.\nIf you are conscious of the problems that stand in the way of executing on your plan, the next step should be obvious. Don\u2019t hide from it.\nIf starting a business is the path to the life you want, but you \u201cdon\u2019t know how,\u201d then learn how with the endless information online.\nYa\u2026 it will take some time.\nIf you realize that you need money to start that business you choose, but don\u2019t have any, then you either have to start with a lower cost business model or get a higher-paying job (or experiment with budgeting techniques).\nIf you realize you can\u2019t get a better job or don\u2019t have the skill to start the low-cost business\u2026 answer the question yourself.\nToo many people avoid doing what they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d even when it is standing in the way of what they want.\nChange your perspective.\nIf it\u2019s standing in the way of what you want, then you should want to do it.\nThink.\nDon\u2019t get distracted.\nLearn and apply the skills or interests that intrigue you most in alignment with your desired future.\nWhen problems pop up, acquire the skills and interests necessary to overcome them.\nPretty simple.\nNo self-help prescription required.\nYou have a self-corrective compass called a mind.\nUse it.\n3) A Powerful Habit Formation Heuristic\nIf you don\u2019t know why you are doing something, why are you doing it?\nMost people are unconscious as to why they are making 99% of the choices that they make.\nStart questioning everything you do.\nEverything.\nIf there is no conscious intention behind the action, stop doing it.\nWhy are you going out to drink and party?\nI\u2019m not telling you to stop. I\u2019m telling you to have a reason.\nI love the occasional party and can attribute much of my success to the conversations and people that I\u2019ve met during those times.\nBut it\u2019s usually used as a tactical reset after a period of extended intensity. It is a forced low that balances out the forced highs.\nBack to questioning:\nWhy are you shoveling hot and spicy McChickens down your throat?\nAgain, I\u2019m not telling you to stop.\nI love a good ol\u2019 Mcdonald\u2019s trip, but it still does not derail me completely from my mental, physical, and financial health goals.\nWhy are you laying in bed instead of going to the gym?\nWhy are you going to work after complaining about how you hate it?\nBecause you have to?\nIs that not wage slavery?\nDo you even care?\nAre you lying to yourself that it\u2019s for another reason?\nAre you going to do anything about it?\nOr are you just going to keep doing the same things until the day you die?\nWhen will you allow yourself to become fully conscious of the situation you\u2019ve built yourself into?\nThe answers to these questions may shock you (if you\u2019re honest with yourself).\nThere are no wrong actions, there are only actions without intention.\nLead. Your. Thoughts.\n4) Personal Distribution\nBuilding an audience, readership, or distribution isn\u2019t only for online businesses.\nIt is the new way of life.\nBuilding personal distribution is how you:\nGet a job without a job board\nSell a book without a publisher\nMake music without a record label\nBe you, learn to persuade, and you get to skip ahead of those that rely on others for their success.\nI\u2019m in the process of self-publishing my book, The Art Of Focus, that has new plans to launch sooner than expected\u2026\nThe average self-published book sells 250 copies (Googled statistic).\nThey make less than $1,000 a year.\nI\u2019ve almost guaranteed my book to be a best-seller simply because I\u2019ve built an audience over the past 3-4 years.\nAnd all of the ideas are validated through my newsletters and social media engagement. I already know that people will love it because they\u2019ve already shown that.\nSame goes for any product I built that has a slight relation to what I talk about.\nSince I\u2019ve built distribution, I can build whatever I want.\nI can start a gym, supplement line, apparel store, or even start producing music and get on a big stage when most producers will never see an audience of more than 100 people.\nFair? Maybe, maybe not.\nOr it\u2019s just the reality that people don\u2019t learn the game before they try to win.\n5) Focus On Perspective Development\nThe biggest \u201cshift\u201d for me was realizing that audience building isn\u2019t about the latest hacks and tactics.\nIt\u2019s about novel perspectives \u2013 something that AI tools will never be able to do under the name of a human.\nI don\u2019t see how AI could take something like Ken Wilbers\u2019 theory of everything, connect it to the creator economy, and distill \u201cstages of creator development\u201d from a place of experience like I did here.\nI\u2019m assuming that AI can\u2019t have insight and connect abstract patterns to its skills or interests.\nThere is a progression to this game, but you want to get to the point of contagious ideas that spread without your personal effort.\nThe creator economy is a game of mental warfare.\nThe more ideas you spread that form the identity and worldview of other individuals the more success will come to you.\nIf this doesn\u2019t make sense to you, it won\u2019t until you actually start building.\nGood luck on your path, fellow Creator.\n\u2013 Dan\nP.S.

        "content": "Life is a game and your character determines the outcome.\nYour character is malleable.\nThat\u2019s the first realization you must make.\nYou can change.\nNo matter how painful.\nNo matter what your mind tells you.\nNo matter how much you want to cling to the comforts of your current life that are causing more destruction than you think.\nYour character is your concept of self: who you think you are.\nAn amalgamation of ideas, beliefs, experiences, and information you\u2019ve processed that compose the operating system from which you interact with reality.\nFor most, their character was created for them.\nIn our childhood, every single one of us are a product of our environment.\nThe fundamental human drive to learn allows us to soak up any and all information that will contribute to our survival.\nWith this information, we are set on a default yet mediocre trajectory.\nLike a train hurling down the tracks, if we don\u2019t learn to conduct our own adventure we may end up heading towards a dead end.\nThe fate of humanity is not guaranteed.\nThis is the case for every life form.\nIf we do not make intelligent and conscious choices, we may eradicate ourselves from the face of the Earth.\nThis is the worst-case scenario, but it is an ever-increasing possibility.\nOur character determines our actions.\nOur actions contribute to society and culture.\nSociety and culture influence the programming of other characters.\nThe ideas, beliefs, and information that compose the form of our character will be spread through our choices to form other characters.\nThe collective character will determine its own fate.\nIt all starts with an individual\u2019s ability to wake up from their mediocre trajectory, change who they are, and let their actions impact the world.\nThe Paradox Of Personal Development\nLife is a game that houses infinite games.\nThere are two macro games that are the most fruitful:\n1) The External Game\nThe external game is what you choose to do with your life.\nIt is the self-generated goals you pursue that impact humanity.\nIt is your life\u2019s work (that I help you discover and create in Digital Economics).\nThe thing that you dedicate your time, focus, and money to building as a modality for value creation.\n2) The Internal Game\nIf your external pursuits are not backed by a philosophical sense of mastery, they will remain superficial and meaningless.\nFor every goal you pursue outward, there is a lesson you must unlock inward.\nThat is the paradox of personal development.\nThe higher you push in the world the deeper you dive into yourself\u2026 if you don\u2019t get lost.\nAs you develop yourself you increase your level of mind.\nAt each level, you get a top-down view of your past experiences.\nYou start to realize the structure of the system, or game, that you were playing (or allowing to play you).\nA season of internal struggle is the requirement to reach your next level of mind.\nWhen you acquire the skill or knowledge necessary, you reach the next level of mind that solves the problem you were facing.\nLike how I failed at 7 different businesses.\nI tried everything under the sun.\nLearned every skill I could.\nTried freelancing, dropshipping, agency work, and social media with minimal results.\nNothing happens, then everything happens.\nAll at once, the puzzle pieces I had been gathering clicked in my brain.\nAn avalanche called insight crashed into my psyche.\nI knew exactly what I had to do to make my next business endeavor work.\nAfter multiple cycles of this phenomenon, I am where I am now.\nThis is why no matter how much free \u201cgame\u201d I give you, you will still have to struggle for years.\nYou have to battle with reality to get the lesson that makes perfect sense to you.\nIt won\u2019t happen in an instant. You must commit to the path of uncertainty for life.\nSuperficial To Metaphysical (Chiseling Inward)\nThe path of the problem solver, or value creator, is how you escape the world of replaceability. Fall in love with the challenge that problems present, from superficial to metaphysical, and your ideal future will create itself. This is the infinite game.\nThat is a quote from my finally finished book, The Art Of Focus, launching (hopefully) this year.\nTo change who you are you must strike a balance between peace and progress.\nYou have to push outward toward meaningful goals while shedding the hardened shell of an identity you\u2019ve formed.\nCertain goals require a certain character to be achieved.\nAnd if you neglect the inner work on your external journey you will end up trapped in a surface-level existence:\nA businessman with no health.\nA bodybuilder with no philosophy.\nA pick-up artist with no values.\nThe art of self-architecture demands holistic development.\nNew problems will surface in your awareness as you achieve bigger and better goals, but most people neglect these, hence the state of society.\nWe\u2019ve discussed how to set, pursue, and achieve meaningful goals many times in the past (like this letter), so we will focus on chiseling inward.\nThink of who you are, your concept of self, as an intellectual structure you\u2019ve built with time.\nWhen you remodel a house, do you go straight for the foundation?\nOr do you start with a small cosmetic issue so the entire house doesn\u2019t come crashing down?\nWhen you start chiseling away at a slab of marble, do you smack with your hammer as hard as you can?\nOr do you make small, calculated taps so you don\u2019t turn them to dust?\nThe same concept applies to changing who you are.\nMost people want to start with deep, spiritual, and metaphysical problems that reside in their core.\nIf you haven\u2019t done even the slightest bit of self-help work like:\nGoing to the gym or training\nFixing your nutrition and habits\nAcquiring high-value skills and knowledge\nThen you are in for a bad time.\nI would argue that the people trying to be \u201cspiritual\u201d without doing the superficial work are doing it for superficial reasons.\nThey use spirituality as a nobility card to avoid making any form of contribution to humanity by pursuing goals.\nChallenge:Skill = Purpose:Profits\nWhen all a person\u2019s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person\u2019s attention is completely absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nThis is the path to a life of maximum enjoyment.\nHere\u2019s the process to follow:\n1) Pursue A Goal That Is Challenging Enough\nStart small and superficial.\nFix your health, finances, and mindset.\nPut one foot into the unknown so you feel the stress required to kick you into action.\nThis gives you a lesser purpose to actualize.\n2) Acquire The Skill Necessary To Achieve The Goal\nIt is silly to think that you can achieve self-generated goals without self-education.\nYou need to immerse your conscious mind in the information that will program a new identity (and give you the knowledge to attack your goals).\nFollow social media accounts that give specific information related to your goals.\nPurchase 1-3 books on the matter and devour them.\nWhen you have a goal that is top of mind you begin to perceive situations with intention.\nIntention = what you are stretching towards.\nInformation becomes more relevant and applicable to your life.\nYou end the mindless distraction and consumption cycle.\nIf you don\u2019t know what skill to learn, consider learning high impact writing. It is arguably the most lucrative skill in the digital age. Myself and my students have proven that.\n3) Hunt & Stack \u201cWhys\u201d To Cultivate A Personal Philosophy\nIf you struggle to act, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t have a compelling, personal, and intrinsic reason to act.\nThe first step is difficult, but you must take it.\nThen, as you are experiencing life, keep an eye out for reasons you can collect.\nI used to hate going on walks.\nI didn\u2019t see the \u201cpoint.\u201d\nOne day, I decided to cut some weight.\nI\u2019d gotten a bit too heavy for my liking, and a goal was formed in my mind.\nI started consuming information to piece together a weight loss strategy.\nWalking seemed like a great way to increase my energy expenditure.\nSo, I started walking 10K steps a day.\nOn those walks, I realized:\nI can listen to lectures and books to fuel my mind\nI can generate ideas and write content\nI actually enjoyed taking a break to get out of the house, it helped with my focus\nAfter I lost the weight, my daily activity was higher so I could eat more (win) while staying lean\nI can take business calls\nI can maintain a decent tan for most of the year\nNow, I walk a minimum of 20K steps a day.\nWhen I\u2019m bored, I walk.\nWhen I lack creativity, I walk.\nWhen I need to go to the store, I walk.\nThat last point actually influenced where I live.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever live in a non-walkable city just because of the benefits it has brought me.\nThis does not only apply to walking, but to every single habit incorporated into my lifestyle.\nIf you don\u2019t know \u201cwhy\u201d you are doing something, why are you doing it? That is the first sign of mindlessness.\nPursue goals.\nDevelop an intrinsic philosophy for each one.\nSlowly cultivate the habits that forge who you are (because your choices mean everything).\n4) Turn Your Pursuits Into Valuable Contributions\nWe live in a time where you can share your knowledge on the infinite public forum called the internet and get paid for improving yourself.\nThat is the best and most successful style of business anyway.\nThe kind that solves real, meaningful, and life-changing problems.\nMost businesses fail because the problems they try to solve aren\u2019t real.\nBy solving your own problems you know they are real.\nYou know that solving them changed your life.\nNow, all you need to do is self-reflect, create a process that others can follow, and give it to others (and slap a price tag on it).\nThat\u2019s how you turn purpose into profits.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "You have been copying people since you were born.\nThat\u2019s how you learn to operate in society.\nThere are 2 paths this can lead to:\n1) The path of the NPC\nThe NPC, or non-player character, is an individual that is a slave to their programming.\nThey never question their beliefs (you know, the ones that were projected on them and they accepted without a fight).\nThey never seek to change.\nThe default path of going to school, getting a job, and retiring at 65 are the only big goals they have.\nThey never branch into the unknown.\nTheir life becomes boring, mechanical, and animalistic. They never discover new potentials for their life. And even if they do, it scares them back into their comfortable hole.\n2) The path of the Main Character\nA main character is an individual with a clear vision for the future, self-generated goals to actualize it, and non-negotiable actions they must take on a daily basis.\nThey are aware that the conventional career path leads to the same mediocre lifestyle that you can observe in 99% of the population.\nThey understand that they must take responsibility for their lives.\nThey understand that they are entitled to nothing. That they must create success whether the odds are for or against them.\nReminder: As you know, Solopreneur Sprints (build the base of your one-person business) starts on the 15th. Enroll here.\nYou Are A Perspective Vessel In A Subjective Reality\nReality is perspective, and you are a perspective vessel.\nThe NPC and Main Character move through reality in the way they do because of their perspective.\nYour perspective is forged with time through conditioning.\nConditioning = the information you process with your mind repeated over time until those thought processes are automatic.\nPerspective and identity are closely tied.\nJoe Dispenza has a saying:\n\u201cYour personality creates your personal reality.\u201d\nYour identity (your sense of who you are) influences three major things:\nYour perspective or worldview\nHow you perceive situations from that perspective\nThe choices you make because of both\nThe NPC perspective is closed-minded and narrowed on the societal goals projected onto them.\nThe NPC is identified with the beliefs, ideas, and thoughts that they register in their awareness.\nBecause of their \u2018average Joe\u2019 identity, they will feel pulled to do things that align with that.\nThey will:\nMake similar friends\nChange their external appearance (to fit in)\nConsume movies, media, and information that reinforces that identity\nAll of which narrow their mind on certain problems and potentials for their life.\nFor the NPC, the problems often involve paying the bills, advancing their career in a corporate power ladder, and saving a few bucks here and there for retirement.\nMost of the information they consume will be negative, polarizing, and attention-grabbing keeping them in chains.\nThe most dangerous threat to society is someone who isn\u2019t reliant on it.\nFrom that conditioned perspective, the NPC will interpret situations and opportunities in that way.\nWhen someone shows them a business opportunity, like starting a personal brand, their mind will flood with the excuses and defense mechanisms programmed into it by their parents, school, and news outlets.\nWhen someone encourages them to work on their health, they attack it with whatever narrative the news has given them to defend themselves.\nIt is your job to become aware of your mental programming.\nThat is how you become the main character of your story.\nYou must realize and work to change the identity that you were conditioned to have in a society that glorifies mediocrity.\nChanging who you are is difficult, and nobody can do it for you.\nIt takes intention and effort.\nThe Intelligent Imitation Process (Become The Main Character)\nTo begin conditioning your mind for success you must:\nSet new goals for a higher quality of life\nImmerse yourself in the information that will condition a new perspective\nMake progress and notice the positive outcome it has on your life.\nStart with what matters most:\nYour mind body, spirit, and finances.\nSomebody who values fitness, like a bodybuilder, will make choices that lead to a higher quality of life.\nIt\u2019s baked into the identity\nThey will eat healthy food, train, and avoid situations that are detrimental to their progress.\nThe same holds true for someone who values building a business, spreading good, and a mind that is witty and wise.\nThe choices they make lead to more energy, less financial stress, and a deeper satisfaction from intellectual development.\nMost people will think that they should try to stop copying, imitating, or being conditioned by information.\nThat\u2019s impossible.\nImitation is how you learn.\nThe difference between the NPC and Main Character is that the latter imitates with an intelligent or conscious mind.\nThey are aware of what they are imitating and how it impacts their life.\nThe NPC will imitate the herd and go down the same path.\nThe main character will imitate who they deem successful in alignment with the future they want to create.\nStep 1) Create a perspective you can grow into.\nPerspective is reality.\nIf you want to create your own reality, you have to create a new perspective.\nThe perspective you create will give you a lens to view your present situations through.\nYou \u201cgrow into\u201d that perspective through conscious practice.\nAnswer these questions:\nWhat does my ideal day look like?\nWhat do I want to do as my life\u2019s work?\nHow do I want to impact people\u2019s lives?\nWhat do I want to look and feel like?\nWhat values and habits will I have to adopt to bring those to life?\nFrom there, practice putting on the perspective of your future self as you go about your days.\nIt will be difficult at first, but you will start to spot problems and opportunities that you can act on.\nStep 2) Choose 3-5 \u201cmentors\u201d that you aspire to be like.\nYou become what you consume, so consume in accordance with who you want to become.\nMake this process easy by writing down the 3-5 names of the people that have changed your perspective.\nWhat is your favorite book that you recommend to everyone? Write down the author\u2019s name.\nWho is the YouTuber, podcaster, or blogger that you can\u2019t stop watching? The one that \u201cblows your mind\u201d every time they post?\nWhat social media accounts do you follow that make you think, \u201cHow did they say that so perfectly?\u201d\nBecause that\u2019s the thing\u2026 not everyone thinks that. Only you. The combination and connection of these \u201cmentors\u201d is how you create your own niche, perspective, and content that separates you from the crowd.\nRe-read the first chapter of your favorite books again \u2014 I guarantee your brain will light up.\nStep 3) Become a mad scientist.\nThe good life is a series of experiments.\nYou can\u2019t copy it from someone else. You have to try, fail, and collect the pieces that make your individual life great.\nThe NPC takes what is put in front of them.\nThe main character leans into the trial and error that reflects in nature toward evolution and growth.\nAs you are immersing yourself in information from your mentors and pushing toward your goals, follow the scientific process.\nResearch \u2013 don\u2019t mindlessly consume content. Gather it to apply to your goals.\nTest \u2013 don\u2019t take advice or information as law. Test if it works for your situation.\nExperiment \u2013 don\u2019t be dogmatic about one method. Try different diets, business models, and religious ideologies until the truth of each blurs in the middle.\nDiscover \u2013 note patterns that get results in alignment with your goals.\nDocument \u2013 write down what gets you results. This is the valuable information that you can sell or leverage.\nWhen you treat your life as a project, it becomes profitable.\nA personal brand is just discovering yourself in public and getting paid for the research you do.\nStep 4) Create or be created.\nThe primary difference between the NPC and the Main Character is creation.\nThe NPC is created through years of conditioning that remains unconscious.\nThe Main Character is created through years of conscious conditioning (they choose their inputs).\nNobody escapes conditioning.\nIt\u2019s happening all around you.\nThis letter is conditioning you. Hopefully toward something good.\nThe modern world is create or be created.\nThe choice is yours (at every millisecond of the day).\nEnjoy your weekend.\n\u2013 Dan\nP.S.

        "content": "The creator economy is a decentralized society where people can learn, teach, and create a better life for themselves.\nI made this realization over the past decade.\nWhen I was a child, I didn\u2019t trust the school system (or my parents) to equip me with the knowledge necessary to make the most of my life.\nInstead, I consumed content from YouTubers, bloggers, and social media accounts that were teaching about fitness, business, and philosophy.\nI bought affordable courses that taught me more than my overpriced college degree.\nMy college degree got me into a $60K/year job.\nMy internet studies built me a business that enables me to do anything I want in this life.\nEducation is only one aspect of the creator economy.\nI see it as a self-sufficient Utopia that is the product of human desire and evolution.\nI have a person that sells shoes.\nI have a person that sells kitchenware.\nI have a person that sells blue light glasses.\nI have a person that sells apparel.\nI have a person that sells coffee and supplements.\nI have a person that sells fresh herbs, milk, and meat.\nAll of which have an underlying philosophy that holds more depth than today\u2019s shallow brands and mega corporations that just want your money.\nThis thread is a prime example of what I mean:\nThis is why I made the Sol short\n\nA classic, short-inseam 100% cotton short that was flexible, comfortable and looked stylish paired with whatever on top.\n\nCouldn\u2019t find it, so I made it. https://t.co/vB85NhzpCH\n\u2014 \ud83c\udf1e Sol Brah \ud83c\udf1e (@SolBrah) April 22, 2023\nAnd, of course, I have plenty of individuals that I can acquire specific knowledge from in relevant fields.\nIf I want to learn stock or real estate investing, I can acquire that knowledge for a fraction of what it would cost from a degree. And I would get 10x the results because the person teaching it actually has results.\nThe creator economy is where you:\nFind people with shared goals\nCurate your own community\nProvide value to that community\nGet paid for your contributions\nMy recommendation is to start with what we\u2019ve learned in previous letters.\nStart an education business by pursuing your purpose (because it has minimal startup costs and huge profit margins).\nCreate an independent income for yourself.\nThen, build a business that you really want to build.\nMy little one-person education business makes around $1.5 million a year.\nI am now writing a book, building software, and strategizing the true impact I want to leave on the world. I have the money and resources to do it, but only because I started with what was available to me.\nI didn\u2019t fantasize about building a billion-dollar company just to leave me paralyzed with overwhelm and anxiety.\nThat\u2019s exactly how you make 0 progress.\nP.S. This style of business (solving your own problems and selling the solution) is exactly what I help with in Digital Economics.\nSolve Your Problems For Profit & Purpose\nMy entire business journey was selfish.\nAll I did was build for myself, write to myself, and sell to myself.\nWhen you are the niche, saturation and competition cease to exist.\nIf you want to profit off of your purpose:\nIdentify a problem in your life\nSet a goal to reveal your present purpose\nExperiment with different solutions\nFind what works and create your own\nTalk about your journey in public\nOffer your solution with a price tag on it\nRepeating this process has been the guiding light in my life.\nEver since I can remember I\u2019ve always had a project to build.\nA project is an organized way for achieving your goal (or purpose).\nA few years ago, I struggled with productivity.\nIt was difficult to focus and I knew that I could be doing more.\nThat was the problem that I became aware of.\nSo, I made it my purpose to fix that area of my life.\nI watched YouTube videos, purchased supplements, and ordered a few different planners and journals.\nI was adamant on solving the problem, so I experimented with every piece of advice I got.\nAfter a few months, I had gotten some incredible results.\nSo, I sat down to create a sustainable productivity solution that would fit me to perfection (because there was always one minor issue with the other methods I tried).\nThis is when I designed and launched the digital Power Planner.\nI didn\u2019t have many followers at the time, but I loved the thought of making a living from my productivity knowledge. So, I:\nWrote content on what I knew about productivity\nGrew a following with the proper strategies\nPromoted the digital planner as a free download\nAdded educational resources to the free download\nPeople loved it.\nSo, I took it further and launched a physical version of the planner.\nThings are different now, but the entirety of my success is built on solving my own problems and selling the solution.\nI solved my career problems by learning web design (so I built a course).\nI solved my money problems by succeeding with freelancing (so I built another course).\nThen, Modern Mastery was born from me building what I would have wanted for a community and learning platform.\nNow, I\u2019m writing a book and building a software that I could sell to my younger self (to help him reach his goals faster).\nIt\u2019s that simple.\nEveryone is an entrepreneur.\nSome just get paid for the problems they solve.\nThe Self-Reliant Career Path (How To Start)\nThere are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies. \u2014 Naval\nThe future of work is play and everyone will be an entrepreneur.\nEveryone will be forced to create, contribute, and deliver value to their community or else their way of survival will dry up.\nArtificial intelligence points to this reality.\nAutomation points to this reality.\nMost things on the internet point to this reality.\nEven if that does not become that reality for most people, it can for you.\n1) Profitable Interests\nWe start with life direction.\nYou need a vision, goals, and priority tasks that you can execute on every single day.\nThis is how you gain experience in this life.\nThis is how you gain knowledge, skill, and the direction to acquire both that you can pass down to those on the same path.\nAll burning problems (in your life and others) fall within the eternal markets: Health, wealth, and relationships.\nSelf-improvement is about solving your own problems in those domains.\nBusiness is about providing a solution to problems in those domains.\nSimply by:\nSetting a purposeful goal to improve yourself\nSelf-educating and acquiring the skills for your mind, body, and business\nLetting your curiosity guide which methods you choose and create\nYou will have the experience necessary to help others and profit off of living with purpose.\nCuriosity is a crucial touchpoint there.\nWhat makes you unique is your ability to find the combination of knowledge that gets you results.\nIn business, some may be curious about e-commerce or website flipping.\nOthers may be curious about personal branding and digital products.\nIn health, some may be curious about sports and optimal performance.\nOthers may be curious about bodybuilding and biohacking.\nToo often we think that we are doing the same thing as everyone else.\nYour story is vastly different.\nEveryone has to pursue goals in the same eternal markets. You won\u2019t escape that. But the way you pursue those goals can be unique to you, and that\u2019s what makes your experience profitable.\n2) Project To Product\nIf you don\u2019t know what to sell, sell something you would have wanted on your journey, or something you can\u2019t find but want right now.\nWhen you begin pursuing a goal, the best way to actualize it is to:\nStudy the fundamentals to gain clarity\nStart a real-world project so you don\u2019t get trapped in tutorial hell\nBuild the project until you discover a problem\nBuy courses, coaching, or research internet content to find the solution\nApply everything you learn until the project is completed\nA \u201cproject\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like it applies to all domains of life, but hear me out.\nWhen you start improving your health, you only make progress when you turn it into a measurable personal project.\nYou go to the gym.\nYou write down your routine.\nYou document every single one of your lifts.\nIf you aren\u2019t seeing progress, you research and find the gaps in your knowledge.\nMaybe it\u2019s nutrition holding you back?\nTime to track your calorie intake.\nSeeing progress in your physique but not in your energy?\nMaybe you fall down an esoteric rabbit hole of how beef liver is the most nutrient-dense food on the planet.\nSo, you experiment with it and note the results.\nWhen you treat every domain of your life as a purpose-oriented project you are required to experiment.\nThrough self-experimentation you create a unique set of experiences that you can pass down to others.\nIn marketing, you are selling purpose (purpose = goal = desired outcome).\nYou are selling the benefits of the lifestyle that come from pursuing that purpose.\nIn the health space, some people might sell a running product to 20-30 year olds that want to create a healthy social circle and get involved with their community.\nOthers may sell a weight training program to business bros that want to get jacked with only 3 days in the gym. That way they have both money and muscles so they can live a fun life. Who wouldn\u2019t buy that (if they resonate with the product\u2019s philosophy)?\nMy writing product, 2 Hour Writer, is my unique experience with personal branding and gaining millions of followers through digital writing.\nI experimented with idea generation, newsletter writing, and social media content over the course of 2-3 years.\nYou don\u2019t have to wait that long.\nI actually recommend launching immediately.\nYou need data and feedback as to how to make your products better.\nThe benefits you reap from living with purpose are your marketing firepower to help people live better lives.\nThat is, the underlying philosophy you forge through self-experimentation is how you generate a creative income from your pursuits.\n3) Personal Distribution Center\nThis all sounds great so far.\nStudy your interests to actualize your goals\nExperiment with a personal project to get results\nTurn that project into a product you can sell with purpose\nBut most people get stuck there.\nThey don\u2019t realize that you need both a product and people to actually make money.\nYou have to build distribution.\nThis isn\u2019t optional.\nMy favorite way to do this is by building a personal brand.\nOne, because it\u2019s becoming a necessity.\nBrands, companies, and employers alike are hiring based on your public resume (your profile).\nTwo, the following you gain is leverage.\nYou can pivot as your life does and sell anything you want (as long as you don\u2019t box yourself into one narrow niche).\nThree, most other forms of distribution leave you with nothing.\nPaid ads and cold outreach are extremely powerful, but what happens when you stop doing them?\nDo you have an audience or email list that was built along the way?\nCan you ever take a break?\nCan you cultivate a meaningful philosophy behind your brand and not be limited in the products you sell?\nMaybe, but it\u2019s not likely.\nBuild a personal distribution center by:\nPassing down the lessons you learn pursuing your goals\nWriting out your thoughts, beliefs, and opinions to separate yourself from others\nTeaching what you learn in a persuasive manner\nThat\u2019s really it.\nThere are technical details and nuanced strategies for social media growth\u2026 but that\u2019s a goal and project that you can experiment with for yourself.\n(That\u2019s how you start learning every marketable skill there is, by building your business and applying what you learn to it).\nThis is the future career path.\nThis is how you monetize close to everything you learn.\nThis is how you get paid for just living.\nThe future belongs to people that pass down their valuable experiences to improve others\u2019 lives.\nThat\u2019s what all the best businesses do, just take a look at the next social media post you see (from the lens of a creator, not a consumer) and you can verify this for yourself.\nJoin in on the self-sufficient and growing utopia that is the creator economy and thank me later.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "When I first started out in business I felt like freelancing was the only option.\nI didn\u2019t feel authoritative enough to build a personal brand.\nI didn\u2019t have the money to order quality products for an eCommerce brand.\nI didn\u2019t even know what consulting was.\nAgency and freelance work are marketed towards beginners, and for good reason:\nYou can learn skills for free (or cheap with courses compared to a college degree).\nYou don\u2019t need to invest time in building an audience to land clients (although I highly recommend building one).\nYou only need 3-4 clients a month to make a great income.\nIt was a no-brainer.\nAnd I still think it\u2019s a great option.\n36% of the workforce are freelancers.\nAnd with decentralization and the future of work shifting, I believe that number will skyrocket upward of 90% in the next decade. (I like making delusional predictions).\nEveryone will be a freelancer.\nThat is, until they evolve as a creator, productize their knowledge, and scale as a one-person business. If they want to escape the feast or famine client cycle.\nAnd still, the options are endless.\nEndless niches to go into.\nEndless skills to learn.\nEndless outreach strategies to test.\nIt\u2019s no wonder online business is so overwhelming.\nIt\u2019s all so new.\nIt hasn\u2019t been around for long\u2026 maybe a few decades? If that? That\u2019s pretty insane.\nAnd you won\u2019t find any college course teaching the strategies that creators are.\nSo, for those that think freelancing is your only option, I want to present something new.\nBut first, I need to shed some of your limiting beliefs.\nEducation Businesses Are The Most Meaningful Business Models (Especially For Beginners)\nPeople love to talk bad about education businesses.\nThey think it\u2019s just a bunch of people scamming and manipulating because information isn\u2019t tangible.\nIn reality, it\u2019s the most meaningful and results-oriented business model there is.\nEspecially with a broken school system.\nIf it weren\u2019t for the online education industry and \u201cscammers\u201d selling $50 courses (I bought way too many), I would not have a 7 figure business talking about what I love. Simple as that.\nYou will only find new, specific, and relevant information inside online courses.\nWho cares if you waste $50 here and there but find the one sentence that makes it all click for you.\nMost are just impatient.\nThey\u2019re cool with college taking 4 years to get a sub-6-figure salary and have their life taken from them, but don\u2019t believe in a decentralized individual teaching from experience and results. It\u2019s going to take close to the same amount of time, but you\u2019ll see exponential results once it clicks.\nFix your expectations.\nTo understand the importance of information and education (especially in business) we must understand evolution.\nAnimals seek to replicate the information in their genes.\nWhile humans do the same, we also have the unique trait that we seek to replicate the information in our consciousness.\nWe don\u2019t only try to survive our physical form, but our mental form.\nOur \u201cmental form\u201d is our sense of self.\nWe project and communicate the ideas, beliefs, and values that we identify with.\nWe are literally trying to reproduce who we are in every interaction.\nAnd when people don\u2019t agree with the beliefs we hold so tight, that is when arguments take over.\nParents instill pieces of their \u201cself\u201d into their children.\nAnd the parents did the same depending on the religious ideaology, career paths, and beliefs as their parents.\nIn every interaction, you are spiritually impregnating the minds of others with the content of your consciousness.\nNow, before I start sounding crazy, why does this matter?\nEducation is the pillar of progress and evolution.\nEducation changes human behavior.\nEducation creates useful people that contribute to society, earn more, and create jobs.\nThe education industry will only continue to grow and those that don\u2019t accept it may be left behind.\nBy the way, I teach all of this in my Digital Economics masterclass.\nEducation & The Creator Economy\nA \u201ccreator\u201d banks on three pillars:\nInspiration\nEducation\nEntertainment\nSome go all in on one.\nSimilar to how Mr. Beast is solely an entertainment creator.\nSome theme pages like \u201cMillionaire Motivation\u201d accounts are based on inspiration.\nMany tutorial accounts are only based on education.\nIn my eyes, a holistic approach is best.\nLike how Joe Rogan incorporates all of the above (because he leverages who he is).\nOr how I use personal experience for inspiration, philosophical musings for entertainment, and hard advice for education.\nThe usage of all 3 creates a sustainable business where you are the niche.\nThe future belongs to those that hold the most mental real estate.\nIn other words, it belongs to those that capture attention and replicate the valuable aspects of their self.\nYou need to focus on having your ideas stick in the minds of your readers.\nLike how when I\u2019m in an emotional rut, I remember the big ideas from The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle.\nI attribute my progress to him and pass along his work.\nWho knows how much money he has made because of my subtle yet consistent contributions.\nStop thinking of content as a means to income.\nWill your ideas be mentioned in a top 10 podcast episode?\nWill your ideas be in the intro of a best selling book?\nWill your ideas be mentioned in viral videos and tight knit newsletters?\nWrite for impact and the income will come (see: 2 Hour Writer).\nIn order to do this, you must develop yourself.\nPersonal development is about solving your own problems.\nBusiness is about solving other people\u2019s problems.\nSo, develop yourself, document the solution via an education business, and develop others.\nBy treating your life as your life\u2019s work you go on to change the course of humanity for the better.\nWithout realizing it, you impact individuals in a manner that induces positive behavior change.\nFrom the individual to collective, you change the world for the better. Even if you don\u2019t want to think of it that way.\nThe 3 Point Micro Business Model\nI don\u2019t want to overwhelm you.\nI want to give you a practical business model that you can start building today.\nIt will be extremely difficult at the start (as ALL things are).\nBut as the path of mastery goes\u2026 it starts as difficult but becomes more pleasurable with time.\nIf you can make it past the difficulty threshold through practice, iteration, and persistence it will all work out.\nNotice how I said iteration.\nIf something isn\u2019t working, try something else.\nThe word \u201ctry\u201d means that you are taking on a challenge that you have the skill to take on.\nThis creates the soft conditions for a flow state, or a state of maximum enjoyment.\nIf you\u2019re lost, learn.\nWhen you have direction, act.\nMake mistakes. Be embarrassed. Create a giant mess so you have something to improve. And when you feel lost, repeat the process.\nIf I wanted to decrease my workload any further, I would still have this structure, just distributed to less social platforms.\nMost of Twitter\u2019s successful creators emulate this structure and create their own little digital reality that their followers can reside in.\n1) Start A Newsletter\nNobody wants to start a newsletter because they don\u2019t have any subscribers.\nThat\u2019s exactly why you should start one.\nNobody is watching.\nWould you rather practice your writing when you don\u2019t have subscribers? Or would you rather wait until the fear of writing a first issue to 5,000 people prevents you from writing at all?\nWhy should you care about writing a newsletter?\nIt develops the most authority (short form only holds so much attention).\nYou own the audience you acquire (social platforms can go down at any moment).\nThis is where you sell your products or services to people that care about you (rather than spamming social media and looking scammy).\nLong form content should be the pillar of your business.\nIt forces you to develop depth behind your thoughts.\nThat way you attract a dedicated audience that actually wants to pay you (and you don\u2019t become a shallow advice giver on other platforms).\nWhen you have long form content, you can skip most of the sales and marketing hacks that people tell you to learn.\nHow do you start writing a newsletter?\nHunt For High Performing Ideas\nIt\u2019s not animation.\nIt\u2019s not captions on clips.\nIt\u2019s not tweet structures.\nIt\u2019s not actionable lists.\nIt\u2019s not the perfect bio.\nIt\u2019s not a colorful thumbnail.\nIt\u2019s the ideas people collect from someone they like.\nThings like animation help of course.\nThey catch attention and immediately boost your brands quality beyond 99% of creators.\nSo, if you have great ideas and want them visualized, check out Keyframe, my animation agency (established creators only).\nTo find high-performing ideas:\nFilter your favorite YouTubers videos by \u201cmost popular\u201d and study the titles.\nSign up for Medium.com, select your interests, and study your homepage suggestion\u2019s headlines daily.\nRead books until a novel idea catches your attention, write it down, and use it in your writing, videos, and speaking.\nMy absolute favorite way to generate the most ideas is by studying top tweets.\nPeople still sleep on Twitter.\nYet, it forces people to condense what they are saying into the most impactful 280 characters (most people just drag their point on and ruin their engagement potential).\nThis is why my text posts on Instagram outperform most other image-based creators.\nI use TweetHunter to filter the accounts I love, absorb their top ideas, and schedule my best content.\nStudy Frameworks & Use Them As Training Wheels\nNow that you have the idea, you need to practice articulating it in a persuasive, valuable, and impactful manner.\nIn other words, you need to write it in a way that illustrates the pains, problems, and solutions that people relate with and want to implement. I wrote about this in the Value Creation letter.\nStudy top performing tweets, deconstruct what they look like and why they work, and practice writing it with your unique idea.\nStudy small copywriting frameworks like PAS and AIDA to tap into human psychology.\nFor long form study PASTOR or the systems I give out in 2 Hour Writer.\nConsume social media and marketing content from the lens of a creator, not consumer, and again\u2026 practice.\nIdeas are only as impactful if they are consumed.\nIf you can\u2019t capture and hold attention, nobody will digest what you are saying.\nDistribute To All Platforms\nOnce you write a newsletter you can:\nUse it as a YouTube script (most people wing it and the videos fall flat).\nUpload it to a blog so you can repost it for life (if it has your products or services, that\u2019s how you sell them).\nThose are the only two places I upload my long form content, but you can do more like Medium if you\u2019d like.\n2) Condense Into Medium Form\nIf you want to stand out on short form platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn you should prove your authority through medium form content.\nI do this by:\nTaking the main ideas from my newsletter.\nOutlining a shorter and more concise post.\nWriting it as a Twitter thread (because you are forced to condense your ideas to be the most valuable).\nKeeping the thread to 10-15 tweets in length maximum.\nThat way, they can be turned into an Instagram and LinkedIn carousel with a few minutes of effort.\nEasy.\nMedium form develops more authority and generates more sales, leads, and opt ins than short form.\nThe longer you hold attention, the more perceived value you gain as a brand.\n3) Break Off Into Short Form\nShort form is your growth and testing mechanism.\nEvery single part of your thread can be turned into a standalone tweet.\nYou can also read through your newsletter and generate ideas that way.\nOr, when you are hunting for ideas, you can schedule tweets inside TweetHunter.\nWhy Twitter?\nBecause it is a testing ground.\nAlmost all of my newsletter ideas come from previous tweets that performed well.\nThat way I know that the newsletter, YouTube video, and thread will also perform well.\nYou\u2019ve just created a self-sustaining content ecosystem that you can milk for your entire life.\nBuild Distribution, Then Monetize\nEverything above will form a few levers that you must move on a daily and weekly basis.\nThis is how you build an audience, traffic source, or distribution.\nThen, you need somewhere to send that traffic in order to monetize.\nI\u2019ve spoken about monetization methods a billion times before:\nStudy your interests\nStart a service business\nGrow an audience\nWork for free\nDevelop your process\nIncrease prices\nRepeat 5-6\nProductize your process\nScale your audience and your income scales with it\nBut, with this 3 part micro business approach, there are a few other ways.\nShaan Puri, as an example, built his newsletter to 100k subscribers and made $50K/month from sponsorships.\nIf you film your newsletter as a YouTube video, you can accept sponsorships and get paid for adsense.\nMaxx Chewning recently mentioned that he makes around $100K/year from adsense, but makes $1M/year from sponsorships.\nAdd on a digital product like Justin Welsh\u2019s content systems and boom, you add a 3rd $100K/month income stream.\nLiterally the only thing you have to do is focus on building an audience (the right way), and once you do, you are set for life.\nYou have infinite monetization options available to you that do not involve monetizing from begging for donations.\nGive value, build distribution, ask to get paid.\nThat\u2019s it.\nEnjoy your week.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

(But it was an incredibly fun way to spend my time).\nWhen I did get a job, the list above was my assigned state of living.\nI didn\u2019t have control over how I structured 10 hours of my day.\nEverything revolved around my work whether I wanted it to or not.\nOver the past 3-4 years of my creator journey, I\u2019ve realized a few things:\nEntrepreneurship is the only path for long-term logical thinkers\nHumans have been removing labor work since the beginning of time (and we are on the horizon of complete removal)\nThe creator economy is the new economy. If you don\u2019t have a personal brand you lose. Like that Black Mirror episode \u201cNosedive,\u201d but in a good way.\nSensible people get paid for doing what they enjoy doing (shoutout Alan Watts for being ahead of his time).\nThe future belongs to the self improver.\nThe person that takes responsibility for their future and becomes a fountain of value for those around them.\nWhen done in public, it is almost impossible not to get paid.\nThat is what we are here to discuss today.\n\u201cEntrepreneurship Is Overrated\u201d\nI was scrolling on YouTube the other day and a post caught my attention.\nIt asked, \u201cWhat are things that everyone loves but you think are overrated?\nThere were comments about travel,\nBut this one caught my attention:\nI won\u2019t lie, it irked me at first.\nHow can people not realize that entrepreneurship is the only path to full control over your life?\nAnd full control is the only path to sustainable enjoyment?\nBut it is becoming increasingly more difficult to find the \u201cperfect\u201d gig for you that allows you to consistently leverage all of the intrinsic drivers that make life good (curiosity, passion, purpose, autonomy, and mastery).\nA few things hit me:\nPeople hate what they don\u2019t understand.\nThey only see 5% of an entrepreneur\u2019s life and assume that\u2019s enough to draw conclusions and close their mind. Curiosity vanishes at this moment.\nThey think entrepreneurship is overrated because they aren\u2019t entrepreneurs.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being called a wage slave.\u201d\nSorry, but your feelings are not reality.\nIf you got let go and couldn\u2019t pay your bills you are forced to work for your survival. You don\u2019t have a choice. You are by definition a wage slave whether you like being called that or not.\nNot only that, but most aren\u2019t conscious of the exploitation that is going on behind the scenes. By staying at your predatory 9-5 you are enabling the exploitation of sweat shop workers and actively preventing human evolution. (Not in all cases, of course. Think through who you work for).\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me offering my skills to already developed corporations?\u201d\nNothing.\nBut why let the skills you acquire be influenced by a repetitive and income-capped career?\nWhy not lean into your unique interests and sell those skills to a developed corporation AS a business?\nThen you aren\u2019t a slave to certain productivity metrics, create your own systems, take on more clients, and make 5x what you would at the job with less work.\nAll of this, as always, is coming back to a narrow perspective enforced by a socially conditioned identity.\nOr, they have a narrow view of what entrepreneurship is.\n\u201cYou\u2019re paying a man $50 to escape the matrix, that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\nI don\u2019t care for Tate or his products, but $50 for time-tested marketable skills is better than a $40,000 outdated degree to get trained into the \u201cmatrix.\u201d\nEntrepreneurs don\u2019t go back to a 9-5.\nI\u2019ve never heard of someone quitting a successful entrepreneurial venture to go back to a 9-5. But I hear of 9-5ers leaving their career for a better life all the time.\n\u201cYou\u2019re busy all the time.\u201d\nNo, you aren\u2019t.\nThe entire point of entrepreneurship is to reduce how much you work and prioritize the better things in life. If you are working all day, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s because you lack self-management skills.\nI work for 4 hours a day (most of the time) and cut myself off there. Because I know the quality of my work increases.\nThe psychology of entrepreneurship.\nOur ancestors were entrepreneurs in their tribes.\nAnd your psyche is not wired to remain stagnant.\nYou can do what you want, but I believe that the end goal for anyone is entrepreneurship.\nWhy? Because your psyche demands evolution for satisfaction. It demands an ever-increasing challenge without actually \u201cwinning the game.\u201d\nIn a corporate power ladder, you will inevitably reach a point where challenge ceases to exist. You become docile, comfortable, and get used to mediocre living (and you will think that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be).\nThe profound and meaningful lie in the unknown and entrepreneurship is your submarine into the depths of the ocean.\nWork consumes about 25% of your life.\nIf you don\u2019t create a career, you will be assigned one.\nIf you aren\u2019t passionate about your work, you aren\u2019t passionate for 25% of your life. Most people aren\u2019t passionate about the other 75% of their life either.\nOur career, or purpose, or mission is how we engage our attention with reality in an impactful way. It keeps us from going insane.\nAnd frankly, we can\u2019t engage our attention with the breath, body, or nature for our entire lives as a mindfulness practice. There must be a balance, but our attention must be engaged with reality to prevent a chaotic state of mind.\nA 9-5 is a stepping stone.\nI have nothing against a 9-5, but it is a means, not an end.\nUse your job to acquire skills, knowledge, and status that allow you to create what you want.\nThe Dissolution Of Labor\nThe real AI singularity, if it happens at all, isn't going to look like a sudden doomsday scenario like in a sci-fi story. The real way it happens\u2014and this is probably inevitable\u2014is as a gradual erosion of human labor pic.twitter.com/gHXoKjZjfk\n\u2014 Zero HP Lovecraft \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udc0d (@0x49fa98) April 3, 2023\nAristotle condemned manual labor as harmful to the body and soul.\nThe Ancient Greeks saw work as a necessary part of life. But only as a means to leisure, creativity, and contemplation as they considered them the keys to happiness.\nWithout work, leisure loses its meaning and vice versa.\nLife begins to lack balance and contrast.\nManual work isn\u2019t always bad. But completing mindless tasks for the sake of survival or status makes you no different than a robot or animal.\nA sense of mastery must uphold our endeavors to create meaningful work.\nYour purpose is the source of suffering you accept.\nFirst, there were slaves that were assigned most of the labor work.\nThen, tools like tractors, windmills, and self-checkouts reduced the burden further.\nNow, the majority of employees are tied to their cubicles to perform repetitive tasks that go against their nature.\nMy beliefs are that humanity has evolved to the point of not needing humans to perform the \u201cdirty work.\u201d\nAutomation and artificial intelligence have seen leaps in development over the years.\nThere have been many doomsday speculations on this, but I only see good coming from it.\nA decline in labor work demands an incline in creative and knowledge work.\nFrom McKenna: \u201cThought can only go as far as the language that paves the road\u201d\nIf we want to expand the limits of what\u2019s possible, we have to create the knowledge, ideas, and beliefs that permeate culture and influence language. That way, collective thought can expand and exponential progress can be made.\nThe future of work, in my eyes, belongs to the creative.\nThe writers.\nThe speakers.\nThe designers.\nThe creators.\nEvery person that we thought AI would \u201creplace.\u201d\nInstead, AI will act as a tool that allows creatives to push the boundaries.\nTo do this well, work is necessary, but rest and leisure are of more importance because of the brains Default Mode Network:\n\u201cThe DMN is a series of interconnected sections that activate as soon as people stop concentrating on external tasks, and shifts from outward-focused to inward-focused cognition.\u201d\nIn short, the brain is MORE active when you aren\u2019t focused on work.\nWhen we, as humans, prioritize both work and rest (not red wine and bubble baths type rest, but gym and walks type rest), we prime our mind for novel ideas.\nAnd through the power of the internet, collective knowledge increases, and our capacity for thought evolves with it.\nTo get practical:\nYou now have the opportunity to pursue meaningful work that unlocks the parts of the brain that modern society has neglected for so long.\nHumans can explore reality with passion, improve their skill set, and self-actualize.\nThe future of work belongs to the self-reliant, self-educated, and those that pursue the creative opportunity that automation and AI have presented.\nThe future is about balance, not overwork.\nThe future is about being human, not robotic.\nThe digital renaissance is here.\nThe Creator Economy Is The New Economy\nI\u2019ve been talking about this for a while now, but Matt Mic wrote an incredible thread that brings an entirely new perspective to my theory.\nMy theory = the future of work and education will be that every individual will have their own creator business (or work for creators) that act as a public school.\nI\u2019m going to summarize points from Matt\u2019s thread with my own commentary and structure, but you can read it here.\nFirst, we need to step back and realize how important social media is.\nIt can be toxic, yes, but that is a reflection of the individual\u2019s choice to consume that content. Social media is an incredible addition to my life (and most creators\u2019 lives, it is rarely toxic).\nHumans are social creatures. Social media removes the barriers to socialization through media.\nMedia is how we learn.\nMedia is how we get new information.\nMedia is how we communicate the value of our businesses.\nMedia consumes a large portion of our lives. It creates a social fabric that people rely on for civilization to operate as it does.\nP.S. I teach all of this, with Notion templates and systems, in Digital Economics. It is a masterclass on creator brand, content, product creation, and promotions for the future.\nThe 3 Layers Of Social Media\nPlatforms form the first layer of digital media.\nApple and Google created the majority of the tech we hold in our hands and have in our offices. They laid the foundation for social media.\nThe second layer is apps like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter.\nThese apps captured the same value as the platform layer in that they have billions of monthly active users and trillions of dollars in value.\nOver the past decade, a new and 3rd layer has emerged:\nThe Creator.\nLike the apps themselves, huge creators like Rogan will garner billions of followers (over the next decade) and generate trillions of dollars.\nCreators are \u201catomizing\u201d what the social networks did by capturing mass attention, forming communities, distributing media, and generating revenue.\nThe Need For Human\nWith automation and AI seeing exponential growth, it only makes sense that people will get their media fix from humans.\nPersonal brands.\nPeople that educate, entertain, and inspire according to their interests.\nUnless we rewrite the collective psyche (which hasn\u2019t changed much in a few hundred years) then this is inevitable. People are attracted to people, not robots.\nRobots have their place in decreasing labor and increasing human creativity, though.\nMy Philosophy\nBusiness is an extension of the self.\nIt is a vessel for your purpose.\nYour purpose evolves, and you must solve the superficial problems in your life to reach your deepest purpose.\nThe pattern here are the eternal markets (where the most money flows).\nHealth, wealth, and relationships.\nSolve your own problems by acquiring the skill and knowledge necessary to do so through the internet.\nPass down what you learn in the form of free content and paid products.\nBy doing so, you not only create an independent income source, but massive social leverage.\nI\u2019ve written about this extensively, but the most organized place to get the information is from the One Person Business series on my YouTube.\nCreator Monetization Methods\nOnce you\u2019ve built an audience, or even if you haven\u2019t, there are many ways to monetize, but I will list them out by priority here.\n1) Freelancing, Coaching, or Tutoring\nTo monetize from the start, you need a service.\nBuilding a digital product or membership or software isn\u2019t sustainable when you don\u2019t have ample traffic to pull in an income.\nWhen you create a minimum viable offer for $500-$1000, you can use direct outreach strategies to sell your offer.\nOnce you get some results and increase your prices you only need 2-3 clients a month to pull in more than the average US salary.\nYou don\u2019t need a large audience and 500 product sales a month to generate an income.\nWhat service do you create? I wrote about creating a minimum viable offer here.\nIn short, improve yourself and build something you would have wanted on your journey.\nPull inspiration from the products you purchased to achieve your self actualization.\nThen, help others do the same.\n2) Cohorts & Courses\nOnce you have a small audience and client results, you can transfer those results into a cohort style course.\nThis way, you can still:\nCharge higher prices\nMaintain a sustainable income\nNot need a ton of customers\nA cohort-based course is a regular course with a time frame, helpful group calls, and a community to answer questions.\nThen, when the time is right and you have a larger audience, you can turn it into a full-fledged do-it-yourself course.\n3) Build Whatever You Want\nNow that you have distribution and leverage, you can sell anything you want really.\nWant to start a clothing brand? Feel free.\nWant to sell a physical product like a supplement line? All you.\nWant to drop everything and build a physical gym or coffee shop? Go ahead.\nYou have the resources to make any business model work.\nYour reputation is high. You have social capital. And your digital products are pulling in $50,000 to $200,000 a month.\nThis is on a 3-4 year time scale of course.\nAnd just like that, you create your own career.\nBy learning, creating, and selling on the digital marketplace, you remove the barriers that once existed in the physical world.\nThe future is bright, and anyone that wants to take advantage has the ability to do so.\nThe eternal markets in business are:\nHealth\nWealth\nRelationships\nHappiness\nThese are all burning evergreen problems that people will face until the end of time.\nSolve your own problems.\nDocument the solution.\nGive it to others.\nGet paid.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "One of my favorite failed businesses was creating digital art with photoshop.\nHere\u2019s one of my favorite pieces (you can find them all if you scroll ALL the way to the bottom of my Instagram).\nThis endeavor was the first time I realized the power of social media.\nI emulated how larger accounts grew their following by:\nTagging community pages that share digital art\nCreating the best composites I could so they would get shared\nRemixed photographers\u2019 images in hopes that they would share my content (like mentioning a large account in a Twitter thread so they retweet to their audience)\nThis was almost 5 years ago and was how I gained my first 2,500 followers on Instagram.\nAfter 3 months of locking myself in my room, forgetting to eat, and pouring my heart into my creations, I gave up.\nI loved to create but had no idea how to monetize.\nMy art was valuable, but not valuable enough to demand payment.\nIt wasn\u2019t even a possibility in my mind.\nI realized that I couldn\u2019t sustain my lifestyle as an artist.\nI felt like I had to learn a more profitable skill to freelance with.\nOf course, I was an idiot.\nIf I knew what I knew now, I would probably still be creating in photoshop.\nI love writing a bit more now, so I don\u2019t plan to go back to digital art, but if I could go back here\u2019s what I would do:\nContinue growing and realize my audience is a traffic source\nCreate a product or service to send that traffic to (courses and coaching in this case)\nLearn copywriting, marketing, and offer creation to position my product in the market\nPartner with personal development creators to visualize their best ideas and become an authority in the space\nIn other words, I\u2019d do everything we\u2019ve talked about in the one-person business videos.\nAs with all of my failed businesses, they taught me a valuable lesson.\nThe skills, like photoshop, all contributed to the success of my current brand (i.e. I make all of my designs and thumbnails).\nBut there is one skill that I attribute 95% of my brand, sales, and audience growth over the years.\nThe Universal Pattern Of Human Psychology\nEvery \u201cmoney-making\u201d skill that people tell you to learn is linked with Universal patterns and human psychology.\nIf they aren\u2019t, then they don\u2019t make money.\nAnd if they don\u2019t make money, then you need to stack the skills that allow them to make money.\nAt the base of all human behavior (including people pulling out their credit cards to pay you) are three things:\n1) Survival \u2013 the desire to replicate the information in your genes and consciousness, both physical and mental.\n2) Evolution \u2013 the desire to outpace destruction through creation.\n3) Transformation \u2013 the desire to achieve a higher quality of experience.\nThese are all fairly similar and can be considered synonymous for the rest of this letter.\nStorytelling, games, music, and architecture can also be observed to dissect these patterns. The principles of each can be used to enhance the impact of your skill stack.\nIn the simplest way I can explain it, all of these use the same framework: purpose, path, priority.\n1) Purpose\nBehavior change starts with a problem and shines a light on a goal to overcome it.\nGoal = purpose.\nPurpose = desire.\nDesire = how problems come into existence.\nLike how a story opens a curiosity loop by illustrating or implying a problem.\nOr how a landing page targets a relevant problem in your life to incentivize action.\nOr how you get fed up with a problem in your life and finally decide to solve it.\nBy shining a light on a problem in someone\u2019s life, you create purpose.\n2) Path\nWhen a problem is identified and an accompanying goal reveals a potential future, clarity is the bridge.\nThe opposite of clarity is chaos, and we don\u2019t want our customers anxious and overwhelmed at the thought of using our product.\n3) Priority\nIn order for the problem to register in one\u2019s awareness it must be important to them.\nAnd if the problem isn\u2019t important to them, you won\u2019t catch their attention to show them the path. The path won\u2019t even matter at that point because it won\u2019t help them, nor will they have the drive to act.\nImportance is subjective.\nHumans perceive problems from the lens of their identity.\nIf you are trying to sell a self-improvement product to an overweight gamer, you have to position that product in a very specific way.\nBy the way, this is the same framework you can use to take back control of your life.\nThe Value Creation Framework\nThe purpose > path > priority framework is great, but let\u2019s make it practical.\nIn the next section, we will discuss where we can use these things.\nConsider all of the parts below as \u201cmarketing firepower\u201d that you can use in your content, promotions, or even language in everyday life to illustrate the value of your product or yourself.\nThese are the steps to turning dirt into gold.\nThese are the steps that, when applied to any of my endeavors, led to my business making $1M.\nThese are the steps to practicing the most valuable skill which is value creation.\nIf you don\u2019t have an offer, learn how to create one here, or how to package up the knowledge in your head here.\nThese will get easier with time.\nDon\u2019t worry if you struggle to fill these all out.\n1) Levels Of Awareness\nEveryone that you come across online and offline falls within a level of awareness (or consciousness) around their problems and your value (product, service, or being).\nNote that these overlap with stages of ego development or the spiral dynamics scale in psychology / philosophy.\nLevel 1: Unaware\nIf you want to write viral tweets or create viral YouTube videos, base your content around the unaware stage.\nIn this stage, people are unaware of their problem and your offer.\nYou want to write and speak to make them aware of their problem and how it is impacting their life.\nEducate, inform, and empathize with your readers with the problem they are facing.\nIf you are trying to help someone get fit, you may point out that a lack of proper nutrition is the source of their grogginess.\nA tweet I would write:\n\u201cYou are always tired because you stuff your face with hot pockets, Uber eats, and foods that lead to nutrient deficiency.\u201d\nA bit harsh, yes, but that\u2019s my style.\nLevel 2: Problem Aware\nYour readers are aware of a problem but may not understand it or know of a solution.\nA post I would write:\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tired all the time:\n\u2013 Weigh yourself every morning\n\u2013 Eat your bodyweight in protein\n\u2013 Drink water until you pee clear\n\u2013 Walk 10,000 steps a day\nThank me later when you feel so good that you hate the thought of ruining that feeling with junk food.\u201d\nIn long-form content, you can both educate people on the problem they are facing and provide a solution.\nWith short form, like tweets or shorts, you usually target levels 1-3 for maximum effect. Don\u2019t be too high-level or clever.\nLevel 3: Solution Aware\nAt this stage people are aware of their problem and that a solution exists. But they don\u2019t know your solution exists.\nNow you are giving a clear solution or encouraging them to act.\nLevel 4: Product Aware\nPeople are aware of your solution and other similar solutions.\nYour job is to present reasons as to why yours is better.\nBenefits-rich language is key.\nHere\u2019s a post I would write:\n\u201cWhy you should start intermittent fasting:\n\u2013 Morning focus is insane\n\u2013 You don\u2019t have to plan morning food\n\u2013 Lunch and dinner can be massive meals\u201d\nI could finish the post but you get the point, and this is already getting long.\nLevel 5: Most Aware\nPeople are brutally aware of your solution and need a little push over the edge.\nYou can either continue promoting your product until the time is right (like retargeting ads, people usually don\u2019t buy when they first see your product)\u2026\nOr you can offer a limited-time sale or implement another scarcity tactic. Use this sparingly.\n2) Positioning\nNow that we understand the levels of awareness, we can begin to craft a persuasive message.\nBy the way, I give you Notion templates and in-depth education on how to create and sell a product from the knowledge in your brain in Digital Economics.\nWe\u2019ve discussed the eternal markets many times before (health, wealth, relationships), but we are taking it deeper.\nThere are 8 human desires that are impossible to ignore.\nAll of your content, sales pages, or writing should be written from the lens of these desires:\nSurvival\nLife Enjoyment\nFreedom From Fear\nSexual Companionship\nComfort & Clarity\nPerceived Status\nSafety Of Community\nSocial Acceptance\nEducate people on the problems standing in the way of these desires and provide a solution to overcome them.\nNotice how every single person\u2019s \u201cniche\u201d is self-actualization.\nMy business philosophy that is:\nSolve your own problems > document the solution > improve others to raise the collective consciousness still holds true.\n3) Big Problem\nFrom a specific level of awareness and angle you choose to position from, you identify a big problem to begin your writing, speaking, or creations.\nFrom the \u201cunaware\u201d stage and \u201cperceived status\u201d angle, I can identify a big problem like:\nNot being able to get a 6 figure job.\nI can then agitate that problem and illustrate how not having a 6 figure job is impacting their dating, ability to pay the bills, and how the world naturally lacks a level of respect for them.\nYou can also see how that problem hits from other angles like \u201csurvival.\u201d\nShallow?\nYes.\nWelcome to human life.\nDepth comes after you solve shallow problems in your life (and others).\nNobody cares about mindfulness or existentialism if the problem that occupies the entirety of their mind is paying the bills or having sex.\nThere are stages of development that we must raise people up.\n4) Unique Mechanism\nYou need a solution that stands out from everyone elses.\nAgain, this is why I recommend \u201cfiguring it out\u201d for yourself, because you create a unique solution through experimentation.\nLike how Greg O Gallagher combined intermittent fasting and reverse pyramid training into a fitness program that fits his specific lifestyle.\nThen, he targeted problems within his lifestyle, positioned them toward the 8 human desires, and sold his unique solution.\nThink about how you would solve the problem, step by step, and slap a compelling name on those steps.\nMy 2-Hour Content Ecosystem is an example.\n5) Bullet Spray Benefits\nI love overwhelming people with benefits in my copywriting and tweets.\nWhen you give a bullet point list of hard-hitting benefits of your unique solution, you give people multiple reasons to buy (or engage).\nEven if one point doesn\u2019t resonate, another may be the reason they convert.\n6) Proof\nPersonal results, testimonials, and any other statistics or facts you can gather will help people trust that you can deliver results.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of personal experience. It\u2019s something that we rarely see. People crave human connection.\nThis is why I start 90% of my newsletters and videos with a personal experience that illustrates a problem I was having.\nOf course, testimonials are powerful, and you should make it your full-time job to acquire them at the beginning, but you shouldn\u2019t wait until you have them to start selling.\n7) Big Idea\nAfter you\u2019ve fleshed out the other value creation points, you want to mull over them all to get to the big idea.\nThe big idea is somewhat of a one-sentence summary that illustrates your value.\nMost popular quotes are big ideas.\nThe content that sticks in your head is big ideas.\nBig ideas are best found by hunting for them and making them your own.\nBitcoin is the digital currency of the future.\nUber is the modern taxi service.\nChatGPT is f**king everything.\nThis can overlap with or be any of the points you listed, as long as it\u2019s potent.\nIt took a while for this to make sense to me, and I\u2019m still unable to articulate it.\nUnderstand it through practice and struggle.\nOr, you can hunt for big ideas with last weeks letter.\n8) Risk Reversal & End Result\nA compelling risk reversal will help you close deals at the beginning of your journey.\nMost people opt for a money-back guarantee, which is cool, but you can make it juicier by pairing it with a clear end result.\nExample when selling a dating product:\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t land 5 dates in 60 days we refund your investment.\u201d\nWho wouldn\u2019t buy that?\nAnd it puts pressure on you to deliver.\nYou will have to add caveats to your risk reversal and state that they must act on everything you provide.\nMarketing Legos\nTreat everything above as \u201cmarketing legos\u201d for anything you write about, speak about, or interact with another human being about.\nEverything.\nYou have to practice this every moment you can if you want to get good.\nReading this post is not enough.\nReading anything is not enough.\nYou have to start a project, encounter real-world problems, and let reality teach you what reading can\u2019t.\nThere are thousands of minor nuances that no single person can illustrate to you in a piece of content, book, or course.\nYou have to pick them up, consciously and subconsciously, through action.\nHere are a few places you can start practicing your value creation:\nSocial Media Posts\nEngaging long-form content follows this format:\nIntroduce a problem and agitate it\nGive context or raise them to the solution-aware level (usually through proof or a story)\nGive actionable steps to overcome the problem (and preferably name that method as your own)\nIncorporate the benefits of implementing that system so people act\nUse the big idea of your content as the title or headline\nThe One Person Business that I talk about so much is both a validated big idea and unique mechanism to many big problems in life.\nLong-form content can walk people through all levels of awareness.\nFor engagement, target 1-3.\nFor sales, target 2-5.\nFor hard promotions, target 3-5.\nThis applies to newsletters, threads, carousels, captions, and YouTube videos.\nShort-form content is limited to one at a time.\nYou can turn any of your \u201cmarketing legos\u201d into a post.\nThis applies to tweets, single IG posts, tiktoks and shorts, etc.\nLanding Pages & Sales Pages\nSimilar to writing long-form content, landing and sales pages follow the same pattern.\nIf you want to practice with copywriting frameworks, use:\nPASTOR \u2013 problem, amplify, story, testimony, offer, response\nAIDA \u2013 attention, interest, desire, action\nPAS \u2013 problem, amplify, solution\nAnd get better with time.\nFor your headline and subheadline, you are trying to fit most, if not all, of your marketing legos into them.\nThis also applies to sales calls, DMs, or presentations.\nCourse Curriculum\nYou want people to act on the content you teach.\nYou don\u2019t stop being persuasive after they buy your product.\nYou have to hold their attention, give them clarity, and encourage them to act.\nHow else are they going to get results?\nAnd if they don\u2019t get results, how are you going to get testimonials?\nEveryday Conversation\nAll human communication is persuasive.\nWhen you converse with someone, you attempt to operate from a shared perspective.\nWhen you don\u2019t, that\u2019s when arguments start.\nA perspective has a shared goal, so start the conversation with a problem to catch their attention.\nYou: \u201cMan I\u2019ve felt so tired lately, I can\u2019t get any work done.\u201d\nThem: \u201cSame man I\u2019m always tired.\u201d\nYou: \u201cYeah last time I felt like this I got deep into fitness, I\u2019m going to get back on my routine.\u201d\nThem: \u201cWhat was the routine?\u201d\nYou: \u201cI followed the vertical diet and bro split in the gym.\u201d\nThe conversation would go on to hopefully educate them on what you are doing and give them something useful to try (and the benefits of doing so).\nThat conversation is valuable (and can be turned into content ;))\nThat\u2019s it.\nGo out and start practicing in everything you do.\nYour articulation, cash flow, and quality of life will go through the roof.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "Books allow you to explore the world that someone else has interpreted.\nBooks allow you to try on different worldviews to see situations in a new light.\nBooks present big, powerful, and time-tested ideas that can change the way you think. And by changing the way you think, you change the way you act, which determines the entirety of your future.\nFor the longest time, I would force myself to read entire books.\nI\u2019d never finish, of course, because they failed to hold my attention after some time.\nI\u2019ve grown busier over the years.\nBusiness projects can be endless if I don\u2019t say \u201cno.\u201d\nI have fitness and self-actualization goals that demand a consistent chunk out of my days.\nI\u2019m dedicating more time to dating and relationships because I\u2019ve put it off to build other areas of my life.\nI understand the power of reading, but it\u2019s an afterthought nowadays.\nSure, I can schedule 30 minutes here and there for a good book, but I\u2019ve never seemed to sustain that habit. Which is sad because a reading habit keeps your mind flowing with ideas. It\u2019s hard to remain stagnant when endless solutions are at the top of your mind.\nIn this letter I want to give you the process I\u2019ve used to:\nIncorporate novel information into my day (to expand my mind and maintain the zest I have for life)\nCapture ideas that I can use to fuel my own writing, articulation, and understanding.\nHave it take less than 5 minutes each day so I can sustain my reading habit\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nSet An Intention\nHumans are goal-oriented creatures.\nWe interpret information, conversations, and happenings from our individual perspectives.\nAt the root of that perspective is a series of goals, problems, and beliefs surrounding those goals or problems.\nFor most, this perspective is mindless and firm.\nThat is, it was conditioned into their head by society and culture.\nMost people are automatons with the goal of going to college, getting a job, and retiring at 65.\nSo, they perceive the world through that lens.\nThey only see what helps them achieve those goals.\nAny information that does not align with their perspective goes unseen.\nMeaning 99% of life itself goes unseen.\nIf you want to experience the depth and opportunity that lies beyond surface-level living:\nSet a meaningful goal for your future\nRemind yourself of that goal to hold it in the back of your mind\nNotice how you interpret life in a new light and your decisions begin to align with your goals\nWhen you read a book you will begin to notice potential solutions to your problems, no matter the book topic.\nHunting For Ideas\nOur ancestors would hunt for food and resources.\nBut we do not live in that world.\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about the threats that they did, and our survival needs have transcended the physical plane of existence into the mental.\nInstead, great and memorable humans hunt for ideas.\nTo \u201chunt\u201d is to reap meaningful dopamine from the web of information that we have access to online and off.\nYou do not hunt in the known. You explore the unknown to make novel discoveries.\nRead the books that challenge you.\nRead the books that pique your curiosity.\nRead the books that you\u2019ve been putting off reading.\nThe ones that have you place one foot in the unknown.\nThat way, the words pass through the middle of the right and left hemispheres of the brain.\nThe right hemisphere controls what you know while the left controls what is unknown.\nWhen information passes through the \u201cmiddle,\u201d at the edge of your understanding, your nervous system signals to you that this is a meaningful event. A novel discovery in the making. A cosmic conflict reflected in your psyche that when resolved births creative emergence. In our case, a new idea, insight, or perception.\nCertain books are so gripping because you are realizing the potential for your life. The ideas act as the raw material that you can use to sculpt the musical illustration that is your self-written story.\nCreativity Is Playing With Mental Legos\nYou are forgetful.\nWe all are.\nSo, create a commonplace in a handy notebook or app in your phone.\nYou need a place to capture the ideas that stick out to you the most.\nThat\u2019s the first step.\nThe second is to stop reading.\nSeriously, once you find a novel idea put down the book.\nYou don\u2019t read a book to remember every single word. You read a book to find a life-changing idea and implement it into your life.\nOnce you find and note the novel idea:\nContemplate the utility of the idea. How does it relate to your life in more ways than one?\nApply it to your goals. How can the idea aid in the improvement of your mind, body, or business?\nAttempt to turn it into your own. How can you rephrase the idea from your perspective?\nIf you don\u2019t have an idea development system, you can download mine here in the form of a 7 day creative challenge.\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s how you can attempt to turn it into your own idea:\nThink about your goals.\nThink about your current problems.\nThink about your personal experiences.\nThink about who you are and who you are becoming.\nThen, frame the idea from your thoughts on any of the above.\nI came across this fantastic idea the other day from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe:\nMusic is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music.\nIf I contemplate my goals of writing and publishing a book, my reworded idea would be along the lines of:\nBooks are paper sculptures. Writing is the clay and articulation is the chisel.\nI\u2019m sure it could be better or expanded, but you\u2019d be surprised how powerful this can get with the ideas you store with time.\nThe lesson:\nIt\u2019s better to focus on one idea instead of being flooded by thousands. Go deep. Sit with it. Contemplate it. And avoid getting trapped in the mental masturbation cycle of hoarding surface-level ideas that have no practical application to your life.\nRead for 5 minutes.\nIf an idea doesn\u2019t grip you, choose a different book or skip to a different chapter.\nThe Law Of Use\nMost people don\u2019t need more advice.\nThey need more powerful ideas to shape their worldview and frame their decision-making.\nThat way they make better choices, figure it out for themselves, and reap the dopamine that comes from trial and error induced progress.\nThe problem is that to reach powerful ideas you have to expand your mind to the point of understanding them.\nTo understand, ideas must meet reality.\nYou have to put the ideas you\u2019ve gathered to use and solidify them through direct experience.\nOnly then can you raise your level of mind to access the next stage of ideas.\nLike bodybuilding but with mental capacity.\nProgressive overload still applies.\nDrowning yourself in surface-level \u201chow to\u201d advice is like lifting 5-pound dumbbells for the entirety of your life and expecting to build mental muscle.\nTo brush your ideas up against reality:\nWrite or journal to dive into the depths of one idea\nStart with a common problem, steps or a story to overcome it, and the transformation that occurs from doing so (this is the structure of both human behavior, storytelling, and content marketing)\nSit with the ideas that stem from your writing and refine them\nMy favorite way of incorporating this mental expansion process is, of course, to contribute to humanity through the creator economy.\nHumans survive on a conceptual level, and this phenomenon is not limited to feeling threatened when someone challenges your beliefs.\nWe seek to reproduce through the transfer of ideas.\nOn the negative end, ideologues and zealots force their beliefs on you.\nOn the positive end, creators share their personal experiences and raise the collective well-being (and make a living doing so).\nBy writing long-form content, like a newsletter, you effectively:\nDeconstruct the idea you gathered on your hunt\nReconnect the dots through original writing\nDeconstruct your own writing into a plethora of ideas\nRepeat the process and increase your mental capacity\nIn hyper-practical terms: write a newsletter or Twitter thread, break those down into tweets, and turn your tweets back into newsletters or threads.\nThat\u2019s my content strategy in a nutshell.\nI repurpose my newsletter, threads, and tweets to all platforms (and use my 2 Hour Writer system to do it).\nNot only does it prevent your mind from clogging up and sticking on one menial problem, but you impact millions of people along the way.\nYou will know 1000 people in your life.\nThey will know 1000 in their lives.\n1 billion people are 2 people that spread your ideas away from you.\nYes, the math on this is correct (even though I failed out of math).\n1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000 people that each have access to 1000 people in their lifetime = 1,000,000,000\n(I took this idea from Peterson btw).\nDon\u2019t underthink your potential impact.\nSet an intention.\nHunt for ideas.\nPlay with mental legos.\nDistribute your ideas.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nP.S. When you\u2019re ready:\nThere are free productivity tools, creativity challenges, and previous letters on my site.\nYou can also find a paid masterclass to productize yourself in the new economy, learn high-impact writing, and a community with 180+ strategies and courses to build your own thing."

        "content": "If you can spend 8 hours building someone else\u2019s dreams, you can spend 1 hour building your own.\nOne of the most powerful ideas I\u2019ve been thinking about recently is this:\nBringing your ideal future into the now.\nThat is, dedicating time to the lifestyle you will be living, but performing the same actions on a smaller timescale.\nAs an example, I want to write for 2 hours every morning for the rest of my life.\nIt generates a base income, clears my mind, and allows me to cultivate my creativity every morning.\nFirst, the only way I realized this is by experimenting with it.\nSecond, you won\u2019t learn what you want unless you experiment with what you want now, just to realize what you don\u2019t want. This is the process of lifestyle iteration.\nWhen you bring the specific actions from your ideal future into the now, you invest energy into that lifestyle.\nFrom my law of conceptual survival, you will make decisions to maintain those daily habits.\nConceptual survival: The human phenomenon where our survival instincts have transcended the physical realm and are included in the mental. We work to survive ideas, concepts, and beliefs that form our sense of self.\nIf something threatens your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle, you will perceive that as a problem.\nYour mind will view situations through that lens and register potential solutions for the problem. You can find these solutions on social media, in books, or anywhere really.\nThis is why I encourage people to read their favorite books again.\nMy guess is that you have refined goals. You will read the books through that lens and find lessons that will aid your current endeavors.\nThe lesson:\nIf you aren\u2019t working toward your ideal future, you are working toward someone else\u2019s.\nYour time will be filled according to perceived importance, so create the importance by investing energy in your goals.\nThe Holistic Daily Routine\nYou need dedicated time each day for creativity, productivity, and experimentation.\nThe first objection that comes into people\u2019s minds is \u201cbut Dan, I don\u2019t have enough time!\u201d\nThat\u2019s fine.\nI\u2019m not asking you to do this all day.\nI\u2019m asking you to do it for the minimum amount of time you can. 15 minutes or so. Because the health of your psyche depends on it. You aren\u2019t wired for modern life, and if it has become normal to you, you are by definition trapped in \u201cthe matrix.\u201d\nMany of you are familiar with how I structure my days, so I\u2019ll make this brief.\nYou need 3 activities to pursue your goals with full force:\nOne that fills your mind \u2013 you need education, ideas, and novel resources you can apply toward your goals. This leads to intrinsic motivation.\nOne that empties your mind \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be trapped in a chaotic bubble of thoughts and useful ideas. That\u2019s exactly how you make zero progress. Write things down.\nOne that uses your mind \u2013 you need a vessel to focus your efforts. With your ideas and the clarity to execute, build your future.\nThis letter will be focused on the last one, using your mind with deep work.\nThe Need For Deep Work\nWho you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love\u2014is the sum of what you focus on. \u2015 Cal Newport\nProductivity is about getting the most effective work done in the least amount of time possible.\nProductivity is not about seeing who can work the longest and wearing it as a badge of honor.\nWe\u2019ve discussed an important concept called the perception threshold in a previous letter.\nThe perception threshold is where what was once difficult becomes effortless after pushing through resistance.\nWhen we invest energy into a goal through work, even if we do not perceive it as something we are passionate about, we reach a breakthrough where we become passionate about the work.\nIf we invest energy in something that results in a desirable future, we feel as if we are wasting that energy when we lose momentum. And momentum feels good\u2026 incredible, to be exact.\nIn a world of notifications, ample options, and overwhelm, deep work is no longer an option.\nIt is a necessity if you want to change your life.\nDeep work is how you build out your dreams in record time.\nThe Priority Ladder\nYou can drastically change your life in 6 months with 1 hour a day of pure focus.\nThat\u2019s all you need.\n1 hour.\nSo that\u2019s what we will start with.\nFirst, I want to introduce what I call the priority ladder.\nThe priority ladder is a way to structure your focused work sessions.\nWe start with a high-priority project that is based on a future goal.\nAfter that time block, we move on to harnessing our creative ability with high-leverage tasks\u2026 the ones we don\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t outsource.\nNext, we move on to meaningful tasks that coincide with our creative work.\nFourth is for maintenance tasks and exposing yourself to the world.\nAll of these time blocks should last 60-90 minutes before taking a break.\nWith each time block, you gradually introduce the potential for distraction. The first block should be absolutely distractionless.\nPriority 1 \u2013 Vision Building\nIf you don\u2019t have a lot of time in your days, this is the only block you should pay attention to. No excuses.\nIf you can\u2019t set aside one hour to build something meaningful to you\u2026 something needs to change. Fast. Sacrifices hurt but are necessary.\nIn this 60-90 minute time block:\nCreate a project that is a puzzle piece to your ideal lifestyle.\nFor most people, this will revolve around learning new skills to advance their career or starting a one-person business.\nThe actions you take in this time block should move levers.\nLevers = something that actually moves you toward new insight, progress, or results.\nIf you are starting a business, it would be silly to start writing a newsletter first (unless you use my system).\nYou don\u2019t have readers.\nYou don\u2019t have an offer to monetize with.\nYou don\u2019t have a way of actually getting readers.\nInstead, you need to educate yourself on what the levers are through courses, books, or internet content.\nA much better place to start would be the classic social media growth formula:\n10-30 replies on larger accounts (because their audience is a traffic source that can click on your profile and follow you).\n5-10 DMs a day using the non-needy networking process (so you have friends that can share your content, you need eyes)\nPracticing writing short-form content that can be spread to new readers.\nOnce you have that down, you are building traffic.\nThen, you need a minimum viable offer you can iterate on. That way, you can monetize the traffic.\nAs your processes become more efficient they will demand less time and you can start to play around with your deep work schedule.\nPriority 2 \u2013 High Leverage Creative Work\nIn the new economy, your ideas are what set you apart.\nYou must distribute them on a daily basis if you want to generate attention, income, and authority.\nIf you outsource you\u2019re idea generation, you impose a wall on your growth. Content agencies can generate traffic, but again, you all know my philosophy on this.\nDuring my second time block, I prioritize my newsletter writing.\nLong-form writing is like fleshing out the depth of one massive idea.\nThink of it as deconstructing a big idea, writing it out, and reconstructing it into a new one.\nCreativity is alchemy but with ideas.\nFor those just starting out, you are better off focusing your efforts on writing content for social media platforms to generate traffic.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t put off writing long-form content, because it will determine the future quality of your ideas, and hence the future quality of your brand.\nPriority 3 \u2013 Meaningful & Spillover Tasks\nMy third time block is when I write social media content or record videos.\nSometimes, I have enough content from random ideas that come to mind that I pop into TweetHunter (where all of my content starts that I cross-post to all platforms).\nIn that case, I try to catch up on other work, or I\u2019ll check in on other ventures that I\u2019m working on (like the idea capture software I\u2019m building).\nIn short, this time block should be for the meaningful tasks that you don\u2019t plan to outsource.\nAnd I would recommend that you never outsource your idea development.\nI don\u2019t think I will ever outsource:\nMy newsletter writing (which turns into a YouTube video)\nMy tweet writing (which turns into Instagram, LinkedIn, reels scripts, etc).\nThat\u2019s really it, those are my fundamental levers.\nPriority 4 \u2013 Maintenance Tasks\nIn my case, it\u2019s around 9:30-10am at this point.\nI\u2019ve knocked out all of the work that keeps my business healthy and growing.\nNow, I focus on tasks that will maintain my products and services, like checking in to Modern Mastery, responding to messages, and checking email.\nI leave this for the end of my work sessions because even one message can throw your entire deep work session off.\nAbsolute focus allows you to get 8 hours of work done in 2, and you don\u2019t realize this until you do it.\nThis newsletter is about 1000 words shorter than my others, but I feel like I got the point across.\nTest things out, experiment to see what works for you, and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "This is quite possibly the most popular topic in the self-improvement space.\nThese types of posts always do well:\nThe best side hustles to start in 2023\nThe best online business model in 2023\nHow to get RICH and stop being so POOR in 2023!!!! (please CLICK now or you will have 10 YEARS of BAD luck!)\nI\u2019m tired of the last example too.\nAll of these videos, posts, and articles lack one crucial aspect:\nA big picture overview of online business.\nThey focus on the technical skills, models, and outreach strategies to make money as fast as possible.\nAs always, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this.\nI\u2019m just here to paint new perspectives and open your mind.\nThe problem is that everyone wants quick results.\nEveryone.\nI did (and still do) too.\nI\u2019m here to tell you that it may not work, and even if it does, it won\u2019t be around in the next 3 months because you\u2019re fighting other bottom feeders that lack purpose behind their work.\nBecause they are in a state of survival that doesn\u2019t allow them to even consider their life\u2019s work.\nSimilar to the short-form content and ghostwriting rat race going on right now.\nI get 100s of DMs and emails from people pitching the same Walmart quality reels captions (all you gotta do is learn an actual software \u2013 not CapCut \u2013 and stop trying to take shortcuts bros).\nPeople don\u2019t care to get good, they care to get money.\nThat\u2019s a brutal mistake.\nI went through the same phase as everyone else though.\nMost people do.\nSo treat this as a seed of awareness on your business journey.\nIf you are chasing the quick bucks with the latest strategies, you have about 3-6 months left before you need to pivot, give up, or prioritize becoming the best.\nWhat Is The Best Business Model?\nThe best business model is an actual business model.\nNot a side hustle.\nNot free online surveys.\nNot investing your weekly allowance into crypto.\nA business has to generate revenue. You need cash flow.\nA business has the ability to scale, pivot, and position itself in the market regardless of algorithm changes and trends.\nHalf of the short-form content people will be out of a job because they don\u2019t understand marketing (I\u2019m not talking about a surface-level knowledge here, I\u2019m talking about deep experience).\nMoney Is The Lifeblood Of Society\nLike how your hand will die if blood stops flowing, so will your business, and therefore your sense of purpose.\nPurpose is something greater than you.\nIf you aren\u2019t making money, it means you aren\u2019t contributing to society with the value you have to offer.\nBusiness is how you make money, therefore it is how you contribute to society, therefore it is a valid purpose in your life.\nBusiness is a vessel for your value and nothing more.\nOnline surveys, prescriptive business models (like short-form content agencies), and most jobs are soulless.\nA Business Has An Offer & Traffic Source\nThis is a universal principle beyond business.\nOffer = value\nTraffic = people\nYou need to place a valuable product or service in front of a group of people that want to buy.\nLike putting a hot dog stand outside of a music festival with a bunch of drunk people walking by.\nOr, in dating, putting yourself in an environment where your ideal partner is so you actually have a chance of landing a date.\nIf you have an offer, but no traffic, why are you complaining about not getting any sales (or dates)?\nThe Dynamic Traffic Source\nI\u2019m not a fan of putting yourself in a box, and I\u2019m bullish on the creator economy as a way of life.\nIt is the new economy regardless of if you care to start a business or become a creator.\nTherefore, a personal brand is the closest thing to a \u201cone size fits all\u201d traffic source.\nA personal brand is how you become the niche and eradicate competition.\nWith a personal brand:\nYou don\u2019t have to rely on ads\nYou can talk about whatever you want (if you sprinkle in content related to your offer)\nYou don\u2019t have to rely on cold outreach (for long)\nYou build an audience so you can do whatever you want\nYour business doesn\u2019t die when you stop doing the manual work\nYou aren\u2019t cornered into a specific niche, like how Zuby not only talks about politics, but makes music and sells fitness programs (most people just can\u2019t get out of the scarcity mindset of needing to land clients, so their content feels limited and boring).\nAnd, you get to meet like-minded people, travel the world, and actually enjoy your work.\nI just got back from a trip to see Joey Justice and Justin Scott. You won\u2019t find the conversations we had in your everyday life.\nI don\u2019t care to convince you on this, because you will come to this conclusion eventually.\nThe lesson:\nA personal brand should be considered your foundational traffic source for your offers.\nPaid ads increase in authority when people know your name.\nCold outreach to your audience makes them open to talking to you (they actually respond).\nYou can pivot whenever you\u2019d like if you understand that content is about value, not writing about specific topics.\nIn other words, you write content based on ideas, not topics, and articulate those ideas from the lens of a relevant goal or problem. Topics help with idea generation.\nNobody cares about the topic, they care about how anything and everything will benefit their life.\nThe Experience Model\nI\u2019ve talked about personal brand strategies many times in the past, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nInstead, I want to focus more on offer creation.\nMost people think they need:\nThe perfect customer avatar\nThe perfect system, curriculum, or coaching structure\nA fancy physical product with perfected supply chain management\nPrior results (when you need to actually work with someone to get results)\nIn reality, you need to know more than someone who is one step behind you.\nSee: the terms \u201cage of information\u201d and \u201cattention economy\u201d. Knowledge is king.\nEverything in this world goes through developmental stages.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the globe and its seasons, progress in society, or you reaching a new level in life.\nBusiness is no different, and if you haven\u2019t started, you aren\u2019t going to hit level 10 in 2 weeks making $1 million a year.\nThis is common sense but most people set that expectation thanks to human nature, social media headlines, and the collective quick-fix mindset.\nWe have to start small.\nThe Minimum Viable Offer\nI\u2019ve talked about this briefly before in The One Person Business Model letter, but I want to give you the dirty deets.\nA minimum viable offer revolves around a single skill or interest.\nCharging big bucks takes time, experience, and multidisciplinary skill acquisition while building in the real world (not reading about working with them).\nWith your single skill or interest, you immediately turn it into a relevant freelance, coaching, consulting, or tutoring offer.\nWhen I say \u201cskill,\u201d I mean anything like:\nEmail marketing\nWeb design\nCopywriting\nFacebook ads\nBrand design\nAnything else from the $1 Million Dollar Skill Stack\nBy \u201cinterest\u201d I mean anything like:\nHealth and fitness\nPerformance and productivity\nPersonal development and spirituality\nRelationships or dating\nThose are skills, yes, but I want to make the distinction here to help frame what we are talking about.\nPackaging Up Your Offer Fast\nWith a skill, it should be fairly obvious.\nYou would either sell website design, landing page design, email marketing, sales page copywriting, or a brand design service like a profile banner, profile picture, and ebook cover design.\nIn essence, you can take a beginner level course, watch some YouTube videos, and start selling (remember that you aren\u2019t trying to charge insane amounts here\u2026 you have to develop your offer, and you can\u2019t develop what doesn\u2019t exist).\nAnyone can pick up one of these skills fast and start landing clients from your personal brand.\nI\u2019ve written plenty of letters on this in the past, but there are 10+ courses and 180+ strategies in Modern Mastery to help you do this. Or the Digital Economics masterclass to productize yourself with my personal systems.\nFor Coaching, Consulting, Or Tutoring Offers\nFirst, understand this universal principle:\nGoal (where your customer wants to be)\nPath (your unique way of getting them there)\nProblem (what they are struggling with now)\nIn a nutshell, that\u2019s all that marketing is.\nYou are selling a transformation that either you have achieved yourself, you have helped others achieve, or you want to start helping others achieve.\nRemember: freelancers gain experience by working with clients first. Most of them don\u2019t have a business to do it themselves first. They just learn the skill and start selling it to their ideal customer. You don\u2019t have to have prior results to get started\u2026 because you get results by helping yourself or helping others.\nCoaching and consulting offers are fairly obvious, you help them with an interest like fitness, productivity, or something else in their life.\nFor a tutoring offer, you will be teaching them the skill instead of doing it for them. Think of it like you are walking them through a course one-on-one.\nTeaching them how to write an email newsletter\nTeaching them how to edit YouTube videos\nTeaching them how to write social media content\nTeaching them web or graphic design\nThis is an alternate option to freelancing. You teach them instead of doing it for them.\nThis works incredible for targeting beginners. More people should create a tutoring offer (if you are beginner or intermediate, I would do a tutoring offer and skip the pain that comes with freelancing\u2026 it also helps you write about anything you want to beginners in your content).\nAnd the results you get transfer over into a digital product / course much easier.\nThe reason you are doing this, instead of a course, as a beginner is because:\nYou can charge more (and increase prices to $2,500+ after a few clients)\nYou don\u2019t have an audience (traffic) to bring in consistent course sales\nYou don\u2019t know what gets results yet (even if you think you do, you don\u2019t), that\u2019s why you work 1-1 and refine along the way\nYou can use direct outreach methods or different strategies to acquire clients\nIn short, it\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d to make a $1000 sale instead of ten $100 sales.\nYou start to realize that you are in full control of your income.\nThat\u2019s liberating.\nCoaching, consulting, or tutoring offers consist of a few things:\n1) A structure for what you are going to teach or help them with.\nThink of where they are now (point A) and what you help them achieve (point B).\nNow, create a soft outline of the necessary things they need to learn and do.\nThis does not have to turn into a curriculum, because you will be walking them through everything on a call.\nMost coaches, consultants, etc are selling programs that are direct teachings from their courses or book.\nYes, the exact same thing, because that\u2019s their method for getting results. The difference is 1-1 help and accountability.\nIf you want to structure your teachings well:\nDefine what point A is (where they are now and the problem they are experiencing)\nBefine what point B is (the desirable point in life that you can help them reach)\nThe path to get there \u2013 outline chapters of a book or modules in a course \u2013 you can use others\u2019 books or courses for inspiration to make sure you aren\u2019t missing anything.\nFill this in as you see fit. You can incorporate multiple interests if you\u2019d like\u2026 you don\u2019t have to limit it to one specific interest and be the same as everyone else. Think of how a book synthesizes multiple teachings to get to one outcome.\n2) Weekly calls to answer questions and teach them what they need to know.\nI recommend selling a pack of 4 calls. One every week.\nYou will be teaching them exactly what they need to know and answer any questions they have.\nStart with 4 calls, because that allows you to charge more at the start.\nAnd, you probably won\u2019t be able to get them to their desired end result (point B) in one call.\n4 calls allows you to create a more enticing offer than just \u201cI\u2019ll get on a consultation call with you to help you with whatever you are struggling with.\u201d\nYou are marketing a transformation.\n3) Weekly Action Items & Text Access\nAfter every call, you should tell them exactly what they should do.\nYou can create worksheets, tasks, or projects for them to complete.\nIf you are selling health coaching, have them track their food and weigh themselves each morning.\nIf you are selling design tutoring, have them create a first iteration of a social media design.\nYou should have a way of communicating with them outside of calls, like on Telegram, Whatsapp, or just texting on your phone.\nCharge $500-$1000 At The Start\nFor a single-skill freelance service OR pack of 4 calls (coaching, consulting, or tutoring) you will start at $500, increase to $1000 after the first few clients, and continue improving your offer from there as you go through this course.\nEven better, I would recommend helping people for free.\nIf you are a creator and are networking with other creators, offer them a few calls for free.\nAs you both grow, their testimonial will increase in value.\nA testimonial from me at 500 followers is worth tens of thousands of dollars when I have 1 million followers. People will buy the product just because they see my name associated with it.\nTestimonials from creators are appreciating assets.\nDon\u2019t only try to land big fish because you are desperate for money.\nSlow and steady.\nYou Can Either Scale Your Client Business Or Productize\nAs you are growing your brand, getting client results, and refining your offer through skill acquisition (never stop learning)\u2026 you have 2 options.\nCreate a more compelling offer and increase your prices.\nTurn your curriculum into a cohort-based course and use your audience to fuel it (only works for coaching, consulting, or tutoring)\nI, of course, recommend the second option.\nIt gives you more free time, less stress, and more leverage.\nLeverage leverage leverage.\nThe main downside is that you will need to be consistently growing your audience to fuel the cohort. That is difficult, but oh so worth it instead of getting trapped in a feast or famine freelance cycle.\nThen, once your cohort gets results and testimonials, you can productize further into a self-paced course.\nNow, you don\u2019t have to do any work, and can spend your free time building higher ROI projects.\nAs we discussed in the last letter, you desaturate the market beneath you.\nThe creator economy cannot get saturated.\nScale To One Million\n$1 million becomes inevitable if:\nYou don\u2019t stagnate with one underpaying offer\nYou continue growing your following (yes, this is possible, don\u2019t stagnate and blame the algorithm for your lack of knowledge of social media)\nYou evolve, your offers evolve, and you increase your income while decreasing the time you spend on work\nThe route I took to do this was with a personal brand, digital products, and endless iteration.\nIt took me 3 years (with a bit of prior experience).\nHopefully, my content can help you get there faster.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "Complex sales funnels.\nUpsells with countdown timers.\nAbsurd guarantees and flexing big numbers.\nRented Lamborghinis and beautiful women on a yacht for a paid photoshoot to market the product.\nThat was the state of internet marketing 10 years ago.\nAnd while I don\u2019t believe it was all bad, it seemed like everyone was walking on eggshells and bending the truth to make an income.\n\u201cStart an agency, you can make $100,000 fast.\u201d\nSo you can learn one skill you hate, to work with people you hate?\n\u201cStart a dropshipping store, you can ship straight from China.\u201d\nSo you can sell useless products and contribute to the cheap dopamine extravaganza online?\n\u201cTarget this niche and never break out of it. Never evolve. Never incorporate your interests into your work. Always squeeze the most money you can out of your customers.\u201d\nOkay\u2026 nobody said that directly, but it was implied in all of their teachings.\nI don\u2019t really care if you go and do these things.\nBut you\u2019re subscribed to this newsletter because you want to create a better life.\nI\u2019m here to tell you there is a way to earn a living doing what you enjoy, and it\u2019s becoming a lot more feasible as the creator economy evolves.\nI was on a Zoom call with Michael from my Modern Mastery community the other day, and we had a great discussion about how the creator economy is moving.\nFirst, the level of market sophistication is increasing across the board.\nSimilar to how people lost trust in the formal education system, the collective space is losing trust in the shady marketing tactics of the past decade.\n1) Reality Is Not Compartmentalized\nThe internet marketing industry followed the same path as the school system.\nThe common advice was to \u201cniche down\u201d as far as possible, because the riches are in the niches, as they say.\nThis has merit and is still a half-truth, but niching down on a target audience and accompanying skill is against the point.\nNiching down for the sake of positioning from a goal, accompanying problem, and acquiring the skills to bridge the gap is a different story.\nThe essence of marketing is delivering a transformation with a unique solution.\nYou help people get from point A to point B with a system that gets results.\nIn the school system, there are separate departments that help you \u201clearn\u201d in pockets.\nLike chemistry, biology, business, design, or architecture.\nThis structure neglects the interconnected nature of life that allows you to learn much faster.\nLike how the ocean divides into rain droplets just to reunify back in the ocean, the internet marketing space is following the same pattern of evolution.\nIt divided into niche compartments, and is now reunifying into a demand for holistic, unified solutions.\n2) Holistic Solutions For A Community With A Shared Purpose\nNapoleon Hill had a concept he called a \u201cMaster Mind.\u201d\nIn short, it is a group of people that are attracted to each other with a shared perspective.\nA perspective is comprised of a goal (purpose) and accompanying beliefs.\nWhen a group, or community, of people join together to actualize the same purpose, they can achieve it 10x faster than any one individual.\nWhen it comes to the creator economy, individuals are attracting a community of people that resonate with their goals, voice, and personality.\nThen, these creators are providing education related to a multitude of skills and interests that will help actualize that goal.\nLike how Kortex University attracts a certain demographic of people that resonate with my meaningful goal of \u201cwork less, earn more, enjoy life.\u201d\nThat goal is not limited to one niche or interest.\nIt is a holistic synthesis of everything required to achieve that.\nMind, body, spirit, and business with strategies that help with each.\nWe need fewer shallow promises and more solutions to reach meaningful goals.\nMost modern business models don\u2019t do that.\nDropshipping a fancy little flashlight has no depth.\nCreating a basic journal with print on demand for the sake of quick and easy cash has no soul.\nStarting an agency with a skill you hate to work with a customer avatar you hate will only result in shallow work.\n3) Clarity Above All\nThe past decade of internet marketing banked on complexity.\nProducts and services would have the same simple solutions, but they were marketed in a way that overcomplicated what\u2019s inside (to increase the perceived value of the product).\nNow, people want a clear, simple, and straightforward solution that is taught from a perspective that they learn the best from.\nSome people are very practical.\nI am very philosophical, and my audience reflects that.\nBy leaning into the voice you learn best from, you attract people with shared goals that can learn best from you.\nThis starts to paint the depth behind my phrase, \u201cYou Are The Niche.\u201d\nThe Emergence & Demand For The Holistic Synthesizer\nUnder this philosophy, the creator economy cannot get saturated because:\n1) Your Community Evolves\nWhen you don\u2019t subscribe to a specific label, niche, or compartment of reality that limits what you are capable of, the only option is to evolve.\nHumans and communities do not stick to one purpose.\nOnce you actualize that goal, you move on to the next that reveals itself.\n2) Your Products Evolve\nI started out as a web designer, my products and services revolved around that.\nAs I developed myself and my business, I transitioned into different skills and interests.\nMy products followed suit, and I effectively desaturated the web design market under me.\n3) Unique Webs Of Interests\nWhen you lean into your genuine combination of interests, your brand ceases to be compartmentalized.\nSomeone who talks about fitness, business, and tech is still vastly different from someone who talks about fitness, business, and spirituality.\n4) Large Creators Have Ample Resources\nIt is not rare to see a large creator decrease output on all fronts.\nGo and look at a YouTuber with over 1 million subscribers.\n~50% of the time, you will see that they barely post, or they stop posting altogether.\nThe same goes for Twitter creators. Huge accounts often decrease to posting a few times a week.\nThis gives new creators the ability to flood the market, generate more attention, and create the network and resources without much competition from the \u201cbig players.\u201d\nThe big players go on to pursue a new purpose, like starting a family or building a separate company with the leverage they now have.\nThe Demand For Depth\nWe\u2019ve reached a critical point in the creator economy.\nContent platforms have been saturated with basic, shallow, and regurgitated ideas for the sake of growth.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad, and still works to grow an account, but my question is\u2026 why?\nWhy over-systemize ideas?\nWhy strip the soul from your business?\nWhy prioritize growth, revenue, and shallow impact over everything?\nWhy limit the only thing that can set you apart as an individual: your creative ability?\nThe general level of awareness in the space is rising.\nThe market will demand that creators rise above generic quotes and the same old step-by-step self-help advice.\nThis can only be done when you prioritize depth, perspective, and holistic synthesis.\nThe Holistic Synthesizer\nLet\u2019s define what a \u201cholistic synthesizer\u201d is:\nSomeone who pursues their own vision, forges their path with the unique skills and interests they acquire. They do not view those skills or interests as individual parts, but as an interconnected whole that are necessary aspects of their life (not temporary pieces for quick cash grabs). Their life\u2019s work is to distill, educate, and distribute their personal experience on the path.\nIn short, a holistic synthesizer who documents their pursuit to the good life in a persuasive and educational manner.\nThat way, you can attract the community that resonates with your voice, help them reach their shared goals, and not limit yourself to a compartmentalized aspect of reality.\nYour brand is your story \u2013 where you are now, regardless of experience.\nYour content is your school \u2013 what helped you get there.\nYour product is the map \u2013 a holistic system that helps people get to where you are with less trial and error.\nThe internet has given you the power to self-educate much faster than any human has ever been able to.\nTake it upon yourself to improve your life, pursue your curiosity, and share your discoveries.\nIs there anything better you could be doing?\nBefore you go off and start a billion-dollar tech company, consider starting with the only thing that matters:\nImproving the one thing that every human must improve to evolve: the quality of their human experience.\nWhen more people master their personal lives, they can put the creative ability of their minds together to work on global problems.\nBy the point you do this, you will know what to do.\nYou will become a large creator that pursues new avenues and desaturates the market beneath them.\nA New Way Of Life\nThe creator philosophy is not a business model, but a way of life.\nImprove yourself > improve others that want to be helped.\nHere are the steps that you can start acting on today:\n1) Master Your Survival\nYou can\u2019t sustain authenticity when you need something from someone else.\nEvery single individual on this earth has to self-actualize in order to contribute to humanity in the best way they can.\nSelf-actualization: to fulfill the desire to become everything one can be. To actualize your potential.\nWhile this can be done with the perfect career path, that\u2019s not what I can help with. Nor is it something that you have full control over.\nEntrepreneurship is modern-day survival.\nWe hunt for resources (money, in the modern sense) to fulfill our needs and create work that we enjoy. And if we don\u2019t enjoy certain aspects, a business allows you to eliminate, delegate, or automate that aspect of work.\nMy recommendation is still the same:\nSolve the biological problems in your life\nImprove your health, finances, and socialization\nDiscover your interests through improvement\nThis takes time, but does not limit you from generating an independent income source.\n95% of people\u2019s problems revolve around health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\nIf you can solve those problems in your own life and document the solution, you can charge for the knowledge you acquire.\nIndividuals don\u2019t learn best from someone 10 steps ahead of them, but from someone that is 1 step ahead of them.\n2) Create Your Own Philosophy\nThere is enough shallow advice on how to make money, how to get laid, and various bandaids you can apply to your mental health.\nWe need more individuals that are truth seekers.\nThe individuals that understand that prescribed step-by-step advice looks good on the outside, but is hollow on the inside.\nWe need more people that attack the root of the problem, which is often metaphysical, spiritual, or epistemological.\nThe world is desperate for depth, and that can only be created by forging your own path.\nPhilosophy is based on experience.\nYou have to set your mind on an ideal future, pursue it wholeheartedly, make mistakes, and correct your actions.\nWe aren\u2019t here to get the same results that everyone else has gotten for decades.\nAs an example, my ideal future is to work 4 hours a day, do what I want in my free time, and help others realize a better way of living.\nMy philosophy is fueled by the teachers I resonate most with.\nI\u2019ve burned through books on psychology, philosophy, modern work, and modern rest to refine my philosophy through experience.\n3) Turn It Into A Public School\nI\u2019m convinced that the future of schooling will be done online, with creators as teachers, and each student can join the \u201cschool\u201d that aligns the most with their interests, values, and preferred method of learning.\nOne school system wouldn\u2019t dominate 12+ years of their life.\nStudents would evolve beyond one creator-based \u201cschool\u201d after a few years, go on to the next, and eventually be able to start their own \u2013 if the other schools have the underlying principle of critical thinking and personal experience.\nMake it your life\u2019s work to create a library of knowledge and share it online under your brand, or school, with an underlying philosophy that attracts the right people.\nYour public school is digital real estate.\nTwitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to attract a broad audience.\nYouTube, podcasting, and a blog or newsletter to educate and nurture the audience.\nAnd a host of products, from low-cost courses to memberships to high-cost tailored coaching.\nThis is what I\u2019ve dedicated myself to teaching because I see the opportunity in the space.\nSo, I offer 2 Hour Writer to help people get their ideas out without prior experience.\nThen, I offer a more expensive masterclass, Digital Economics, to productize yourself for those that are serious about making this work.\nEventually, you will gain the resources to start whatever kind of business you want to further your message.\n4) Create A Holistic Solution\nI\u2019ve worked with 5000+ creators and one of the main problems is not knowing what to sell, or not knowing how to make what they sell unique.\nI will flesh out my Minimum Viable Offer strategy in the next letter.\nThat will help you get started from 0.\nI especially like creating a \u201ctutoring\u201d offer that nobody does in the space yet. I\u2019ll show you how to create one.\nUntil then, here\u2019s what you do:\n1) Identify A Desirable Goal\nWhat is one big goal in your life that you are trying to achieve, or have achieved?\nAre you fit? Have you acquired a skill (like writing)? Have you understood the nature of reality? What is it? What have you accomplished, no matter how small or insignificant you think it is?\nThe key with this:\nDon\u2019t focus on the goal itself, but on the lifestyle it has created for you.\n2) Identify Your Starting Point\nWhat made you want to change?\nWhat was the burning problem in your life?\nWhat did your life look like before the goal?\nMarketing is about transformations.\nYou are helping others go from point A (where you were) to point B (the desirable goal).\n3) Outline A Unique Path\nNow, outline modules, chapters, or steps necessary to get from point A to point B.\nYou are at a point in life where you can look back and help others navigate the mistakes you made.\nAct like you are outlining a book.\nFill in the blanks for what people need to know, learn, and do in order to reach the goal.\nStart thinking about this now, we will come back to it in the next letter.\n5) Branch Into New Opportunity\nAs you start, grow, and evolve as a creator, you will reach stages of development that will present new opportunities.\nMaybe you\u2019ll start podcasting full-time.\nMaybe you\u2019ll write a book (I am right now).\nMaybe you\u2019ll build a software (I am right now).\nThe most difficult part is gaining a foothold in the market during your first year or so.\nAfter that, your ideas and name have reached so many people that you cannot lose.\nThat\u2019s it for this one.\nTalk next week,\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "Comfort is an impermanent state of mind that humans love to call home.\nWhat\u2019s funny is that the longer we box ourselves into this mental house we refuse to leave, the more uncomfortable it gets.\nThe only path to true comfort is by reaching the level of mind that is comfortable with the inevitable discomfort that life presents.\nThe problem is this:\nWhen people are faced with discomfort, their automatic reaction is to flee, not fight.\nWe may not flee from the physical situation, but we attempt to run toward the mental comfort of a past experience. Our mind wants to move even when we are still.\nThis creates tension, and unless that tension is resolved it stays around longer than it should.\nThe result of this problem is distraction, feeling \u201clost,\u201d and getting stuck in a rut.\nWe don\u2019t know what to pursue next, because we lack the clarity that discomfort provides with time.\nWhen we are in this \u201clost\u201d or chaotic state of mind, it\u2019s impossible to see beyond the initial problem.\nWhy? Because it\u2019s begging to be solved.\nThe mind determines how we interact with reality.\nThe mind houses perspective houses perception houses behavior.\nFrom the top down, most people hold a narrow perspective that leads to a negative perception of a situation which dictates their mindless behavior.\nThe goal is to move through life with artfulness and grace.\nThat is, to be at one with the present moment regardless of how the mind wants to interpret the difficulty of the situation.\nWhen you:\nBroaden your perspective by approaching life with an open mind\nGain the power to accept situations as they are\nReap the joy that comes from progress\nYou come to the realization that you\u2019ve been sold a lie.\nThe conventional path is not the path to the good life.\nTo do this well, there are a few things you need to understand.\nThe 3 Perspectives\nThe space between expectation and reality creates tension that causes pain.\nI love philosophy, but realized fast that theory has to meet practice.\nKnowledge must be brushed up against reality, in more ways than one, to determine its validity.\nA philosopher can intellectualize all day, but can they run a business?\nHow do they react when they lose $100,000?\nWhat about when you start writing content, gain a follower, but lose 5 more?\nCan they create, keep, and nurture a relationship?\nOr are they just guessing about how to create a good one and promoting it as \u201cthe best path\u201d to those that learn from them?\nWhat about when their dog dies? How about their parents?\nActions must align with words.\nAn overweight health expert is a clear example of someone that is difficult to trust, but anyone can hide behind an anonymous online profile.\nThe best philosophy is that which is grounded in reality, and that is individual.\nI want to give 3 perspectives to help you realize the importance of reducing the space between expectation and reality, concept and experience, and what is and what isn\u2019t.\nExpectation VS Reality\nExpectations are beliefs, and our beliefs are often unconscious and conditioned into our mind as we go about life.\nAn expectation is a projection into the future.\nIt is the assumption that something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen.\nWestern children are often told they \u201cshould\u201d become a doctor, engineer, or some other high-paying job title.\nKids are told they \u201cwill\u201d go to Church on Sunday, and they believe it.\nExpectations narrow your mind toward a predictable future and prevent us from opening your mind to potential futures.\nFrom this narrow-minded state, our perspective is limited.\nSince our perspective is limited, so is our perception of the situation.\nWith an inaccurate perception, we often make choices that are inconducive to our ideal future.\nAnd choices are important, they create your future one brick at a time.\nLet\u2019s look at the example of hot weather and a sauna.\nWhen people think about going out in hot weather, they complain, because their expectation narrows their mind on a negative outcome.\nWhen people think about going to the sauna, it is intentional. Usually in alignment with a meaningful outcome.\nThe reality of the situation is the same, but the expectation is different, and that causes pain in the former situation.\nIn a more practical situation, let\u2019s look at someone with a lot of responsibility that wants to start a business.\nThey see others with little responsibility flexing their business success within 6-12 months.\nThey hold that expectation in your mind without context for their situation.\nThey conceptualize why they can\u2019t do the same and how life is unfair (because they have a job, kids, and a spouse).\nThey fail to face reality.\nAnd the reality is that they did not hop on the opportunity to build a business when they had less responsibilities, and that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no changing it, and the sooner you accept reality for what it is, the sooner you\u2019ll be able to start making progress.\nBecause once they do accept reality, they can approach that goal from a new lens, a more sustainable one.\nThey can search for aligned mentors, education, and strategies that will result in the same success, but on a longer time scale.\nThe only other option is to become a slave to your expectations and never reach that goal, going about life knowing it\u2019s possible, but complaining that you aren\u2019t able to achieve the same thing.\nConcept VS Experience\nConcepts can only be created from experience.\nThe prime example of this misunderstanding is that of God, The Universe, or whatever you want to call the higher power.\nReligious people attach to the concept of God but fail to realize that it is an experience. The concept is simply a symbolic representation of that experience.\nThe difference is knowing and understanding.\nConcepts allow you to know, experience allows you to understand.\nKnowledge is a layer on top of reality, understanding is an inherent aspect of human consciousness.\nOne an outward construction, the other an inward truth.\nConcept is the guide that must brush up against reality to be experienced.\nReality is experience, and that\u2019s all there is, if you\u2019re paying attention.\nPeople love to conceptualize because they can do so without moving forward in the world to solve problems (internal and external) that result in a less superficial and reactively emotional experience.\nWhat Is VS What Isn\u2019t\n\u201cIt is what it is\u201d is the most profound statement you will hear in your life, but few people realize the depth behind it.\nMaking a distinction between \u201cwhat is\u201d and \u201cwhat isn\u2019t\u201d is a great way to close the space between expectations and reality, as well as concept and experience.\nThe present moment, what\u2019s right in front of you, is \u201cwhat is.\u201d\nThe difficulty of the barbell in your hand is reality. The expectation that it should be easy is not.\nThe struggle of building a name for yourself is the experience. The concept of a fulfilling lifestyle in your mind isn\u2019t.\nAnd if you want to start this journey toward long-term success, enroll in the Digital Economics masterclass.\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that expectations, concepts, and \u201cwhat isn\u2019t\u201d are bad.\nThe main problem are the negative expectations, the concepts that \u201cknow\u201d and prevent you from action, and an inability to be at one with \u201cwhat is.\u201d\nThe Point\nWith all of these perspectives, the point is this:\nWhen life is difficult, overwhelming, or you feel that dreaded sense of despair about your future, there is a dissonance between expectation and reality.\nThe beliefs, ideas, or thoughts in your head do not match the present moment that is unfolding in front of you.\nAnd because you give them too much attention, they take priority over and mask your sensory perceptions.\nIn another word, you can clean your room, and you can clean it well, even if you don\u2019t feel like cleaning it.\nFeel free to exchange \u201cclean your room\u201d with any given activity.\nLevels Of Mind\nNo problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it. \u2013 Albert Einstein\nProblems are encoded in the system and few people can see them for what they are.\nProblems are what spark the gap between expectation and reality, and only once you can close that gap does that problem become effortless to solve.\nBut, in order to solve that problem and close that gap, you must reach a new level of mind.\nWe will define \u201cmind\u201d as how you interact with reality.\nMind, in this sense, is perspective.\nThink of perspective as a field that holds all expectations, beliefs, ideas, skills, experience, potentialities, and the rest.\nThe broader this perspective becomes, the more you increase your level of mind, and the more difficult it is to latch on to one expectation, belief, skill, etc.\nWith each problem you solve, the perceived difficulty of life goes down, and your level of mind goes up.\nThe degree of problems you face is a prime indicator of the stage of personal development you are in.\nAnd the degree of problems you can solve is the degree of problems you can solve for another.\nMeaning, the more you develop yourself, by taking on an ever-increasing level of challenge, the more experience you gain.\nThe challenges you face will you require to close the gap between expectation and reality many times, and each time you do, you will be presented with a lesson.\nThis experience can be transferred into business, as products solve problems, so the higher your experience, the more profitable your business becomes.\nThere must be a balance, as you would not try to climb Mount Everest when you can\u2019t even sustain a habit of 10K steps a day.\nLive At Your Edge \u2013 The Way To Mental Mastery\nAs you open yourself to living at your edge, your deepest purpose will slowly begin to make itself known. In the meantime, you will experience layer after layer of purposes, each one getting closer and closer to the fullness of your deepest purpose. \u2013 David Deida\nTo reach new levels of mind, you have to encounter problems.\nYou can\u2019t sit around, wasting away, doing the same thing over and over without regard for personal evolution.\nYou must live at the edge of skill and challenge.\nAs you solve problems, you increase your level of mind.\nIn order to solve problems, you must increase your level of skill.\n1) Pursue A Challenging Goal\nThis is a lesson in almost every single one of my newsletters.\nYou need a goal that you are working towards every. single. day.\nOne that will lead to your ideal future, even if you don\u2019t know what that future is.\nI can assume that it involves a healthy body, abundant bank account, and thriving relationships (with peace of mind being the byproduct of pursuing those goals, not necessarily achieving them).\nThis goal will be achieved, and you will have to set a new one (that may not be clear for a while) in order to prevent and dig yourself out of subsequent ruts.\n2) Remain Conscious Of The Present Moment Difficulty\nWhat judgments, connotations, and words do you associate with the words \u201cstruggle,\u201d \u201cdifficulty,\u201d or \u201chard?\u201d\nDo they lead to compulsive thoughts about a stressful future?\nMaybe they lead to a memory of a past mistake\u2026 one that causes fear to the point of inaction?\nOr maybe a mixture of both, leaving you in a vortex of anxiety?\nAgain, these are but expectations, concepts, and \u201cwhat isn\u2019ts\u201d that you hold in your mind.\nThey are not reality, and reality includes struggle, difficulty, and hardness. You can\u2019t escape them. And this requires radical acceptance of the present moment.\n3) Hit The Critical Point Of The Perception Threshold\nIf you have writer\u2019s block\u2026\nIf you\u2019re 30 minutes into a 5k run\u2026\nIf you\u2019re on your last rep of a 365lb squat\u2026\nIf you\u2019re hesitant to post your first piece of content\u2026\nIf you\u2019re 45 minutes into a meditation session and your mind is begging you to check your notifications\u2026\nThoughts and emotions will flood your mind, and \u201cthe only way out is through.\u201d\nYou must train your pain tolerance because the magic happens when you stick it out for just enough time to hit \u201cthe runner\u2019s high\u201d in any situation.\nThe Perception Threshold is the critical point after a period of struggle where what was once difficult becomes effortless due to a shift in how you perceive the situation.\nExpectations collapse into reality.\nConcepts collapse into experience.\nWhat isn\u2019t collapses into what is.\nThis may take 5 minutes, it may take 1 hour, and with problems that aren\u2019t immediately solvable, it may take years.\nChaos is a prerequisite to clarity, and clarity is the most potent fuel in this world.\n4) Reach A New Level Of Mind\nCrossing The Perception Threshold forces you to zoom out to a higher level of mind, or more holistic perspective beyond the narrow state you were in.\nFrom this level, you can accurately perceive your prior problem and see it for what it is.\n\u201cNot having ideas\u201d for your writing becomes a silly excuse.\nNot performing the last rep \u2013 that leads to the most gains \u2013 becomes \u201cI\u2019m being a little b*tch, push through.\u201d\nNot posting your first piece of content becomes, \u201cIf I don\u2019t do this, it becomes habit, and I\u2019ll be stuck in my current situation for life, which is the opposite of what I want.\u201d\nDeep satisfaction is the result.\n\u2013 Dan\nWhat Happened This Week\nI\u2019ve only got one thing for you.\nModern Mastery 2.0 has launched and is under contruction.\nLess bloat, less overwhelm, more value, more personalized help.\nOut of the 200+ articles and trainings, we will be adding more courses to be the education platform for the future of work.\nYouTube courses, design, editing, visual composition, marketing, product building, and everything you\u2019ll ever need.\nIf you\u2019re interested, readers can join for $5 here."

I financially destroyed myself to make my little eCommerce business work\u2026 and it failed miserably.\nThe third was in Costa Rica. After I hit a high in business revenue, I impulsively bought a flight to CR with my girlfriend at the time.\nThe true nature of our relationship was revealed, we broke things off and flew back the next day.\nAll of these experiences had one thing in common:\nMental turmoil.\nNot a slight increase in stress, but the kind where you feel trapped.\nThe smallest tasks turn into mountains of impossibility.\nEvery thought becomes an enemy that traps you in a mental game.\nThere ceases to be a light at the end of the tunnel, and you can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019ll ever get out.\nThese phases of life aren\u2019t fun, clearly.\nBut, these moments are when life offers a lesson that can only be found through a shift in direction.\nAll of these major struggles had a few things in common:\nAll progress-induced happiness was stripped from me, like an abrupt transition to a new movie scene after the climax.\nI felt lost and had little desire to sustain the progress of my previous purpose \u2013 I had achieved it and had to move forward.\nI experimented both inward and outward. I tried techniques for inner peace while creating new goals with accompanying education and practice.\nWith time, the pieces of the puzzle came together, brought clarity, and launched me into a new season of intensity.\nThis is what we are here to unpack.\nWhy does this matter?\nSo you can identify the point in life you are at, see the light at the end of the tunnel, and avoid treading water before you are too tired to get to shore.\nThe Balance Of Peace & Progress\nHappiness is a skill.\nIt is not given but created.\nNot deserved but earned.\nAs with all skills, it must be practiced, refined, and adopted as a part of your life.\nIf it doesn\u2019t belong in every day, week, or month of your present and future, why are you doing it?\nIf you want to become a writer, creator, or marketer \u2013 why are you not writing everyday? Even if you don\u2019t get paid at the start, you still have to build leverage, reputation, and authority to the point of getting paid.\nIf you want to learn high-impact writing (in a practical setting that helps you build leverage for the future of work) check out 2 Hour Writer.\nWhen isolated, happiness loses its meaning as it cannot exist without an unhappy reference point of prior experience.\nThis is the problem with the new age positivity movement.\nYou can think positive thoughts all day long. But what people fail to realize is that every positive thought holds a negative seed. This is why almost every great success comes after great failure.\nYou can think your way to a positive future, but the image of that future is forged through an equal and often more painful past.\nWithout a negative experience as an anchor, you have nothing meaningful to move toward.\nThere are two states of mind to become aware of:\nBeing and doing.\nPeace and progress.\nStillness and movement.\nWhen your attention is focused, without distraction, on either of these modalities of pure living, you tap into the power of the present moment.\nEveryone wants money, muscles, and a desirable partner.\nThe act of achieving those goals feels incredible\u2026 at the start.\nIf you don\u2019t have a philosophical sense of mastery behind your material pursuits, you are in for a rude awakening.\nEven if your actions don\u2019t change, the \u201cwhy\u201d behind them can.\nA bodybuilder that got started after a tough breakup can find meaning in the microcosm of life that weight training is \u2013 if they allow their mind to see beyond their identification with the material world.\nThose that do acquire their material desires change on the outside, but not the inside.\nMany people turn a physical 60 years old with the mind of a 12-year-old going through emotional puberty.\nThe main Buddhist teaching is that of impermanence.\nThat is, nothing can be isolated and held static by the mind.\nThis includes ideas, feelings, emotions, people, locations, and everything else that we label and expect to stay the same forever.\nThe identification with ideology, dogma, or other static mental constructs are the source of our suffering. When they are threatened, so is our happiness.\nThinking is not bad and often necessary when critical.\nBut when gone unchecked, compulsive thoughts can create a personal reality of inescapable turmoil.\nWhen one is still, their mind wants to move.\nWhen one is moving, their mind wants to be still.\nWithout deliberate practice, the mind will latch onto the past or future in an attempt to make the impermanent permanent.\nThis is the cause of unhappiness but is not to be demonized as that is against the point.\nWhen you feel unhappy, observe that feeling. Lean into it. Let it point \u201ca finger at the moon\u201d and present the lesson that life is trying to teach you. From that low, lean into the coming high.\nThe activities that create this blissful state of mind are personal. You must observe, hypothesize, experiment, fail, learn, and repeat this never-ending process even once you have reached objective success.\nBecause even that isn\u2019t permanent.\nSeasons Of Experimentation & Intensity\nThe secret is to engage the mind with the impermanence of life, not attempt to engage life with the mind\u2019s desire to make permanent.\nOf course, there are seasons of intensity that most of us have experienced:\nThe \u201cuniverse aligns,\u201d everything clicks, and you act on an idea that makes perfect sense.\nYou have clarity on your goals, reaching new levels of skill, and enjoying the process.\nYou feel a sense of purpose. It seems like there isn\u2019t enough time in the day, but you wouldn\u2019t change it for a thing.\nThe feeling of pure progress is unmatched.\nNo distractions, absolute clarity, placing one, two, three bricks down to build your vision for the future.\nIt would make sense to fill our days with more activities that result in this experience.\nLife\u2019s seasons of intensity aren\u2019t the problem.\nThey happen naturally after a season of experimentation.\nThat is where the problem lies for most people.\nThey don\u2019t perceive the dreadful, negative, and hopeless period of feeling lost as an opportunity.\nIf you can master your mind in these periods of struggle, the negative ceases to induce suffering.\nInstead, you prime yourself to launch into a new season of progress.\nThe Purpose Of Experimentation\nSelf-experimentation is the only way to solve your problems for good.\nPeople can diagnose and prescribe a solution to your problems, but that lacks regard for the difference in perspective, goals, and experience from those prescribing the solutions.\nLet\u2019s imagine that you are feeling low energy.\nYou come across a post on social media that has confidence and conviction in the diet advice they give (this can also be applied to the problem of little money and specific business models).\nYou are in search of a solution, they tell you that veganism will solve all of your problems, and from an unenlightened state you:\nClean up your diet\nFollow their advice as if it were law\nSee the results they mentioned\nThen, you attach to that diet ideology and become a prophet. You attribute results, that others have gotten via different modalities, to veganism and demonize anyone that questions you.\nThis is dangerous, obviously, and is the definition of low consciousness.\nIn reality, what happened is independent of veganism:\nYou ate more nutrient-dense foods\nYour actions worked to survive your vegan identity\nYou had clarity (not chaos) by following a disciplined nutrition regimen\nVeganism, in this case, was simply a modality for ordering your mind (sustained degree of flow state) and allowing you to follow the principles of health \u2013 but you attributed it to a method.\nNow, if you were to try veganism for a month, carnivore for a month, keto for a month, and flexible dieting for a month, you would:\nMake connections between the diets to reveal the fundamentals of health (pattern recognition = dopamine).\nPick and choose certain methodologies that you enjoy, meaning they will bring sustainable results.\nRefine a system that fits your individual nature to perfection.\nThen, once healthy living becomes effortless, you can do the same for your finances, social life, romantic relationships, spiritual endeavors, or any other domain of life.\nIf you\u2019re going through problems in your relationship, hire a therapist, watch a YouTube guru, go on a retreat, and experiment with options until you find the right solution.\nIf your business isn\u2019t growing, buy a course, hire a coach, test a new software, zoom out, and create a new strategy\u2026\nThere\u2019s always a way to solve your problems, and you strip yourself of that power when you latch onto one solution (that probably won\u2019t solve the problem for good).\nSelf-experimentation is the open-minded process of creating, not finding, the solution to the endless problems in your life.\nNote for creators and solopreneurs: this is how you create a unique, holistic product or service that markets itself in a saturated market.\nWe don\u2019t need more specialists, we need holistic synthesizers that create new systems with accompanying nuanced education.\nExperiment Inward\nYou feel lost because you don\u2019t have a system to maintain a baseline level of clarity.\nWhen you enter a new chapter of life, clarity creation should be top priority.\nThat alone will order consciousness to the point of feeling a sense of control over your future.\nTo go inward, the main techniques you will be experimenting with are that of immaterial pursuits:\nPhilosophy, spirituality, or emotional intelligence.\nThe techniques you can experiment with include but are not limited to:\nReading\nMeditation\nObservation\nSelf-inquiry\nContemplation\nLong quiet walks\nThese activities engage your attention with the present moment.\nAs with all skills, you improve by progressive overload.\nThat is, by gradually increasing the level of challenge so that you don\u2019t get bored or anxious. Bored because the challenge is too low, anxious because the challenge is too high.\nThe goal with inward experimentation is to incorporate one of these activities into your daily or weekly routine.\nThe practice must be sustained, lifelong, and on the path of mastery if you wish to maintain the benefits that come from these pursuits.\nExperiment Outward\nThe reason you feel lost is that you lost connection with a purpose, goal, or routine that brought order to your life.\nWhen you end a chapter in your life, you may not want the same things you previously did. This is a good thing. It means you are growing.\nBut, nobody wants to be stuck in that period of feeling lost for too long, and there is only one path out:\nStay mindful of hints at a new purpose, and don\u2019t let the lessons of life pass you by.\nSet a goal so that you can perceive life situations through the lens of that goal (again, pattern recognition = dopamine = collecting puzzle pieces until the image is clear)\nIdentify the gap between you and your goals and note problems standing in the way.\nStudy, build, and experiment in alignment with that goal.\nWhat is the most pressing problem in your life right now?\nIs it self-esteem? Money? Lack of fulfillment?\nSit with this thought and contemplate.\nNow, are you able to work towards solving that problem now, or do you have to solve another one?\nIf you lack money and don\u2019t have the time to start a business, then clearly you shouldn\u2019t start a business. You either need to experiment with budgeting or get a new job.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a boy/girlfriend, are you in the financial, physical, and spiritual position to sustain a relationship? If not, solve the other problems first.\nOnce you identify a goal you can pursue, research, and experiment with techniques that will allow you to reach it.\nIf you need guidance and education around building a high-performance lifestyle, starting an interest-based business, and joining a supportive community (where you might meet your next business partner), check out Modern Mastery \u2013 readers can join for $5.\nMaintain New Baselines\nAs you progress through a season of experimentation, clarity begins to culminate.\nSoon enough the final piece will click into place, you will launch into a season of intensity, and reach new highs in the respective domain of life.\nLike hitting a monthly high in business revenue.\nBut, stay mindful that this season will come to an end.\nSimilar to bulking and cutting in bodybuilding, you can only \u201cbulk\u201d for so long before you gain too much fat. You start to feel groggy, slow, and uncertain if you should keep pushing.\nWhen it comes time to \u201ccut,\u201d and without a proper system, you may lose a lot of the muscle you gained.\nWe don\u2019t want that.\nAs you are turning the final page, make an effort to separate signal from noise.\nDouble down on the techniques, tasks, and actions that will maintain your a new baseline of \u201cmuscle\u201d acquired.\nThe entirety of this process of:\nExperimenting to solve your problems\nGaining clarity on a new chapter in life\nPushing to new highs and systemizing the process to maintain results\nIs the essence of life.\nIn fact, it\u2019s just another perspective of the scientific method.\nDo what you will with this information.\nI am but another human that pursued a goal, figured it out, and am passing down what I learn.\nI would encourage you to do the same.\n\u2013 Dan"

        "content": "When I was a child, I felt alone. I was a rebel.\nI questioned almost everything that I was told to do whether it be going to church, after-school sports, or a 4-year college.\nI am grateful for my programming, because it allowed me to get a leg up on my peers who listened and obeyed without question.\nFormal education has its place, but people are losing trust in its ability to secure their future.\nI would argue that they never had trust in its ability to secure a fulfilling future\u2026 But the option of \u2018forging your own path\u2019 seems even more uncertain. Why? Because it requires you to create certainty, not wait for someone else\u2019s creation to be laid in front of you.\nPeople inherently know that life enjoyment is a personal choice, but nobody wants to face that reality, so they outsource their quality of life to the exaggerated promises of schools and jobs.\nIt\u2019s all too common for someone to spend 4-12 years and tens of thousands of dollars just to be placed in low-salary jobs that require a fraction of what they were taught in school.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. Students often have to self-educate on the side if they want to advance in their career \u2013 so why not do that from the start?\nThe education system has its benefits, as all things do, but for those that want fulfilling work and an open schedule, a glorified piece of paper called a \u201cdegree\u201d isn\u2019t going to get you there.\nIt will be a stepping stone at best or a financial chain at worst.\nAfter 5 years and 20 thousand dollars down the drain (with 2 more years to complete my degree), I was fed up.\nThere was a lot on the line, and the thought of getting a job was the bane of my existence.\nI knew I could acquire the skill to avoid that reality.\nI\u2019m exaggerating here, of course.\nJobs are often a necessary step \u2013 but my conceptual survival was at stake.\nI identified as someone who would never get a job, and my obsessive work reflected that. (I ended up getting a job, didn\u2019t like that. It made me work 10x harder to get out).\nIn my final year, I took a class on basic computer programming.\nThis was the first class I was genuinely interested in after 4 years of trial and error.\nIt interested me so much that I spent 3-4 hours a day studying outside of class with online courses.\nThis is when the reality of formal education slapped me in the face.\nWithin 2 weeks, I learned the entirety of the college course curriculum through self-study on the internet.\nI stopped going to class but still aced the tests.\nThe New Rich\nWe are in the middle of a massive shift.\nBut, this shift is not limited to money.\nThe New Rich isn\u2019t about billions, mansions, and cars.\n(I\u2019m not saying these are bad. They can be useful goals for exposing yourself to life experience and developing a sense of mastery behind the skills used to get there).\nThe New Rich is about leveraging technology for fulfilling work, empty schedules, and individual choice.\nLet\u2019s break each down for the sake of awareness.\nThis section isn\u2019t \u201chyper-actionable\u201d and for good reason. You have to have the awareness of an idea before you can actualize it.\nHold each of these in your mind and correct your daily actions in alignment with them:\nTechnology\nThe internet has democratized wealth generation for the self-educated and self-reliant.\nThe internet allows you to learn skills that schools don\u2019t teach, which are often the skills that lead to an irreplaceable income. If everyone is learning it, it\u2019s replaceable. (But, don\u2019t let a small internet echo chamber make you think that everyone is learning these modern skills, they aren\u2019t.)\nYou need to invest time / money into education that won\u2019t lead to a static salary.\nLearn skills like marketing, sales, writing, and social media. Use those skills to build a one-person business.\nUse no-code tools to create a service with your skill set, get results, and productize as you build an audience.\nInvest time to get results. Use results as leverage.\nFulfilling Work\nAnyone can be happy, even the sheep, but fulfillment is a different story.\nYou need a purpose, or else you will be assigned one.\nLife is not kind to those that don\u2019t know what they want out of it.\nBut, this doesn\u2019t happen in an instant.\nObserve the masses and realize what you don\u2019t want.\nThis will help you gain clarity on what you do want.\nYou need something to work towards, that will influence your daily decisions. The other option is to work towards someone else\u2019s dreams for the sake of survival via paycheck.\nEmpty Schedules\nWith 1-2 years of fulfillment-directed effort by leveraging the internet, you will have control over your time, income, location, and lifestyle.\nYou won\u2019t have a boss maintaining order in your daily schedule.\nYou will have to do that yourself.\n8-hour workdays, endless screen time, and little movement are antagonists to human psychology and physiology.\nYou may not notice its ramifications if it is your normalized state of being. Control over your lifestyle allows you to realign with nature and feel superhuman.\nIndividual Choice\nWithout autonomy, your choices are automatic for the sake of survival.\nThey stem from following the \u201csecure\u201d path that has been laid out for you.\nLiving in a constant state of survival is the cause of unnecessary stress.\nStress keeps your mind narrow.\nIt is difficult to make time for development, spirituality, and creativity if your choices are chained to a paycheck.\nIt\u2019s not instant, as all good things aren\u2019t, but creating an independent source of income is a necessity for those that want full control over their life.\nBecome A Digital Renaissance Man\nThe state of work has seen big changes since the pandemic.\nSpecialists are out, but so are generalists.\nNow, they aren\u2019t \u201cout\u201d entirely, of course.\nYou will be considered a specialist at times, a generalist at others. This is what the normal world runs on, but we aren\u2019t here to be normal.\nSpecialist freelancers still have a cap on their income due to a lack of productization. Generalist agencies that can\u2019t get above-average results for 95% of their clients.\nWe live in a time of specialized generalism.\nThat is to say, the highest-paid individuals are the ones that use the creative ability of their mind to focus on a specific, profitable problem to deliver above-average results.\nThe more skills you acquire and the more interests you research, the more awareness you have of the intersections of those domains.\nYou can pull from that experience to laser in on a problem related to any of those skills, interests, or combinations of both.\nThis has only become a possibility over the last decade thanks to the development of the internet.\nHistory repeats itself, and we are cycling through a time where creatives, visionaries, and strategists have the resources available to them to thrive.\nAcquire Evergreen Skills\nWe\u2019ve already discussed the $1 Million Dollar Skill Stack in previous letters.\nSo, to keep this brief, make it your purpose to obsess over marketing, sales, writing, and speaking.\nIf you have no idea what skills to commit your time to, make it these. Writing in a real-world setting to gain experience will teach you more than reading endless books.\nThey all intersect, but they are necessary for any form of independent income generation.\nTo become a Digital Renaissance Man (or Woman), you will be learning a variety of skills and interests that pique your curiosity.\nThe evergreen skills allow you to package up and distribute those skills in a profitable manner.\nA few YouTube videos will suffice in learning the fundamentals of these skills (don\u2019t ask for recommendations, just go learn).\nAfter, you must learn to apply those skills to whatever path you choose.\nIf you want to start freelancing or coaching, consider Modern Mastery. If you want a masterclass of systems on becoming a creator (the embodiment of the Renaissance Man) consider Digital Economics.\nCourses aren\u2019t necessary if you make the time to study, experiment, and fail. But, they are obviously helpful for those that want to streamline their efforts from somebody who has already done it.\nPersonal Interests\nWhat seems to be the only difference between the successful and mediocre in this age is choice of consumption.\nIn one camp we have the distracted.\nThey scroll without intention. No goals to focus their efforts.\nIn the other camp, we have the obsessed.\nThey research the interests that align with their future goals.\nThose that are committed to building a physique of vitality and strength keep their finger on the pulse of the health industry.\nSimilar to those on their path to financial freedom. They are constantly experimenting with new methods \u2013 without attachment \u2013 to grow their brand.\nThe obsessed allow the roots of their mind to dig into the specific crevice of reality they cannot stop researching.\nWhen this process is repeated over the years with new skills and interests, they open room for creative problem-solving.\nCreative Problem Solving\n1% of 50 years is 6 months, and most people can\u2019t commit to the uncertain path for more than 2 weeks.\nAll of this takes time, a lot of time, and anyone that says otherwise isn\u2019t looking out for your best interest. Only you can do that.\nAs you are pushing the boundaries of the known, finding fulfillment in the challenging problems that present themselves, and shining the light of awareness in the unknown, you increase the volume of your domain of mastery.\nHere\u2019s a thought experiment.\nThere are 4 small circles that form the outline of a square, each of them in four corners. These circles represent health, wealth, relationships, and happiness; the four eternal markets.\nThese are where all burning, and profitable, problems exist.\nAs you develop yourself within these domains, the circles increase in diameter until they begin to overlap like a venn diagram.\nEach of these circles can be considered a field of awareness. You are aware of the problems within each domain and are able to piece together a creative solution from your experience.\nLet\u2019s set those aside for a minute and create a new set of circles.\nThis time, they represent the evergreen skills: writing, speaking, marketing, and sales.\nThe same thing happens. As you cultivate these skills, awareness overlaps and you can solve problems at the intersections while specialists are focused on one small circle.\nNext, apply the same thing to results-oriented skills like social media, email marketing, graphic design, or programming.\nAs you learn one, two, three, or four applicable skills, because improvement never ends since entropy never sleeps, you begin to compound your creative problem-solving abilities.\nWe now have 3 sets of overlapping circles.\nThe last piece of this puzzle is personal interests.\nMost people never have the thought of making a living doing what they love because they are missing awareness of the eternal markets, evergreen skills, and results-oriented skills that allow you to navigate the business landscape.\nNow, any of the above can be considered personal interests of yours. Curiosity is powerful, and I would be disappointed if those skills did not excite you for a potential future. But, we can create one last square of circles that represents your personal interests.\nIn my case, I gravitated toward spirituality, philosophy, metaphysics, and human potential.\nWhen I connect this last piece to the other 3 sets of squares we\u2019ve created, it forms a three-dimensional cube, like a forcefield of connection.\nWe can place a problem in the middle of that cube, navigate the outer edges for creative firepower, and piece together a unique solution that may one day be worth millions of dollars.\nMoney, of course, is a byproduct of your life\u2019s work.\nMoney matters, but there is a way to find meaning in this fabricated resource.\nYour personal interests can be anything. Do not outsource your curiosity to me. The antagonist to your story is distraction and you must guard your mind.\nNothing happens, then everything happens.\nWhen the outer edges of your multi-dimensional fields of awareness touch, it\u2019s like the missing piece of an infinite puzzle.\nAt first, you can\u2019t tell what the image is, but once the right piece clicks into place, you solidify a leap in understanding.\nWhen the image of the puzzle is clear, you can observe the story of others, identify their missing piece, and help them fill the gap.\nThis is the path of the Digital Renaissance man.\nThey replace distraction with education, and while sustaining that habit, make focused effort toward helping others as you develop those skills.\nFree, paid, in public, or in private. Freelancing, coaching, content creation, or whatever method you want to use to get your abilities in front of the world.\nSkill must be tested with challenge.\nIf you do not make an effort to create with your skills as you acquire them, you are not acquiring skills.\nThat\u2019s it.\nLearn, act, repeat, and don\u2019t let your mind get trapped in a thought loop of things that don\u2019t matter.\n\u2013 Dan\nWhen you\u2019re ready, here\u2019s how I can help you.\n2-Hour Writer gives you a real-world approach to creative writing.

        "content": "I\u2019ve avoided writing this letter for quite some time.\nI\u2019ve never felt \u201cready,\u201d and I still don\u2019t, but I know that writing about it will help clarify my thoughts.\nI hope those thoughts can be beneficial to you.\nReligion is like politics in the sense that when people disagree with your views, they have an unconscious emotional reaction where they spew pre-programmed words that they\u2019ve been fed since birth.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that religion and politics bring certainty to an uncertain future. From a psychological lens, that\u2019s why people outsource their free thinking to those ideological structures; to order their minds and prevent a decline into chaos.\nWhen one\u2019s views are threatened, they have a physical survival response like that of a mouse in the grips of a snake.\nSo, they reinforce their identity as they always have, close themselves off to truth (which is ironic), and never open their mind beyond the pre-rational stage of development.\nI would encourage you to keep an open mind when reading this letter, and if you can\u2019t, please unsubscribe. I\u2019m not asking you to adopt my beliefs, I\u2019m asking you to challenge your own.\nI was raised a Latter-Day Saint, some people know this ideology as \u201cMormonism.\u201d\nEvery Sunday, I would dress up in black slacks, a pure white shirt, and my favorite tie that my dad gave me.\nIt started in Sunday school, where kids under the age of 12 would sing hymns like \u201cI Am A Child Of God\u201d and go into a lesson from the Bible or Book Of Mormon.\nAt age 12, the boys became deacons. At 14, teachers. At 16, priests. All with increasing responsibilities in the priesthood.\nWe went on temple trips, performed baptisms for the dead, and attended \u201cseminary;\u201d a one-hour block of religious schooling before getting dropped off at public school.\nI had great experiences in the church, like boy scouts and the week-long multi-season adventures associated with it. There are some incredible people that subscribe to the belief system, but I was always skeptical.\nThe teachings failed to make logical, scientific, or realistic sense when you questioned them without getting scared of what you might find.\nDuring my time in the church, I was blessed to have the internet available to me.\nI let my curiosity pull me down rabbits of Christian, Catholic, Muslim, and even atheist ideologies so I could learn what they were all about.\nI went with my high school friends to their respective churches on Sunday, kept an open mind, observed, and questioned.\nI was able to note patterns, but they still lacked sense-making. At the time, I was not okay with the same blanket answer to every philosophical question I asked:\n\u201cJust have faith.\u201d\nSomehow I knew that holding the same beliefs for the entirety of my life would not serve me well.\nAnd over the past 10 years observing my former churchmates (thanks Facebook), I was correct.\nEgo Development & The Pre-Trans Fallacy\nThe difference between a theist, atheist, and spiritualist, in that order, is self-development.\nConsider the \u201cself\u201d and \u201cego\u201d synonymous for the rest of this letter.\nYou don\u2019t get rid of your ego, you develop it to the point or being at one with reality.\nYou don\u2019t develop your ego by trying to answer the impossible question of \u201cwho am I?\u201d but instead, asking the question \u201cwho am I not?\u201d until you are left with nothing but pure consciousness.\nIn my quest for meaning, I came across three incredible resources:\nThe 9 Stages Of Ego Development by Susan Cook Greuter, summarized by Actualized.Org (link)\nThe AQAL Model of human consciousness evolution by Ken Wilber\nThe Spiral Dynamics evolutionary model of individuals, organizations, and societies\nThese are all models for mapping individual and collective psyche development.\nThere is way too much to distill in one letter, so I encourage you to explore them in your own time.\nBut, one model from Ken Wilber helps explain the stages of spiritual development.\nIt is called the Pre-Trans Fallacy.\nIn short, think of it like the bell curve meme that was popular last year:\nIf you are struggling to find direction in your search for meaning, understanding, and God, this model can help.\nThe Pre-Trans Fallacy does not only apply to religion. It applies to development in any domain.\nIt states that people often mistake the pre-rational stage of development for being post-rational because neither represents the rational stage.\nWe are using religion as an example, and the easiest way to illustrate this concept is the belief in God.\nA biblical Christian\u2019s notion of God is vastly different from a mystic\u2019s notion of God.\nFrom the outside looking in, they look like they are saying the same thing because they are not atheistic.\nThey are not the same, let\u2019s break down why:\nThe Pre-Rational Stage\nFor this letter, we will be using Christianity as an example, because that is what I have experience with in the most extreme form.\nBut, this can be applied to any ideology, religious or not.\nI see these patterns reflect in business as well.\nLike how pockets of the internet believe in the \u201cbest\u201d outreach, content, or branding strategies without room for improvement.\nIn reality, the most developed individuals take the principles, move through the stages, and create their own methods to see the desired end result that any domain points at. For business it\u2019s money, for religion it\u2019s meaning, for health it\u2019s health.\nWithout questioning your own beliefs, you close yourself off to novel discoveries, innovations, and the things that will bring true progress to your life and the world.\nThe individuals, organizations, and societies in this pre-rational stage are best described as \u201cbible thumpers.\u201d\nThe spirituality of this stage is highly material.\nThey think heaven and hell are literal places where \u201cyou\u201d (which is a concept, the self) are blessed with virgins or tortured with fire.\nAny form of feedback is taken as a threat.\nThey lash out with the same words they\u2019ve been parroting since they were indoctrinated into that belief system.\nThe real problem is that the people in this stage close their minds to higher stages of development.\nThey can\u2019t view and interpret reality for what it is.\nNote: I do not aim to paint any religious ideology as bad. There are deep truths that can be found through study. The problem is the belief that these truths are limited to one lens of understanding these truths.\nThe Rational Stage\nThe rational stage is one that I know well.\nIt is the stereotypical atheist that rejects any and all notion of a higher power.\nThey lean on scientific discoveries to prove what is real from what\u2019s not. If it can\u2019t be scientifically proven, it is not true, according to this stage.\nThis is the stage where false skepticism begins to take over.\nAtheists \u201cquestion everything,\u201d as they should, but fail to question their own beliefs. Instead, they horde debate-worthy information that disproves the existence of God.\nThey can see through the blatant flaws of the pre-rational stage, but have not opened their mind to the flaws of their own. They think they have, and that\u2019s what prevents them from going deeper.\nOne thing to understand here is that most people go through all 3 stages of development.\nIf you are in the rational or pre-rational stage, you won\u2019t make an immediate leap to the next stage. It requires time and ego development.\nThe Trans Rational Stage\nIn the trans-rational stage, belief in God returns, but not the static image of a man in the sky.\nThis is where eastern philosophy, mysticism, and the labels associated with spirituality come into play.\nI do not want to do this stage injustice, as it is difficult to explain to those that lack the mental capacity for higher-level understanding (this isn\u2019t meant to be an insult, nor do I believe that people in this stage are \u201cabove\u201d others in the context of status, this isn\u2019t about status).\nInstead, I will attempt to point a finger at God. I would encourage you to use this as a way for you to notice and understand this higher power in your everyday life.\nHow To Find God\nHe who knows himself knows God. \u2013 Clement Of Alexandria\nFirst, let\u2019s make a distinction between \u201cconcept\u201d and \u201creality.\u201d\nA concept is a label for an aspect of reality that we hold as static in our minds.\nThey are useful, but not law. Reality flows like a river, a concept is a snapshot of that river.\nThis introduces the Buddhist principle of impermanence.\nThat is, nothing can be isolated and held static by the mind. A thought, idea, concept, ideology, person, item, community, emotion, and anything else that we process with our mind and expect to stay the same.\nAs an example, how we interpret what we see is determined by our perspective at the time, and our perspective is influenced by our state of mind.\nThe ego perpetuates this issue. It doesn\u2019t want to change.\nIf I am angry and have little experience with business, and I see a post from a billionaire about money\u2026 you can guess the outcome.\nI will form a concept of who that billionaire is in my mind (after reading one of their posts) and solidify that concept with my beliefs.\n\u201cHe had rich parents.\u201d\n\u201cHe got lucky, I could never do that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he give his money to charity? Doesn\u2019t he have enough?\u201d\nEven if you don\u2019t say these things, your ego does.\nThe ego creates barriers, limitations, and fabricated stories that veil reality. It prevents you from seeing things as they are by filling in the blanks of the static image your ego is attempting to construct.\nIn reality, you formed your entire opinion of another human being on a post that composes 0.0000000000001% of their contributions in life.\nEveryone has the desire to be free, and that\u2019s important.\nSome would say it\u2019s the inner voice of a higher power.\nAll that freedom is when pertaining to the mind, is the dissolution of barriers that comes from adopting a higher perspective.\nWhen you adopt a higher perspective, you can start to see things for what they are.\nThis is the lesson of all spiritual teachings.\nPatterns Of God\nTeotl, Brahman, Infinity, Source, The Universe, and more are all perspectives of God.\nTeotl in Aztec Philosophy is defined as, \u201ca single, vivifying, eternally self-generating and self-regenerating sacred power, energy, or force.\u201d\nIn short, this is \u201cspirit.\u201d\nBrahman in Buddhism is defined as, \u201cthe ultimate reality underlying all phenomena\u2026 Brahman is formless but is the birthplace of all forms in visible reality.\u201d\nInfinity or Source are other common lenses used by those that choose to understand God in that way.\nThey are all pointing toward the same thing, and that thing can\u2019t be captured and isolated as a religious ideology.\nI mean\u2026 it can and has been, but as minds have slowly started to open over the last century, these constructs have been questioned, and for good reason.\nThe Universe\nMy favorite way of illustrating this formless power is through the lens of The Universe.\nUniverse = uni-verse = one-song.\nAn infinite song that has highs, lows, harmonies of multiple instruments, rising actions, climaxes, falling actions, and a chorus.\nThis pattern reflects in human sense-making.\nHumans make sense of the world via stories, and we become obsessed with games because they are stories with interactive challenges that narrow our attention.\nThe problem is that we try to make sense of a note, lyric, instrument, or musician on it\u2019s own without regard for the big picture.\nIf you isolate a part of the story, especially a negative one, you\u2019re going to have a bad time. Unless you zoom out to see the story unfolding before your eyes.\nLet\u2019s run through a story of the self-generation and self-regeneration of rain:\nImagine the ocean or a large body of water. The heat from the sun evaporates that water, dividing it into many microscopic droplets.\nThose droplets rise and reunify as clouds. These clouds grow in size and unify as larger clouds.\nSoon, droplets unify in the clouds until they are heavy enough to rain back down to Earth.\nRain creates puddles, fills streams, and works it\u2019s way through other ecological processes.\nEventually, the rain makes its way back to the ocean with time and the process is repeated.\nThis is not a localized phenomenon of division and unity.\nIt is infinite.\nThe ideas in your mind divide and reunite, we call this creativity.\nThroughout human history, races have divided and are now reunifying.\nFrom a universal perspective, your opinions do not matter about this, nor do mine.\nThe barriers of race have been questioned and fought against until people were able to mate with whomever they please. This, of course, is not the driving force behind all of this.\nIn some time from now, all of our skin may be the same slight shade of what humans perceive as brown, and race as a concept will collapse into one.\nWhat about the chapters of your life? You\u2019ve gone through highs and lows. You\u2019ve gained friends and lost friends. You\u2019ve changed, even if you\u2019re mind has attached to an image of yourself from the past.\nI would encourage you to notice these pattern wherever you can, even when making your breakfast, writing a book, or using the bathroom.\nThis is how you find God in your everyday life. By seeing beyond the surface and appreciating the depth behind your mechanical pre-programmed actions (and yes, those mechanical actions can be praising a surface-level image of God, which seems against the point).\nNotice the parts, wholes, and how they dance together across the physical globe and ripple through the collective consciousness.\nThe Practicality Of God\nYou are probably asking, \u201cHow in the world is this practical to my life?\u201d\nOne, because this isn\u2019t \u201cyour\u201d life.\nThis isn\u2019t about your selfish narrow perspective. You are meant to open your mind beyond that.\nTwo, does this not fascinate you? The depth behind what you perceive as mundane, \u201cnormal,\u201d actions?\nThere is more beyond the surface of material, status, and words.\nYou are a part of something much bigger, and that can only be seen through spirit.\nBy doing this, it reveals that the concepts, beliefs, and ideals we hold so dear are not static.\nWhen we identify with these mentally constructed entities and regard them as unchanging, we are in for a world of emotional trouble that prevents personal and collective progress.\nThe open-minded flow with the Universe, the closed-minded force the Universe to flow with them.\nIf the closed-minded are the barriers to true progress, then the open-minded have an obligation to raise them up.\nOne of the most beneficial habits you can adopt is playing with mental legos.\nSit with an idea, thought, or problem and follow the connections that present themselves.\nStay vigilant of egoic distractions.\nThis is how you practice creativity, mindfulness, and deep thinking without any external tools or guides.\nThe big problem on the cultural, social, and personal planes of existence is identification with ideology.\nHumans group ideas into what is supposed to be indivisible unity of ideas.\nWe leave no room for division and reunification. We leave no room for God.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhen You\u2019re Ready, Here\u2019s How I Can Help You\nThe first Solopreneur Sprints starts in 3 days.

        "content": "I\u2019m an introvert at heart.\nWhen I went to college, I was never the first to engage in conversation. My friend group (that I still have to this day) kinda just stumbled on me and we hit it off.\nDon\u2019t even get me started about speaking in front of the class.\nOr going to \u201cnetworking\u201d meetups to get to know high-value people.\nI wanted none of it.\nAll I wanted to do was sit in my dorm, play video games, and work on my side business. Which at the time was a fitness YouTube channel.\nThis was before I realized that introversion isn\u2019t about being anti-social. Being social is a skill, not a personality trait, yet people hide behind their \u201cintroverted\u201d identity to avoid the unavoidable discomfort required to see any form of success.\nThat was college, but now we\u2019re at the center of a new party\u2026 social media.\nI tried to build a name for myself many times in the past.\nFirst with a YouTube channel.\nSecond with an Instagram photography and art page (you can find this if you scroll allllll the way down to the bottom of my Instagram).\nThird was building multiple agencies and eCommerce brands with a variety of marketing tactics on social media.\nThen I stumbled across Twitter.\nYes, Twitter, of all places to break into the social media scene.\nI\u2019d been on Twitter before, but I thought it was a place for politics and half-baked memes that I could find on Reddit.\nBut, one day a post from Jose Rosado popped up on my timeline.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what it was, but it was some harsh truth around self-improvement.\nAnd I loved it.\nI followed Jose, and realized that he talked about online business as well, another thing I was interested in. (Another reason to incorporate more of your interests and not be a hyper-niche robot!)\nBy following him, other accounts started popping up on my timeline and before I knew it, I was drowning in high-value \u201cMoney Twitter\u201d posts.\nI lurked, without engaging, for about 6 months. I was seeing some success with my freelance business at the time, so the tips from these accounts were extremely helpful.\nOut of nowhere, a thought popped into my head:\n\u201cI can write all of these same tweets. Why am I just sitting here scrolling while others are clearly getting leads, sales, and having fun writing about their other interests?\u201d\nThat question changed the direction of my life.\nQuick note: Solopreneur Sprints starts in a little over a week (February 7th). Check it out here if you want help creating your niche, writing impactful content, and creating a growth strategy.\nThe Digital World Has No Barriers\nIn the past, the only way to the top was through your network.\nYou couldn\u2019t just DM a celebrity with a skillful message and get them to pay you 4 figures for a service (this is an overly optimal case).\nYou had to go to school.\nGet good grades.\nApply to a prestigious college that may require you to change geographic location.\nAnd be \u201cextroverted\u201d enough to network your way up the ladder until you meet someone with the perfect opportunity.\nBig opportunities were limited to the people that worked their ass off to get them.\nNow, opportunities are abundant.\nThat tweet you just scrolled by? They need a video editor.\nThat person you found in the comments? They want to learn how to be happy.\nThat video you never saw because it was buried by YouTube\u2019s algorithm? It gave exact steps to starting a freelance business if you had the persistence to make it work.\nThe internet gives you access to the 4.9 billion people that have access to it.\nAll it takes is one piece of content to be spread to the right corner for the right person to see it, reach out to you, and pay you for the value you have to offer.\nOf course, this becomes easier as you grow an audience that shares your content, so we don\u2019t want to rely on that at the start.\nNetworking \u2013 even though I hate that word \u2013 is the pillar of my digital success.\nJose Rosado was one of the first people I reached out to.\nWe hit it off, he helped share my content, and I ended up investing in his coaching program (this was ~3 years ago).\nJose and I have different views on online business now, but that\u2019s the point. We each have unique paths to share, and both of them hold valuable experiences that others can learn from.\nAnother example is Joey Justice, one of my best friends (that I\u2019m flying across the country to see for another time this year).\nI met Joey with a group of other people trying to grow their brand at the time. We strategized, shared each other\u2019s content, and worked together to refine the skills we wanted to get paid for.\nLast year, I moved to Texas with Dakota Robertson and JK Molina.\nI also met big players like Justin Welsh, Sahil Bloom, and Dickie Bush.\nAll in all, it\u2019s safe to say that consistent and targeted networking with people that you like is how you break into the social media game (and sustain growth).\nIf you aren\u2019t networking, you\u2019ve already lost.\nAsk any creator that actually has consistent account growth (and doesn\u2019t get stuck in a bitter cycle of hating the game) if networking is important.\nIf they don\u2019t attribute it to being the #1 thing that helped their growth, it would be wise not to trust them.\nThe Power Of The DM\nDMs are how you get in front of anyone on the internet.\nEspecially if you don\u2019t have an audience yet.\nFreelancers understand this for landing clients, but what about building a leverageable audience along the way so you aren\u2019t left with nothing when you decide to pivot?\nI\u2019ve seen people land jobs, have tweets go viral with few followers, and gain hundreds if not thousands of fans from doing this.\nPeople usually fall into one of two camps:\nThey don\u2019t understand the sheer power and network effect of DMing people on a consistent basis.\nThey don\u2019t understand that you can get large accounts to share your posts (if you are strategic enough).\nDMs are how you network, grow, and get eyes on your content as a beginner (or whenever you want to get more traffic to your content).\nBut, most people suck at DMs.\nSeriously. It\u2019s a problem.\nNever, and I repeat never ever ever expect a response if all you send is:\nHi or hey\nHow are you\nCan you follow me back\nA straight sales pitch with no prior connection\nA long block of text that takes too much time to read (especially if the sentences aren\u2019t spaced out)\nYou have to approach DMs tactically. Especially if you are reaching out to a big account that gets 10+ DMs an hour and probably doesn\u2019t check them (they usually skim over them to see if there is anything important).\nAgain, put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes and think for a second. How can you stand out from the sea of crappy DMs that don\u2019t provide a shred of value before asking for something in return?\n7 Steps To Non-Needy Networking\nThis process started as a viral Twitter thread, turned into a module in the Digital Economics cohort, then was used to help people get eyes on their writing in my writing course (2 Hour Writer).\nThis is foundational, and we will be using this to guarantee growth in the upcoming Solopreneur Sprint.\nKnowing how to communicate and DM another person that you want to connect with will open up opportunities to paid work, social leverage, and meeting high-level people. You can use this strategy to:\nGet a 50,000+ follower account to retweet your thread which will result in massive growth (the same goes for any other social platform sharing your post).\nHave connections that will share new growth strategies with you (Dickie Bush just sent me a LinkedIn tip the other day out of nowhere, I feel compelled to return the favor now).\nJoin or create mastermind groups and begin forming your tribe (that you will grow with for much of your social media journey).\nTo put your name in more people\u2019s mouths. The more people that know about you, the more work and potential connections will be sent your way. Get your name in front of as many eyes as possible.\nHere are the 7 steps of Non-Needy Networking:\n1) Find somebody that you WANT to DM\nThis is not exclusive to making connections. It is crucial for paid work as well.\nThe common theme among service businesses (like freelancers and agencies) is that their life is a living hell if they do not resonate with the client they are working with.\nReach out to people that:\nYou are inspired by\nYou would want to work with\nYou would want to strategize with\nYou see potential for mutual benefit\nWhen you are just starting out, you will have to work your way up the ladder. Start by DMing people that are within your follower range.\nIf you don\u2019t know who to DM, I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t started yet. A consumer perceives social media content from an entirely different lens than a creator.\nOnce you have an audience and leverage, you can really reach out to anybody and get a warm response.\nWhere can you find people to DM?\nThe \u201cfollowing\u201d list of accounts that you like.\nOr, in the reply area of one of your mentors (if people are replying, it is implied that they are trying to grow and network).\nThose are the main two areas to find people without using any fancy prospecting tools.\n2) Send them an inspired compliment\nFind a piece of their content, work, or current projects that you are truly inspired by. Send it to them and tell them how it resonated with you.\nThis requires you to actually like their work.\nPeople love praise \u2014 and per the principle of reciprocity \u2014 will feel obligated to repay this soft favor.\nAn example for a tweet on managing emotions:\nWhat\u2019s up Dan, this tweet hit me hard. I\u2019ve been going through it the past couple of days and this instantly gave me some relief. Thank you. [add the link to the post you liked]\nSimple as that.\n3) Show interest in them\nIf they don\u2019t respond, you can try reaching out again in the same manner.\nShowing interest is communication 101 \u2014 showing interest makes you interesting.\nAsk them about:\nTheir goals\nWhat they are building\nWhat they do for work\nThis gives you the opportunity to give value (even if YOU don\u2019t have value to give right now).\nLet\u2019s assume they respond with the generic \u201cthank you so much.\u201d\nNow, you can either find what they are working on from their profile or just ask them.\nIf you find what they are working on:\nWhat are your next plans with Modern Mastery? It\u2019s been crazy seeing it grow, I\u2019m curious what you\u2019ve got in store.\nIf you can\u2019t find what they are working on:\nDo you have anything that you\u2019re building right now? With that kind of content you must have something bigger in the works.\n4) Lead with value\nThis is the part that trips most people up.\nYour first options are to:\nSee where you can help\nSend actionable tips\nSend resources, systems, or videos you\u2019ve created or remember off the top of your head\nDon\u2019t go straight for a transaction when you haven\u2019t given anything first.\nIf you have to ask more questions in order to send better actionable tips or resources, do it.\nBy resources I mean YouTube videos, articles, or anything that may be able to help them \u2014 or would pique their interest.\nIf you have no value to give you can:\nSend a resource that can help them with their goals\nConnect them with someone else in your network\nJust continue having a good conversation and showing interest\nShow that you are interested in helping them.\n5) Get on a call to make a deeper connection\nThis part is optional but recommended. You can skip straight to step 7 after a few days, but I would practice all of these steps at some point.\nMaking that \u201cface-to-face\u201d interaction is priceless. Nobody can see you, your personality, or your mannerisms via text.\nWhen I was starting out, I was getting on zoom calls left and right with people that I wanted to get to know better. It\u2019s more normal than you think \u2014 and people are usually open to it when it is clear that you are just there to get to know them.\nYou can also take the conversation somewhere like Telegram and send voice messages to make yourself seem more human. Most social accounts use Telegram and Whatsapp groups to communicate and strategize.\n6) Follow up with value\nRemember their goals and keep an eye out for any content, resources, or people you can send their way. When you find something or someone, send it to them.\nI remember you telling me about your plans for [their project or goal]. I found this today and thought you\u2019d find it helpful.\n\u201cThis\u201d can be a YouTube video, article, lead magnet you found, or a person you connected with that may be able to help them.\n7) Follow up with an ask\nBy this point, you\u2019ve built a pretty damn solid connection. You\u2019ve given value to the point where they are ready to return the favor. From here you can:\nAsk them to join a mastermind group\nSend them one of your posts that you put a lot of time into\nAsk any specific questions you have for them without paying for consulting\nIf your plan is to leverage their audience for growth, be sure to write a post that they would want to share. Then, you can send it to them and mention that they inspired that post.\nYo, just wrote this up and thought you\u2019d enjoy it. It was inspired by our previous conversation.\nDo not ask them to share it. Let them engage with it however they see fit.\nEven if you don\u2019t get a retweet or share, any engagement will help more people see it \u2014 helping you grow. (This is not limited to Twitter. Everything we talk about can transfer over to any social media, they all have the same structure.)\nYou should be reaching out to people almost every day. If you are immersing yourself in the environment of your interests, you should see inspirational people that you want to reach out to on a daily basis.\nIf you want to increase the chances of larger accounts responding to your DMs \u2014 follow them and engage with their content for a few days before reaching out so they are familiar with your face and profile picture.\n8) Final tip\n\u201cDan, won\u2019t this take a lot of time?\u201d\nYes, obviously.\nIf it takes 4 years to get a job that has nothing to do with your degree and 10 more years to work up to a reasonable salary \u2013 it\u2019s gonna take time time to build your own dreams.\nWhich is ironic, because the \u201cuncertain\u201d path of doing your own thing is the quickest fix out there, people just lack perspective.\nIf you understand that DMs will be a part of your life when the time comes to take accountability for your future, then you should adopt the habit right now.\nSame with being a writer.\nWhy are you not writing every single day if you plan on doing it every single day in the future? Because you aren\u2019t getting paid? So you\u2019re putting of getting paid even more by not writing for free? Are you actually serious about any of this sh*t?\nGet your sh*t together.\nAs you can tell I\u2019m feeling feisty today.\nToo much coffee.\nI\u2019m out.\n\u2013 Dan\nWhat Happened This Week\nIf you want to create your niche of one, write 20+ foundational content pieces, and create a growth strategy for your brand \u2013 Solopreneur Sprints starts on February 7th (a little over a week).\nEnroll here for $150\nI know a lot of new faces are here from YouTube, and everyone\u2019s been asking about my strategies. We dropped two 30-minute YouTube trainings in Modern Mastery.\nReaders can join for $5\nIf you are an absolute beginner, with zero skills, I would recommend that you learn to write (because its the foundation of any other skill that you are trying to articulate to a potential customer). 2 Hour Writer gives you my system for learning writing in the real world, so you can build leverage at the same time.\nEnroll in 2 Hour Writer"

        "content": "People want to follow humans.\nThey don\u2019t want to follow a search engine with a face on it.\nAnd, with the rise of ChatGPT and future iterations of language AI, authenticity is more important than ever.\nEveryone is desperate for human connection, and social media is not delivering that.\nYou can, and it will lead to more authority than you could imagine.\nAuthenticity, from my predictions, will be the differentiating factor for the future generation of creators (which is why I talk about philosophy, self-awareness, and other non-business topics that actually make you stand out in business).\nI\u2019ve worked directly and indirectly with over 5,000 creators, and this is a problem they encounter time and time again.\nThis seems to be the most overwhelming problem.\nCreators don\u2019t know how to incorporate who they are into their content.\nThis makes people quit before it starts getting good.\nAnd, even if you stick it out, if you don\u2019t display who you are and where you came from, what separates you from a robot?\nEven worse, people that try to incorporate more than one interest don\u2019t know how to write in a way that leads to growth, authority, and engagement.\nBefore we dive into organizing your topics, writing content, and turning 1 idea into 10, here\u2019s a bit of credibility:\nI started as a creator 3 years ago.\nI launched a product right when I started, which most people warn against.\nI wrote about anything I wanted to, like emotional management and self-improvement, when my product was related to web design.\nI incorporated web design tweets here and there (maybe once every 2 days?) because I knew it was important.\nThe most important thing for those worried about monetization:\nTalk about whatever you want, and when you plan to promote, talk about that topic more.\nIt\u2019s that simple.\nWell, kinda.\nExperience will teach you more than I can here.\nBefore we dive in:\nThe first Solopreneur Sprint starts February 7th.\nIn 14 days, we will create confidence in your niche of one, create 20+ foundational content pieces, and create a zero-cost growth strategy for your creator brand.\n>> Check it out here if interested.\nYour Topic Tree\nIf you don\u2019t know what to write about, read the last letter about turning yourself into the niche.\nIn that letter, we outlined your life story and turned it into book chapters.\nWhat skills and interests are going to help you create your ideal future?\nAnd for those that are already on the path, what skills, interests, and expertise do you have that have helped you achieve your goals?\nUnderstand that non-money-making interests help you achieve your goals as well.\nIf your ideal future consists of being at peace and not worrying about money\u2026\nIt sounds like spirituality is the solution to all of those, not money. So, don\u2019t hesitate to include the things you love talking about.\nAn added benefit is your passion for that interest will display in your content.\nThese are what we are going to use for our content.\nChoose 2-3 Interests Or Skills You Want To Write About\nThese should already be at the top of your mind.\nI can\u2019t help you much here, as I am not you.\nIf you don\u2019t have interests you want to write about, you need to set a goal, start pursuing it, and learn what will help you get there.\nBroaden & Breakdown\nMost people start with hyper-specific interests like \u201cbiomechanical movement therapy\u201d and get stressed out because so few people are interested in it.\nEven further, they get stressed out again because they feel like if they don\u2019t talk about that specific thing, their entire monetization potential goes down the drain.\nNot how it works, my friend. Zoom out.\nLet\u2019s say my interests are:\nWeb design\nWeight lifting\nSpirituality\nFrom those, I want to broaden them into the overarching market they reside in.\nWeb design = online business or business in general.\nWeight lifting = bodybuilding or health in general.\nSpirituality = self-actualization or improvement.\nNow that we have 3 broad markets we can move within, we want to break them down into topics and sub-topics.\nThe beauty in this method:\nIf you want to make money with an interest like \u201cbiomechnical movement therapy,\u201d you can attract people interested in health.\nThen, you can slowly raise their awareness around bio movement and educate them on why its important.\nYou are not supposed to just attract people that know everything about your main interest. Why would they buy from you?\nWith those 3 interests, grab a notebook and break them down like so:\nYour job is to cover this entire domain in 6-12 months with all lengths of content.\nThat is how your brand perception is formed.\nRemember The 3 Pillars Of Social Leverage\nBefore we start creating content, we want to have a balance of the content style we write.\nThe 3 pillars of social leverage are growth, authenticity, and authority.\nYour content, on a 1-2 month timescale, should hit each of these.\nIf you aren\u2019t growing, pivot.\nIf you aren\u2019t making sales, pivot.\nIf you aren\u2019t gaining loyal fans, pivot.\nIterate as you get more real-world feedback. You have to post, even if it sucks.\nHow To Write 3 Authoritative Content Pieces\nWe are going to be writing tweets for this.\nWhy? Because tweets are the perfect length and structure for high-performing posts on any platform.\nMy LinkedIn posts, Instagram posts and reels, TikToks, and the rest are all based off of my tweets.\nWe are going to start by establishing authority in your main interest, the one that makes you money.\nWe will use \u201cmarketing\u201d as an example.\nWith any of the examples below, you can:\nTurn them into threads or newsletters for more authority\nRepurpose any point of the list into its own post\nCopy and paste them to other platforms\nUse them as scripts for Shorts, Reels, or TikToks\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nActionable Principles\nSimple, write a list that goes over actionable steps a beginner can take.\nThis helps you build authority in one interest. And, even advanced people will follow you, because they understand the importance of the fundamental principles.\nFor all of these, please keep in mind that you should follow a hook > body > conclusion structure.\nYour content sucks because you don\u2019t:\n\u2013 Hook in the reader\n\u2013 Agitate their problem\n\u2013 Relate to their problem\n\u2013 Give them a valuable solution\nHuman psychology will always beat what you think will work.\nClear, not clever.\nI\u2019m writing these on the spot, so these won\u2019t be perfect, but do this along with me.\nPick one of your main interests, craft a hook, give actionable value, and wrap it up nicely.\nPractice makes perfect.\nImportance Of A Topic\nMost people don\u2019t care about what you are writing about because they don\u2019t understand its importance.\nSo, instead of packing up your bags and blaming the system\u2026\nTeach them why it\u2019s important.\nThis is how you make your interests interesting to other people.\nMake them aware of how it can impact their life.\nMarketing is the greatest skill you can learn.\nWhy?\n\u2013 It pairs with any other skill\n\u2013 It teaches you human psychology\n\u2013 It helps you monetize a niche interest\nOnly a fool expects to make an income without learning the skill that turns scrollers into customers.\nHere\u2019s a great example I swiped from Taylin Simmonds on Twitter:\nTry it out.\nWhy is your main topic important?\nHow has it impacted your life?\nWhy should other people care?\nSelf-reflect and write a post on it.\nCalling Out Common Mistakes Or Problems\nA great way to establish authority in your topic is to call out bad advice, common mistakes, or problems.\nThis shows that you have experience and that you want to help your readers.\nStop writing hyper-specific content.\nAs a beginner, you should be focused on growth.\n\u2013 Make your writing relatable\n\u2013 Focus on a common problem\n\u2013 Talk about the topic from a high level\nDon\u2019t expect to grow if only a few people would share your content.\nThis leads into my next advice.\nHow To Get The Most Out Of Your Writing\nBeginner creators struggle with seeing the big picture of content creation.\nYou aren\u2019t aiming for an immediate sale with every post.\nYour posts are not sales pages (but knowing how to write sales pages can help with your posts).\nWhen you look at your writing, it should be obvious whether or not it would be shared by the average person scrolling on social media.\nIf it\u2019s not, and you don\u2019t have a growth strategy in your niche, how do you expect to grow?\nShares are the engine for organic brand growth.\nZoom out and realize that your content, over time, will introduce people to what you have to offer.\nWhen the time comes, and if you have the skill, they will buy from you.\nBroaden Your Content\nFrom the tweets I wrote above, are they authoritative?\nYes.\nWill they attract a potential customer (assuming I have more value they can find outside of my content)?\nYes.\nAre they so specific that they won\u2019t get shared?\nNo.\nThis is the balance you have to strike on top-of-funnel social media.\nThen, when you bring them to your newsletter, lead magnet, and product sales pages \u2013 that\u2019s where you get as specific as necessary.\nIf your content seems like it wouldn\u2019t be shared by a beginner, zoom out one layer and rewrite it.\nStudy The Best Content Structures\nBefore we start writing content other than lists, I would recommend you study what good content looks like.\nI personally use TweetHunter (a software) and Twemex (a chrome plugin) to quickly see my favorite accounts\u2019 top content.\nYou can also use Twitter\u2019s advanced search to do this by typing in:\nfrom:thedankoe min_faves:1000\nTo your Twitter search bar.\nJust replace my username with someone else\u2019s and change the minimum likes to anything you\u2019d like.\nImmerse yourself in that content and use it as training wheels for your own.\nWhat topics do you use to practice with this?\nRepurpose Your List Style Content\nThe lists you wrote above have multiple bullet points that can be turned into it\u2019s own content.\nThese lists can also be turned into the outline of a thread, carousel, or newsletter.\n(I would highly recommend doing this to establish authority even more).\nFor now, let\u2019s focus on writing another short post.\nFrom the first tweet we wrote above, the first bullet point is \u201chook in your reader.\u201d\nAnd if I take one of my high-performing tweet structures like this one with 9,000 likes:\nThen I can write a new tweet:\nThe greatest digital skill is the ability to capture, hold, and deliver value on attention.\nThat could be better, but I know that one will do well.\nYou can see how simple all of this content writing stuff is if you follow these exact steps with all of your interests.\nTo recap:\nYou can, and should, incorporate your interests to make your brand authentic\nCreate a topic tree that you can master in 6-12 months through writing\nWrite multiple list-style content pieces to establish authority in your main interest\nBroaden your writing if you don\u2019t think it will be shared\nStudy the best content structures, use them as training wheels, and branch off of what you\u2019ve already written\nThis is all you need to get started with content creation.\nIn the next letter, we will discuss how you can get that content shared without spending a penny.\nHope you enjoyed this one, my friends.\nTalk soon.\n\u2013 DK\nHow I Can Help You

        "content": "The first business course I bought was a 6 figure agency course.\nThis was 6 years ago.\nBefore that, I didn\u2019t see the value in courses.\nI tried doing everything myself.\nI knew the information was online, and it was, but it never worked.\nThere were too many missing pieces.\nFree education on social media is great, but the algorithm encourages people to keep it short, sweet, and focused on the most interesting topics.\nEveryone wants free free free and that\u2019s what causes the problem of high value advice getting buried under a sea of noise.\nDon\u2019t act like you are immune to this. Nobody is.\nWhen I was fed up with my multiple business attempts, I was ready to invest my entire bank account.\nI researched the best business models, found a dude who had a good reputation, watched his webinar, and paid $999.\nThis was a huge chunk out of my finances.\nIt all went onto my first credit card.\nAnd, as a college student working part-time, it put a lot of stress on me.\nI was juggling so many things at once.\nSchooling that I didn\u2019t care about\u2026 but it pushed back my deadline to make my business work before getting a job.\nA part-time job that was clearly a dead end.\nMultiple business failures before this.\nThere was a lot on the line.\nAnd, to cut to the chase, it didn\u2019t work out.\nThe course was great, and taught me about the applicability of copywriting, funnels, sales, and the client acquisition process that went on to fuel my future businesses\u2026\nBut, there were three things that destroyed my chances at success:\nI didn\u2019t give a flying f*ck about running a Facebook ads agency. I didn\u2019t want to work on my business.\nCold emailing local businesses was time-consuming, stressful, and none of them had the money to pay me.\nI was never confident in my niche, and that led to an immense amount of friction and shiny object syndrome.\nThis Facebook ads journey of mine taught me more than any other business, course, or opinion out there.\nAnd, even if it didn\u2019t teach me a direct lesson, it identified a problem in all future businesses I would start.\nChoosing a niche.\nBefore we dive in, this is a planned post (but I still plan to give as much value as possible here).\nThe first Solopreneur Sprint starts February 7th. The first thing we go over is exactly how to create a niche you are confident in, one that resembles you. Consider checking it out.\nIt\u2019s a $150 cohort with an interesting, but impactful, structure (so I don\u2019t have to charge thousands for the same material).\nThe Most Profitable Niche Is You\nThe ad agency wasn\u2019t my first, or last, business attempt.\nOther people had made the freelancing model work, and I wasn\u2019t giving up just yet (even though I \u201cgave up\u201d multiple times before).\nAfter grinding my way to my first 6 figures, I stumbled across Twitter.\nI found accounts in a little community called \u201cMoney Twitter\u201d and they introduced me to a path that would lead to where I am now.\nIt didn\u2019t all happen at once, but I had a vision for the future of my brand.\nI wrote content, built a product, and focused on solving the problems that stood in the way of my ideal future.\nBut, one thing made me stand out from everyone else in the business scene:\nI didn\u2019t have a static niche.\nMy newly repositioned offer was marketing consulting for creators (it only made sense to get out of the local business niche), but I didn\u2019t only talk about marketing.\nI talked about whatever I wanted, in a way that illustrated the topic\u2019s importance to a broad audience.\nIf I wanted to talk about emotional management, I would.\nIf I wanted to talk about fitness and nutrition, I would.\nIf I wanted to post an aspirational piece of advice, I would.\n80% of my content did not revolve around my service, and it didn\u2019t matter.\nWhy would it?\nIf I can be interested in both business and fitness, other people can too.\nAnd, if you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to narrow down your niche, is this not the best way to do it?\nJust target the people that are like you, or want to become like you since they have a similar ideal future.\nIt\u2019s not like you promote your products or services in all of your content.\nAnd, you can create a system that bakes authoritative and promotional content in.\nIf I want to launch a new product or service, here is what I would do:\nTalk about whatever I want, in an interesting way that leads to growth.\nCraft a 3-week long strategy based on the topics in the product or service (this builds authority, and, it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now with Solopreneur Sprints\u2026 pay attention \u2013 did I talk about business in the last letter?).\nStart beginner level for the sake of customer awareness and increase to advanced as it gets closer to launch.\nWrite long, medium, and short-form content from the top down. The promotions write themselves.\nSystemize what worked and incorporate promotions throughout the week to keep sales high. Like bi-weekly threads on a topic around your offer.\nThere is a naunced separation between your brand and your product. Your brand is not your product.\nA few \u201coff-topic\u201d pieces of content aren\u2019t going to ruin your income. They actually help it if you know what you are doing.\nI was fortunate to have my money problems solved by the time I started as a creator.\nMost people start for the sake of money, which is good, but the need for survival can screw with your creative thinking.\nMost creators start by subscribing to one business ideology telling them to niche down as far as possible, target a person they have nothing in common with, and use a skill that they don\u2019t care about to get results. It\u2019s no wonder people quit so soon.\nIf you want to remove all competition, you have to think bigger.\nA personal brand can be a means to landing clients.\nBut, when you treat your message as your life\u2019s work, it is impossible to encapsulate everything in one traditional niche.\nYour big goals in life will take multiple skills, interests, and expertise. Like how spirituality can help with financial freedom or emotional management in business. Your interests are what make your brand unique.\nHow To Create Your Niche Of One\nFrom a spiritual lens, your \u201cbrand\u201d or \u201cself\u201d can be the outcome of repetitive business ideology or a conscious personal creation.\nIf your brand remains static, you\u2019re in for a world of pain. Instead, we want to evolve, and never stop.\nBecause if you don\u2019t evolve, you get trapped in a lower stage of creator development.\nLet\u2019s walk through how to recreate yourself (for the sake of business).\n1) Map Your Ideal Future\nHow is your story going to end?\nWill it result in peace, health, and fulfilling work? Or do you have no idea?\nYour story is what sets your personal brand apart.\nIf you don\u2019t have a vision for your future, how are you going to self-educate and execute in a conducive direction?\nSit with this and think.\nWe will come back to it in step 3.\n2) Intelligent Imitation\nWhen you take stuff from one writer it\u2019s plagiarism, but when you take from many writers it\u2019s called research. \u2013 Wilson Mizner\nMy voice is a combination of the voices I love.\nMy brand design is a combination of the colors, feel, and style I\u2019ve grown to like over time.\nMy products, website, and landing pages were made by taking the best from everyone else.\nA color here, button there, tone shift there, and other minor distinctions.\nI\u2019m not talking about a few big things that make you look like a copy cat. I\u2019m talking about every single minor distinction. This compounds with time.\nYou do things \u201cyour own way\u201d by taking the best from the people you aspire to be like and making it your own.\nThis works for any project, but here\u2019s what you do:\nWrite down the books that impacted you the most\nWrite down the creators, authors, or public figures who\u2019s style you love the most\nImmerse yourself in their work to condition your mind to think in that style\nWrite down their tone, voice, and what makes them great\nResearch their products, landing pages, and every detail about how they make an income\nIn short, create a tribe of mentors and exclusively consume their content for an extended period of time.\nBecome their best friends (in spirit).\nThen, transfer your passion for what you do through spirit.\nYou won\u2019t have to copy them if your subconscious mind pieces together their ideas into an original one.\nYou are a perspective vessel, and that is what makes you unique.\nIf you make it a habit to study every aspect of those you aspire to be like, good ideas will become automatic.\nThen, execute on those ideas from your perspective.\nPerspectives are goal oriented.\nSo, create from the perspective of trying to actualize your ideal future.\nSome people write in their journal because their goal is mental clarity.\nSome people write online because their goal is financial freedom.\nWhat is your goal? And how do particular skills and interests help you get there?\n3) Book To Brand Content\nEvery story has an ideal outcome, an end goal.\nThe path to this end goal is going to be filled with highs, lows, emotions, battles, mistakes, and solutions to be systemized.\nHere\u2019s how you turn your \u201cself,\u201d or brand into a niche that houses your content, products, and services:\nTreat your ideal future as the end goal of the story.\nMake note of your past, there are a select few pivotal moments that can be your starting point of the book.\nWrite down an outline of the book. What are the chapters that must be included to reach the end goal?\nOutline key points for each of those chapters.\nThis won\u2019t be immediate, but you need an outline.\nIdeas for chapters will come to you as you experience life and make progress.\nYou won\u2019t know what to write for some chapters, and that\u2019s the point.\nYou will have to acquire skills, interests, and expertise to actualize your reality.\nYou are the leader that attracts followers.\nPursue your goals, solve the problems standing in the way, and pass down your lessons.\n4) Write Your Story\nThe story makes the brand, and yours is unique.\nYour story makes you relatable to those going through the same low points as you.\nIt gives people hope that there is a way out, and that you are the lighthouse to guide them.\nNow that you have an outline for the story of your life, start writing it.\nWrite the sections of each chapter as an article or newsletter.\nRepurpose that writing into a podcast or YouTube video.\nCondense the main points into a thread, carousel or LinkedIn post.\nRewrite those main points as engaging tweets.\nTurn those tweets into reels and posts for other platforms.\nThis process gives you a multi-dimensional understanding of the topic you are speaking about.\nAnd, if you remember the best ways to learn, teaching is one of them.\nYou will hate your first pieces of content, but that is how you identify a problem to solve.\nIf you struggle to write, that is a good thing.\n5) When In Doubt, Zoom Out\nThe solution to struggle is perspective.\nThis journey is difficult.\nYou will struggle to articulate your niche, because nobody wants to put themselves in a box.\nUnderstand that you don\u2019t need to solve this problem immediately.\nInstead, you need to set an intention to solve the problem.\nFrom there, you educate yourself with courses, content, and conversations that will store creative firepower in your brain.\nOverload your mind with potential solutions.\nJust don\u2019t get distracted.\nNext, zoom out.\nGive your mind some breathing room to craft a creative solution to that problem.\nGo on a walk. Go out with friends. Hit the gym.\nDo anything that allows you to stop thinking about work.\nLike magic, the \u201caha!\u201d moment will come.\nYour subconscious mind will send the breakthrough idea to your conscious mind.\nThis cyclical process is called sovereign living.\nThe highs and lows of life are not masked over by the routine of a job.\nKeep that in mind, and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nP.S. The first Solopreneur Sprint starts on February 7th.\nThis is an intensive 14-day strategy for overwhelmed creators:\nBuild the base of your one person business\nCreate and gain confidence in your niche of one\nWrite 20+ foundational content pieces (that you can repurpose 1000 different ways)\nLearn zero-cost strategies to getting eyes on your content and profile (for followers)\nRepurpose your best content and leverage them to grow even faster\nWithout the high prices of the normal cohort model.\nIf you\u2019re interested, enroll here.\nThe price is $150 (for a brand that you will leverage for life)."

        "content": "The Middle Ages, also known as the \u201cDark Ages,\u201d was an era filled with war, ignorance, famine, and pandemics.\nWhat came after set the scene for modern civilization \u2013 The Renaissance Era. A cultural, political, and economic rebirth that housed many of the thinkers, artists, and scientists we know today.\nHistory repeats itself, and the Digital Dark Ages are among us.\nBut, there is a light on the horizon.\nThe Digital Dark Ages are a time of distraction, closed-mindedness, and cheap dopamine.\nWe\u2019ve lost touch with the belief systems that gave an individual a sense of certainty for their future.\nAnd, if we don\u2019t take it upon ourselves to create our own sense of purpose, we distract ourselves to maintain the little sanity we have left.\nHaving a vision \u2013 that you create \u2013 gives you a sense of control over your life. A purpose that fuels your present actions.\nThat vision presents a hierarchy of goals that increase in challenge as you acquire the skills necessary to achieve those goals.\nThis is how you create an endless source of good dopamine.\nA vision that is a conscious personal creation forces you to focus your mind.\nA focused mind is the source of life enjoyment.\nWithout a vision, you inevitably become a slave to the system.\nYou will shy from thinking about your future because it seems painful, hopeless, and uncertain.\nBecause of this, you will find solace in a few things:\n1) The societal machine\nThe clear path of going to school, getting a job, and retiring happily is enticing. So, you relinquish your freedom to choose and do what you\u2019re told.\n2) Momentary pleasures\nDeep down, we know we aren\u2019t making the right choice.\nThat is painful.\nSo we numb our minds with endless scrolling, sitcom binges, and foods that taste good for a few seconds but lowers our ability to function at our peak capacity \u2013 because why would you need to if your future is already decided?\n3) Modern distractions\nDistractions are not just digital.\nThey are everything that doesn\u2019t align with your vision.\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a vision, how are you going to filter what is important from what is meaningless?\nThe catalyst for these distractions is you. Your identity.\nYou were told what to learn, think, and do.\nYou didn\u2019t question it, but accepted it as fact.\nSo, your mind is narrowed on everything that reinforces that identity and feels threatened by anything that does not.\nAll 3 of these can be grouped into one thing, the greatest trap of the 21st century:\nClosed-mindedness.\nSigns Of The Closed Minded\nClosed-mindedness is the inability to see beyond your narrow perspective in any situation.\nIf your perspective only shines a negative light on that situation, even worse.\nLet\u2019s take social media comment sections as an example.\nHow common is it for someone to completely miss the point of what\u2019s being said, interpret it for their benefit, and leave a comment that resembles nothing of the original message?\nLike when you read a polarizing political post, feel offended, and conveniently leave out their perspective because it doesn\u2019t align with yours.\nLittle do you realize that your perspective is not absolute truth, nor is theirs. And, if you seek to understand both, you inch your way toward a life of peace and creative problem-solving.\nPeople don\u2019t realize the depth behind these simple, unconscious actions. You are destroying your life. How? Because you aren\u2019t creating it. Without intentional action, the only way is down.\nNot only is this closed-minded, but it\u2019s also distracted.\nPeople can\u2019t focus their mind on a holistic outcome, and instead, cherry-pick what they see, start arguments, and get absolutely nowhere.\nThis is another embodiment of the quick-fix mindset.\nYou \u201cwin the game\u201d in your own mind, reap the cheap dopamine of doing so, and reinforce that bad habit\u2026 making it harder to break the more you do it.\nThe universe is an infinite song. Uni-verse. One song.\nSongs are symbolic of stories. Stories form the structure of games.\nAll understanding is metaphorical, and the mind makes sense of the world by stringing symbols into stories.\nThe inevitable highs, lows, pushes, pulls, yins, and yangs that construct your understanding of life.\nMost of it can\u2019t be put into words.\nLanguage is useful, but extremely limiting.\nThis is why the structure of games order our mind and allow us to tap into the flow state.\nIn essence, closed-mindedness is assuming what you think the story is, rather than what it actually is.\nIf you assume that someone else\u2019s words can plug into the story running in your head, you\u2019re in for a bad time.\nSo, let\u2019s start expanding your mind.\nNone of this happens overnight.\nThis is a process of making the unconscious, conscious, and correcting your behavior over weeks, months, and years.\nLet\u2019s go over a few common traits that would indicate closed-mindedness.\nI\u2019ll leave it up to you to become aware of this in your everyday life.\nAs you become aware, I encourage you to slowly correct your actions with the strategies we talk about in the next section.\nAwareness begets improvement. Improvement begets awareness.\n1) Assumption and Expectation\nMost people are walking distractions.\nThey are the distraction. Their identity distracts them from truth.\nYour reality is determined by your conditioning.\nThat is, your identity that houses your perspective. Your perspective houses your beliefs, thoughts, and experiences that you hold as truth. For most people, this perspective, or worldview, is shared with your parents, culture, and society.\nThese are limits on what you think is possible.\nIf all you know is school, work, and retirement, your behavior will follow.\nYour programming is a network of hardwired assumptions and expectations of the world.\nUnless you can expand your mind beyond them, you are doomed to a life of the limits that others imposed on you.\nScratch that\u2026 the limits that you imposed on yourself.\n2) Selfish Perspective\nOutside of the present moment, everyone is acting in alignment with a specific goal.\nThis goal can be conscious, subconscious, or unconscious.\nMost people are unconscious, they act in a way that favors their survival. And, if humans survive on a conceptual level, they act in a way that reinforces their hard-set beliefs, assumptions, and expectations. They act in a way that confirms their self-image.\nHow do you spot this in the real world?\nIt\u2019s not hard.\nLook at any political post.\nHow many people are in the comments arguing about how the other side is wrong? How many are willing to die over their beliefs?\nRepublicans will defend their political stance as the best because they are republicans.\nEvery freelancer will defend their business model as the best because they are a freelancer.\nEvery Christian, Muslim, and atheist will defend their belief system as the best because they are that belief system.\nWhat people fail to see is that these people are human too.\nThey went through a different cultural, social, or even business conditioning process that hardwired beliefs in their head.\nIn their mental, physical, financial, and spiritual environment, those beliefs serve their identity the best.\nIf you want a more holistic version of truth, you must be able to transfer your consciousness into their mind. You have to prove yourself wrong.\nEverything is relative, and you have to understand that in some countries, your beliefs would have you physically killed.\nThey don\u2019t care how \u201cright\u201d you think you are.\nAnd from the perspective of the universe, everyone is right, and everyone is wrong.\n3) Literal Interpretation\nWhen I say \u201cdisappear for 6 months to work on yourself,\u201d how do you perceive that statement?\nDo you think I\u2019m actually telling you to disappear?\nOr do you think I\u2019m using a metaphor for higher-impact writing?\nWhether you are a Christian or not, when you read the bible, do you think that Noah took 2 of every kind of animal on a giant ark in flood?\nMaybe he did, maybe he didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s the point.\nFocus.\nUnderstand the essence, lesson, or truth that the words are pointing at.\nAnd please, for the love of all things holy, don\u2019t message me about typos in my writing.\nSame story.\nFocus.\n4) Missing The Point\nThis is similar to literal interpretation of words.\nInternet trolls are notorious for intentionally missing the point of any given post.\nThey laser in on the one thing that has nothing to do with the message as a whole.\nYou wouldn\u2019t take one lyric from a song, play it on its own, and expect it to make sense.\nThe uni-verse (one song) is the same.\nDon\u2019t miss the point of life, or any of its multi-dimensional aspects, by lasering in on one part of the story.\nThe low point in your life is a part of the bigger picture.\nIf you can\u2019t see it, your mind lacks order, and will consume you.\n5) Vision Avoidance\nWe discuss having a vision for your life in almost every letter.\nThis is intentional.\nYour vision isn\u2019t clear in an instant. You need a constant reminder. That way, you can reflect on recent experiences to start moving in a better life direction.\nThe thing is, some people avoid this thought entirely.\nEvery single person knows that deep down they are capable of more.\nBut, the path to actualizing that potential isn\u2019t clear, and the opposite of clarity is confusion.\nTo mask that confusion, they distract themselves with momentary pleasures.\nThe instant gratification feels good now, but hurts later.\nActing in alignment with your purpose hurts now, but feels good later.\nFlip the switch.\nOpen Your Mind \u2013 The Art Of Zooming Out\nEmpty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. \u2013 Bruce Lee\nEveryone knows that quote, but how many have sat with it, questioned it, and let it fill their mind with insight?\nMost people read it, think that they \u201cwin\u201d the cliche understanding game for a quick dopamine hit, and close their mind to the depth beyond the sentence.\nPeak experiences seem to be the result of one of two types of focus:\nHyper-focus on what\u2019s in front of you, doing.\nRadical open focus that grasps at nothing, being.\nAll something or all nothing.\nUnderstand that these are peak states of consciousness. They are difficult, if not impossible, to sustain if you have worldly responsibilities.\nClosed-mindedness in this sense can be useful when your attention is engaged on a hierarchy of goals in alignment with your vision for the future. You are \u201cat one\u201d with a task. Your mind is empty of thought because there is nothing to think about. You just do.\nSo, open-mindedness, in the most extreme sense, is opening your mind beyond all form, limitation, and distraction. At one with the universe as opposed to the task.\nIn this state, you don\u2019t hold onto thoughts. You are the silent observer underneath the layered ego.\nOpen-mindedness comes in stages.\nAn example (in no specific order):\nStage 1) You believe religion is the only path to salvation.\nStage 2) You believe religion is mind control.\nStage 3) You believe religion has deep truths when interpreted from a metaphorical lens.\nIn business, this is similar:\nStage 1) You believe freelancing is the best business model.\nStage 2) You believe most business models are scams.\nStage 3) You believe that all business models hold truths that can be used to improve the one that aligns with your interests.\nOh, and would you look at that, a course that gives my perspective on how to do just that.\nWe all know a few people that have adopted, and identified, with each of those perspectives.\nSome are more open-minded than others.\nAnd, the ones that are, lead to less suffering and more success.\nThe benefits of open-mindedness are obvious:\nDeeper intelligence, heightened creativity, less reactivity, fulfilling relationships, novel content ideas, and other things like artful navigation of what would be polarizing domains like politics.\nSo, let\u2019s dive into some practical steps to open your mind.\nAnd, as always, please internalize that this is not instant. Quick fixes in your thinking are against the point here.\nThis is a lifelong practice.\nMeaning, it has to become a part of your identity if you want the outcomes of open-mindedness.\nIf you can\u2019t do it every day, why are you doing it?\n1) Critical Thinking 101\nHold all thoughts, ideas, and opinions in the realm of possibility until filtered through direct experience.\nYou do not have to prove something right or wrong in an instant.\nYou are allowed to let things marinate in your mind without identifying with any side of an argument.\n2) Work Towards A More Holistic Identity\nYour identity houses your perspective.\nYour perspective houses your beliefs.\nYour beliefs influence your thoughts, emotions, and actions.\nSo, if we adopt an identity that is greater than us, our mind opens as such.\nThis is how you develop your ego.\nIf the ego works to survive what we identify with, and we identify with say humanity, then we will act to preserve humanity.\nI am not 100% certain about this, but I believe this is what some people mean when they identify themselves as God. We aren\u2019t talking about the Christian notion of God here. We are talking about what Brahman, the Absolute, Source, Infinity, Mind (not brain), or the Universe.\nThink of it like this.\nIf you are on a sports team, the \u201cSnowbirds,\u201d then you will identify as a Snowbird. The spirit of that team forms a collective ego that fuels your games. That spirit is also transferred to fans that identify with that team.\nThe same is true for identifying with a corporate job, religion, or family.\nBe careful, be conscious, and fix problems as they come up in how your identity impacts the world. Certain identifications will either close or open your mind.\nPlease note: we are identifying in mind or spirit, not physicality or intellect.\nIf you want to identify as something hyper-limiting, like a toaster oven or an apache attack helicopter, be my guest. Or, go back to the previous section on \u201cintentionally missing the point.\u201d Unless the point is humor, of course, that\u2019s useful.\nIf you are the Universe, which you are, then your petty human problems lose their weight. And, you can see political, cultural, and even global creation and destruction from a better vantage point.\nWhat is the point of identifying as the Universe?\nNot for nobility, status, or any other selfish endeavor that pops into your mind, clearly, but by improving your decision-making in a way that benefits more than yourself.\nThat is, seeing beyond your survival. Thinking twice about going from one surface-level pleasurable distraction to another.\nHow is your life\u2019s work going to impregnate the minds of the world?\nIf you love beer, can you open a brewery and transfer that passion into your customers?\nIf you love philosophy, can you start writing online and transfer your understanding to others?\nFrom a universal perspective, this is reproduction, or creation. You transfer obsession through spirit, because humans have transcended (and included) the physical.\nThe physical is important of course, but it is only a fraction of the total importance in our lives.\nThis all sounds great, but how do we develop ourselves to embody this?\n3) Collecting Consciousness\nThis takes decades, and I can only speak from experience here.\nI am not an almighty guru here to tell you exactly what to do.\nThis is my level of understanding and what I am working towards.\nTo collect consciousness, you need to understand the multiple perspectives that form a superior identity.\nYou need to transfer consciousness and seek to understand, not judge.\nLike how a predator can transfer consciousness into their prey and predict their next moves. And if they make a mistake? Even better, that\u2019s how you understand with time.\nIf animals can do this, you can. Marketers, writers, and creators have to do it all the time.\nTransfer your consciousness into your reader, are they going to like, engage, and share your content? Or do you need to rewrite it?\nI teach this from a more practical lens in 2 Hour Writer.\nTransfer your consciousness into the driver that cut you off, are they in a rush? What if their mother is in the hospital? Or should they only care about your selfish need for a comfortable drive?\nFocus on the big picture here, not the minor details. There is of course no way you can know every single person\u2019s thoughts about a situation.\nBut, you can understand their actions, note patterns, and observe outcomes. We want to understand the experience, whether it can be put in words or not.\nOf course, you can\u2019t speak someone\u2019s language by seeking to understand their perspective. We are seeking the essence here beyond mere human existence. Like how \u201cstrength\u201d reflects in culture, society, animals, science, and the universe.\nWhen you study a bodybuilder as an identity, their perspective on food is different than the average person\u2019s.\nThey don\u2019t have to think about deciding against junk food. They just do it because it results in an optimal outcome for their goals.\nA successful businessman doesn\u2019t have to think about being consistent in business. It\u2019s just what they do.\nThe Universe doesn\u2019t have to think about a star or planet exploding, because in the grand scheme, something else comes into being.\nThis is something I want you to contemplate for yourself.\nStart by identifying as the highest version of yourself. This should align with your vision.\nStudy the people that have done what you want to do.\n4) Pause & Question\nA challenge:\nStudy the exact opposite of your beliefs in any domain.\nIf you are a vegan, study carnivores.\nIf you are a freelancer, study creators.\nIf you are a Christian, study atheists.\nApproach the situation by trying to prove yourself wrong.\nThe few people that can do this will launch their progress through the roof.\nThis is difficult, and you will experience an ego reaction.\nYour mind will have an imaginary battle with the beliefs you exposed yourself to.\nYou will feel threatened. Fight or flight from a belief. Humans are interesting. That is your concept of self working to survive.\nWhen you are aware of this reaction, question it.\nQuestioning is how you learn.\nPick something you disagree with in business, religion, or even health, and work through the following questions.\nWhen more questions come up, keep questioning.\nIs there something I can learn in this situation?\nWhat goal are they working to achieve?\nDoes that align with my goals? And does it matter if not?\nWhat is the context they are saying this from?\nWhat is the essence or lesson of what they are saying?\nCan I incorporate an aspect of their beliefs into my own?\nWith time, these should birth some incredible insights.\n5) Think Macro, Act Micro\nYou are a perspective vessel.\nYour actions, whether you are conscious of them or not, have an impact on the world. And on the timescale of your physical life, that can add up quite a bit.\nAs you open your mind to hold a more holistic perspective, your actions must follow suit.\nThink big picture, forget the petty details, and act.\nThe only way to acquire true knowledge is through mistakes.\nKnowledge is infinite, and in the relative world, nobody will be absolutely correct, only relative.\nYour job is to make mistakes, correct them, and allow humanity to improve over eons, not just your microscopic lifetime.\nThink bigger.\nPlease don\u2019t end your journey with this letter.\nIf you want to open your mind, you are going to have to change your mental habits.\nYou have to set an intention to seek truth \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t benefit you \u2013 and adopt open-mindedness as a constant practice in your life.\nThe highest version of every single one of you is open-minded.\nTry to expand your mind to embody that identity.\nLet your actions slowly reflect that.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nThe first Digital Economics Sprint starts mid-February.

        "content": "Early last year, I came across an American philosopher that was touted to be \u201cthe most conscious man alive.\u201d\nHis name is Ken Wilber.\nI bought a few of his books, like \u201cA Brief History Of Everything,\u201d and was instantly hooked.\nHis teachings on holism, consciousness, and integration helped me understand the world from a high level. A cosmic lens. Wilber answered my burning questions that other philosophers couldn\u2019t.\nAs I researched, I found one interesting thing:\nDavid Deida and Mark Manson (the authors of The Way Of The Superior Man and The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck) were former students of his.\nDeida went on to use the integral model to help explain sexuality and masculinity in his books.\nMy writing had a significant uptick after reading Ken\u2019s work as well. This philosophy stuff is a lot more practical when you are building your own thing (as you\u2019ll find out).\nBut Mark Manson\u2026 he had an interesting encounter.\nManson saw the rise and fall of Ken Wilber. He was an adamant student. He loved Wilber\u2019s insights.\nBut one day, out of nowhere, Ken \u201cturned\u201d on his audience and disappeared.\nMark\u2019s summary of Wilber\u2019s momentary downfall was this:\nNo matter how conscious the human being, they are still human.\nKen is now back in action after some time off and is making appearances on some more niche podcasts.\nWhile Ken did disappear out of nowhere and made some questionable remarks, there is still a lot we can learn from him. Especially when we don\u2019t jump to conclusions. His disappearance is rather refreshing, as the modern spirituality industry is just as bad as the modern fitness industry.\nHidden flaws that don\u2019t give the full picture.\nSimilar to how Alan Watts is a library of anxiety-soothing knowledge, he was a victim of alcoholism. Which does not contradict his philosophy. In fact, it shines light on the deceptive nature of the spirituality industry.\nWatts is one of the few that was true to himself.\nI recommend reading Ken\u2019s work to get the full picture, but I want to introduce you to what he calls a \u201cholon.\u201d\nA holon is the unit of everything.\nA holon is both a part and a whole.\nLike how an atom is a whole in itself, but also a part of a molecule, and so on up until you reach the whole of the cosmos.\nHolons span in infinite directions, like how wood is a part of a chair, but also a part of a tree, house, and table.\nHolons are the building blocks of creative problem-solving.\nAlan Watts has called these \u201cunits of thought.\u201d\nLeo Gura has called these \u201cfigments of consciousness.\u201d\nA snapshot of infinity. A limit that our mind creates. One of the infinite distinctions that enable our mind to assign meaning to the world around us.\nThe hidden material that joins holons together is relationship.\nAs Watts said, \u201cexistence is relationship, and you are smack in the middle of it.\u201d\nThey are not just physical, they are everything.\nThis is a powerful realization.\nThoughts, ideas, and emotions are holons.\nStruggle is a whole in itself, but also a part of fulfillment.\nHolons are best understood through philosophical contemplation. Pick something random, like an object in front of you, and follow it down a rabbit hole of discovery through questioning.\nSeriously, pick an object and ask a series of what, how, why, where, and when questions.\nDo not limit yourself to the physical world here, or even direct connections.\nIf I were to choose \u201choney\u201d as my holon to dissect, my mind can follow it to:\nThe process of making honey\nThe bees associated with pollination\nThe beekeepers and if they are making a living wage\nWhether any harm is being done to the bees\nThe manufacturing and distribution process of honey\nHow the honey impacts human health when consumed\nAnd onward to infinity\nEven the words in that sentence are parts in the whole of the sentence. The sentence a part of the whole of this letter. The letter the part of the whole of my content. And so on.\nYou are a whole that includes your interests. Interests are parts in the whole of a niche. Niches are a part in the whole of a market. Markets are a part in the whole of social media.\nIf you struggle in any domain of life, it\u2019s because your perspective doesn\u2019t include the aspects that would make it whole. This is why multi-perspectival understanding via open-mindedness and questioning is important.\nModern Enslavement \u2013 Society As A Pyramid Scheme\nNotice how holons are hierarchical.\nThey transcend and include one another.\nLike how humans transcend and include \u2013 or integrate \u2013 animals. With that transcendence, spirit emerged. The connection of minds through the intangible.\nEverything is structured as a hierarchy, and there are two types.\nThe first are dominator hierarchies, which is what gives the word \u201chierarchy\u201d a bad reputation. These consist of a pyramid scheme-esque structure.\nThe second are natural hierarchies or \u201cactualization hierarchies,\u201d which is \u201can order of increasing wholeness, such as: particles to atoms to cells to organisms, or letters to words to sentences to paragraphs. The whole on one level becomes a part of the whole of the next.\u201d\nYou can see the wisdom in how humans replicate this structure in society. But from a big picture, society would fall under the definition of a dominator hierarchy.\nSocietal entities like public schools, government, corporate jobs, and even religious institutions are structured in this way.\nLess people with more power at the top.\nMore people with less power at the bottom.\nIn a true pyramid scheme, there are investors at the bottom that enable the unfair power distribution.\nYou \u201cclimb\u201d the ladder through hard work, but rarely will you reach the top. If there are 1000 people at the bottom and 10 at the top, there is only room for so many people to get to the top, obviously.\nBut, money isn\u2019t the biggest problem here.\nThe people at the bottom of societal pyramid schemes are not investing money, they\u2019re investing attention.\nSince humans survive on a conceptual level, and if someone enslaves your attention, you will identify with that hierarchy.\nLike how people identify with their job title. When people challenge it, they get offended, and willingly rivet their attention to stay enslaved.\nPower in our modern world comes from attention.\nThose that hold power at the top of any pyramid require more collective psychic energy to maintain their power.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, the human mind craves order.\nWhen we can focus all of our attention on the tasks we enjoy pursuing, life becomes enjoyable.\nAnd with increasing anxiety, uncertainty, and overwhelm due to the downfall of traditional values \u2013 people flock to the \u201csafe and secure\u201d path toward becoming a cog in the societal machine (or scheme, if you will).\nWe\u2019ve replaced religious values with capitalistic values to maintain our sanity, which I am indifferent about. I am not pushing ideology here, nor do I believe \u201creturning to tradition\u201d is the answer. We are supposed to transcend and include, or evolve, not regress.\nThis is the definition of modern enslavement.\nIt\u2019s not physical, it\u2019s mental.\nAnd, it\u2019s the default state of most people unless they are made aware of it, which is what I\u2019m trying to do here.\nPolitical campaigns, corporate work, and religious ideology are upheld with mass attention to survive the ideas that form a collective ego.\nSocial conditioning from the day you are born narrows your mind to see the world the same as everyone else.\nBy the time you exit the school system, you are just as mechanical as an animal. Acting out of survival. The difference is that you are trying to uphold what other people told you is important.\nIt becomes automatic to invest our attention in an extrinsic hierarchy of goals. A dominator hierarchy that forms a collective ego \u2013 through attachment of individual identity \u2013 that works to conceptually survive.\nThe collective societal vision for your future is to get good grades, maybe get a high paying job, watch TV to \u201cease your mind,\u201d and maybe retire happily at 65. Both with the unconscious seeking of status, survival, and approval.\nWith the habit of investing attention in external status games, this process goes on to encourage us to waste our money on fancy cars, mansions, and other material items without consulting our own values, wants, and needs \u2013 because our self is not a product of our own conscious creation.\nYou escape this enslavement by creating your own actualization hierarchy to invest your attention in. One that orders your mind so you can enjoy life, create a conscious identity, and impact the world through your passionate work. Reproduction through spirit.\nYou can opt for doing nothing, but you won\u2019t escape your need to survive. Doing nothing about your life is exactly how you become a modern slave.\nThe Focus Formula \u2013 How To Take Control Of Your Life\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want, you will be told what you want, and you will believe it.\nUnless you have dissolved your ego and plan to live as a monk in the eternal present moment, you need a purpose.\nIt is not feasible for someone with worldly responsibilities to \u201clive in the present\u201d for the entirety of their lives. The present is a tool. A gift. A haven that you can resort to when you don\u2019t need to take immediate action.\nAnything that is not the present moment is a mental construction for understanding reality.\nSince \u201csuccess\u201d is determined by a hierarchy of goals that orders your mind and directs behavior, you must create your own.\nLet\u2019s create the structure to focus our lives:\nPurpose \u2013 Your North Star\nAt the peak of your actualization hierarchy is your purpose.\nFor the sake of simplicity, your purpose will be synonymous with your vision, life\u2019s work, and any other big goal in your life.\nThis is crucial. It is the most important step in taking control of your life because it is the whole that contains all parts. Without it, everything else we will talk about will fall apart.\nBut, when it comes to purpose, there are a few traps to be aware of:\nYou don\u2019t have one purpose for your life.\nThey come in stages, from shallow to deep.\nLike how your purpose as a teen might be to get back at your ex by becoming obsessed with the gym.\nBut, you eventually transcend that purpose and adopt one around health, longevity, and enjoyment.\nThere are no wrong actions.\n(Don\u2019t object that statement. Question it. \u201cWrong\u201d is determined by your narrow worldview and lack of perspective.)\nFollow your desires, self-reflect, raise your consciousness and make better decisions next time.\nDon\u2019t let the picture of perfection (that even spiritual teachers lie about) make you think you can\u2019t take one \u201cwrong\u201d step.\nMy \u201cworst\u201d actions led to the best points in my life, but only because I was conscious of their ramifications and changed my behavior accordingly.\nIt won\u2019t be crystal clear the first time around.\nTreat this as a Minimum Viable Purpose that you will refine with experience (you need experience to make you aware of opportunities).\nIf you need help with this, try creating an anti-vision.\nObserve the masses, realize what kind of life you don\u2019t want to live, and move in the opposite direction.\nI talk about this more in this quick video.\nYour purpose will fade.\nLife unfolds in chapters, like a book. Each chapter has a purpose that the words lead to.\nYou will feel lost heading into new chapters of your life, this is normal.\nDid anyone say that you aren\u2019t supposed to feel lost? Or did you tell yourself that? \u201cLost\u201d is something that exists. It\u2019s silly to think that the infinite nature of life shouldn\u2019t apply to you.\nThis is where self-reflection becomes crucial.\nAs you go about life, you will miss almost everything unless you reflect on your actions. That is, what went right and what went wrong, from your perspective.\nWhen you understand both, they are hints at your next purpose.\nLike puzzle pieces. When they connect, you feel the pull to go all in. This will not happen if you are constantly distracting yourself.\nHow do we create a meaningful purpose?\nThrough questioning.\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t asked the right questions.\nQuality questions dictate your quality of life, because the quality of your understanding is dependent on the quality of answers you receive.\nYou will not receive the answers to these questions immediately.\nYou ask yourself a question > move forward in life > and reflect on your experience for answers.\nUse these questions as attention anchors. With these questions made known, your mind will gravitate toward noticing answers as time goes on:\nWhat do I really want out of life?\nWhat is important to me?\nWhat is the highest version of myself?\nWhat does my ideal day look like?\nWhat do I have to accomplish in order to get there?\nDoes that solve a problem in the world, and what product or service aligns with both?\nWhat is the next phase of my purpose?\nWrite. These. Down.\nProcess \u2013 The Pursuit Of Mastery\nWhat is the process that will allow you to achieve that goal?\nEvery goal that you have \u2013 by nature \u2013 is accompanied by a subsequent hierarchy of goals descending down to a small, behavior-related goal, like writing the first word of an article.\nYour process, system, or strategy for achieving your purpose is how you prevent your mind from declining into chaos.\nSystems, when understood, help maintain order in your mind. This alone will 10x the enjoyment in your life.\nThe problem is that people think they will be fine just by \u201cwinging it.\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t hold this hierarchy of goals at the top of your mind, you will give too much mental energy \u2013 transferred through attention \u2013 to things that distract you from your process.\nMake these goals conscious by writing down 10 year, 1 year, monthly, weekly, and daily goals.\nAgain, get as specific as you can.\nSince these are written down, you will refine them with experience. This alone is a process within itself that will order your mind.\nThe process of mastery comes in stages.\nBeginner, intermediate, and advanced relating to the skills you must acquire to actualize your vision.\nYou must understand which stage you are in, and what you need to do to advance to the next stage.\nEvery stage will have its own set of lever-moving actions to polish off your process.\nAs a business beginner, your levers may be learning the fundamentals of marketing and sales, writing content, and making online connections.\nAs an intermediate, your levers may be building out a product so that you can monetize your audience. You can start to ween off of learning via external sources.\nAs an expert, your levers may be doing what you enjoy, repurposing your best work, and diversifying your reach.\nAgain, write all of this down.\nYearly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals paired with the lever moving actions that will move you toward achievement.\nPriority \u2013 Making Better Decisions\nFirst, this encapsulates your lever moving actions that we just discussed.\nThese are best framed as performance goals (as opposed to vanity goals).\nInstead of aiming for an uncontrollable goal of \u201c50 followers a day,\u201d aim to write 3 posts that may lead to 50 followers a day.\nInstead of aiming for a \u201cwell written article,\u201d aim for writing 1000 words (that you can come back and edit).\nThe specificity helps reduce the friction around action, because you are in direct control of the outcome.\nYou, at this point in your life, are a manifestation of all of your past choices. These choices are not just physical\u2026 but mental, financial, and spiritual.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that your life, 10 years from now, will be a manifestation of your choices today, tomorrow, and the next.\nMaking better decisions is easier when you have a purpose and process to bounce your focus between, but it\u2019s not enough.\nHere\u2019s how you make better decisions:\nBring your purpose to the top of your mind.\nThis will help you filter signal from noise. If it isn\u2019t conducive to your vision, it isn\u2019t important (unless you\u2019ve been convinced it is important by someone else).\nAll of this takes time.\nYour signal (importance) to noise (distraction) ratio will improve as you do.\nGain multi-perspectival understanding.\nDon\u2019t lock your mind into one perspective. Try to see the situation from multiple angles.\nYour perspective is based on your identity.\nWith time, we want to work towards adopting a cosmic perspective. If you identify as the universe, human problems become minor, and you can begin working towards creative solutions to advance humanity.\nBut, that takes time.\nAs humans, we work to survive our identity. You can\u2019t escape survival, we still have an animalistic nature in us. But, we can work to survive a more \u201cenlightened\u201d identity, like the cosmos, humanity, or the actualized version of yourself.\nIf your perspective is a part of the whole that is your identity, you evolve by transcending and including different perspectives until you\u2019ve become the whole of the cosmos.\nStart by identifying with your future self, how would they approach situations?\nIf you can do this, decision making will become automatic, as you are trying to survive the idea of your higher self.\nPerspective goes so deep. I\u2019m planning another letter for it, but the main question is this:\nHow can you view the situation that allows you to perceive it in a way that is conducive to action?\nPerceive the situation in a way that allows you to act in alignment with your purpose.\nProblems are only problems if you interpret them as such.\nIf you don\u2019t feel like getting out of bed, step back and think about your measly problem.\nThere are people that don\u2019t have legs. They can\u2019t get out of bed without help.\nThere are people that don\u2019t have a bed or food to cook in the morning.\nAdopt their perspective and interpret your problem from their lens, do you think they give a f*ck if you don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like getting out of bed?\nYou have a purpose to actualize.\nMove.\nConsciousness\nState of consciousness is everything.\nThrough social conditioning \u2013 so we can operate within society \u2013 most people have a narrow worldview.\nThis worldview contains their beliefs which influence thoughts which influence emotions which influence attention.\nAttention influences behavior.\nIf you are only aware of the path that society has laid out for you, your attention will be riveted to that path, and enslaved in exchange for your survival.\nA steady paycheck. A spouse that, intrinsically, you have nothing in common with. And, of course, too much responsibility\u2026 that way you can\u2019t invest attention in your own thing.\nSociety is well aware of humans\u2019 mechanical nature.\nBy pursuing your own thing, it will become easier with time.\nThis isn\u2019t supposed to be an easy process.\nSome would even argue that raising your consciousness is the meaning of life.\nYou raise your consciousness by questioning everything, gaining awareness of a potential future, and learning to deal with those highs and lows\u2026 for life.\nYou raise your consciousness even more by creating a holistic identity, like humanity or the cosmos, and expanding your mind to embody that perspective.\nYour behavior will follow, and true problems will reveal themselves that you can solve through creativity.\nChallenge \u2013 The Source Of Wisdom And Evolution\nYour personal actualization hierarchy \u2013 purpose, process, and priority \u2013 should be challenging.\nMany conventional goals are challenging at the start, but that challenge soon fades. And, those challenges aren\u2019t something you actually want to take on.\nChallenge narrows attention further. This helps eliminate distractions from taking you off the path.\nEvery subsequent goal that your process presents to actualize your vision will demand you to grow.\nThat is, you will have to invest in your education to acquire the skill set required to meet that goal\u2019s challenge.\nThe source of learning is struggle, not memorization.\nThis isn\u2019t a corporate gig where you stop evolving at a certain rung in the ladder. Avoid mindless repetition without progression.\nClarity \u2013 Self-Correcting With Time\nIf creating your purpose, process, and priorities does not come easy to you, don\u2019t fall into the quick fix mindset.\nNone of this is easy.\nNone of this is immediate.\nNone of this will be crystal clear at the start.\nYou can predict the future, but it\u2019s impossible to have a perfect prediction.\nThis is LIFE we are talking about, not DAY.\nIt\u2019s going to take time, and if you haven\u2019t already, go back and write all of this down to the best of your ability.\nSelf-reflection will be your best friend on this journey.\nEvery month, go back to what you wrote down.\nReflect on what went right and what went wrong.\nBut understand, in the moment, there are not right or wrong choices. There is no way you can know with 100% certainty where your actions are going to lead. Get comfortable with the uncertain nature of life.\nExperience is how you refine your purpose with time. That is how you create your own certainty (in your ability).\nYou don\u2019t know what to improve if you don\u2019t make mistakes.\nAwareness begets awareness.\nAlignment \u2013 Extrinsic Potential With Intrinsic Progression\nThe top pyramid \u2013 purpose, process, priority \u2013 creates a potential reality for you to create through your daily choices.\nThese are responsible for extrapersonal neurotransmitters like dopamine.\nThe bottom pyramid \u2013 consciousness, challenge, and clarity \u2013 create an ever increasing order in your mind.\nThese are responsible for peripersonal neurotransmitters like endorphins.\nWhen these align, you create a neurochemical cocktail that continues circulating in your brain. It becomes much easier to live in some degree of a flow state, with your focus on the future and little to sway you from the path.\nYou align these pyramids through attention.\nMeaning, you have to create time to work toward your dreams, reflect on your progress, and refine your strategy.\nSwap out the mindless consumption for future building.\nLive in the mental reality that you\u2019ve created for yourself.\nThis Is Your Reality \u2013 A Note About The Focus Formula\nThis does not only apply to your life.\nIt applies to anything you do.\nIf you are building a side business, you need a purpose, process, priorities, and the rest.\nIf you are writing an article, you need the same. Even the structure of said article is the same. You communicate with the external world through persuasive actualization hierarchies.\nThis is a meta formula for operating at your highest potential on the macro and micro scale of life.\nLastly, this is your reality.\nThe Focus Formula you have created is what you bring your attention back to when distractions happen.\nKeep your head down in your little world, aiming for your purpose, and others opinions will stop holding weight.\nGet focused.\nPut on your headphones, throw up your hood, let people criticize, and focus on creating a better future for yourself and the world.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "Ever since I can remember, I\u2019ve been obsessed with learning.\nYes, even years ago when I was playing video games for 3-6 hours a day.\nI always carved out time to learn. A lot of it took away from the quality of my school work or job \u2013 but somehow I always knew that the knowledge acquisition would pay off.\nAt first, I thought my thirst for learning was shiny object syndrome.\nYou know\u2026 the \u201cdangerous\u201d thing that every successful person warns against.\nBut, if my bursts of obsession were true shiny object syndrome I wouldn\u2019t be where I am now.\nMy path has led to something I couldn\u2019t fathom as a teen.

Don\u2019t get trapped thinking that you can\u2019t replace your income early on in your journey (If you build in the real world, in front of real people, as you learn.)\nTo start, let\u2019s not mistake shiny object syndrome for skill stacking.\nSkill stacking > being a specialist > doing nothing at all because you\u2019re afraid of saturation, automation, or any other excuse that leads to distraction.\nSkill stacking allows you to build a creative solution to almost any burning problem on the market.\nI can get better results than a specialist agency simply because I have more awareness of the domain.\nI know how A will impact B will impact C and so on throughout the alphabet (and how the alphabet makes sense from a cosmic perspective.) Specialists tend to understand how A impacts B, but when it gets to C\u2026 things start to get fuzzy, which leads to limited results, even if those results are above average to the person receiving them.\nWe\u2019ll talk about why that\u2019s the case toward the end, but first, we have to understand what skills to learn (and in what order).\nStacking Evergreen Skills For Profitability\nIf you follow success-oriented social media accounts, you\u2019ve probably been screamed at to learn certain skills.\n\u201cStart an agency!\u201d\n\u201cLearn Facebook ads!\u201d\n\u201cStart a personal brand!\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t bad advice, but I want to propose a different approach.\nSo, let\u2019s zoom out and go meta.\nFor profitability, you will be exchanging value for value (in the forms of money, time, social leverage, information, or expertise).\nYou will be exchanging this value with other humans.\nAt the top of everything, human nature and psychology reign supreme.\nSo, we need 3 things:\n1) A valuable message \u2013 a way to communicate with others that is relevant, understandable, or actionable.\n2) A medium for distribution \u2013 a way of putting your valuable message in front of people (or else nobody sees your value).\n3) A results-oriented skill \u2013 a way for delivering a transformation to the people you have attracted with 1 and 2.\nMessage, medium, and applicability.\nThese are all skills that interact with and enhance one another. Without one, you won\u2019t get results. This is why it takes 6+ months to feel like you know what you are doing. You can\u2019t just learn a skill and expect people to come to you (and then buy from you).\nThe Message\nPeople, especially creators, tend to glance over the fact that people can become interested in anything.\nSelf-awareness and reflection are key here.\nIf you\u2019re interested in a weird topic, how did you become interested in it? Were you just born with that interest? Of course not. So how can you get others interested and attract an audience large enough to make a living from it?\nIf your words aren\u2019t resonating with others, it\u2019s not them, it\u2019s you.\nYou are either:\nSpeaking from an advanced level (when 95% of the market are beginners).\nDon\u2019t understand persuasion. You have to answer or imply an answer to the question \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\nDidn\u2019t capture their attention and deliver a valuable message to that attention.\nFor the last point, \u201cvalue\u201d does not always mean actionable.\nValue can be described by the key pillars of content creation.\nEducate, entertain, and inspire.\nEntertainment is just as valuable (to some) as education.\nAnd, \u201centertaining\u201d doesn\u2019t mean humorous. A relevant statistic or fun fact that captures attention can be entertaining. Learning something new is a form of entertainment.\nThere are 2 skills to study if you want to craft a valuable message:\n1) Marketing \u2013 creating a message that is attention-grabbing, relevant, and valuable for a specific person.\n2) Sales \u2013 a process for making people aware of their problems and presenting a solution to those problems. Notice how you don\u2019t just target people that are automatically aware of everything you do. It\u2019s a process.\nSales can also be synonymous with storytelling.\nThey both imply a transformation by overcoming problems in a unique way.\nFor the sake of brevity, this letter will not go into each and every skill, that would be impossible to accomplish in one letter.\nBut, in the last section, I will show you how to best learn these skills.\nIf you want my marketing and sales systems that I use to create and launch profitable offers, check out Digital Economics.\nThe Medium\nIn life, discipline = freedom (shoutout Jocko).\nIn business, distribution = freedom.\nWith an internet business, distribution comes from the combination of media and code.\nCoding is a great high-value skill to learn, especially when paired with marketing know-how.\nBuilding software, distributing it online, and actually getting users through marketing is a superhuman skill stack. Most coders only know the technical side, but not the human side.\nHowever, many of you here are going down the creative route.\nIn this case, keep in mind that you will need technical know-how for the software you choose to use.\nYou will have to learn no-code tools (like website builders, course platforms, note-taking apps, and organizational tools) to maximize the effect of your skill stack.\nYour message, from above, is what leads to engagement, impact, and sales.\nBut if you don\u2019t have a medium for distribution, people aren\u2019t going to see that message, obviously.\nThis is where I went wrong in the past. I was too focused on perfecting my product or service.\nThe result?\nNo sales, of course. I didn\u2019t have a plan to get traffic to my freelance service with an overly fancy website, logo, and 3 months of \u201cwork\u201d down the drain.\nAnd, I didn\u2019t have any data. I was creating a product blindly without testing first (with content and an audience).\nNow, in this letter, we are taking a meta-approach.\nYou build distribution by growing top-of-funnel social media channels.\nWe talk about distribution and leverage in The One Person Business Roadmap.\nThis can be any of them, but I would recommend beginners start with a social platform that allows you to control growth.\nYouTube, podcasts, and blogs are great\u2026 but they take time to build. I would save them for later in your journey. Treat them as authority-building platforms and let them grow with time.\nAt the start, I would highly recommend Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn\u2026 Twitter being my favorite. The only skill you need is writing while learning other skills along the way.\nThe principles of these \u201cgrowth\u201d social platforms are the same. You need:\nA valuable message\nEyeballs on that message\nConsistent effort on getting your content shared\nA brand that looks like it should have 1 million followers\nFancy tactics for rapid growth are great. But, it\u2019s better to focus on creating content that will bring in followers on any platform.\nSo, the medium for distributing your message comes before the social media platform.\nWriting and speaking.\nThose are the mediums for distributing your message.\nWhen paired with marketing and sales you get copywriting and persuasive speaking.\nThis is the foundation of all of my social media growth. Written newsletters are scripts for YouTube. Written tweets are scripts for reels (and can be copy-pasted to all other platforms.)\nIn 2 Hour Writer, I show exactly how I write a long-form newsletter, deconstruct it into engaging tweets, and distribute that writing across all platforms.\nALL of my social media growth is based on my writing.\nSpeaking comes second (which I base on the written scripts).\nOther skills to help illustrate that message come third.\nSo, start writing to articulate your message. Build distribution on social media. Then practice speaking when you are ready.\nResults Oriented Skills\nBy now, we understand that you need an attractive, valuable, and persuasive message paired with a medium for distribution.\nThat is all you need, but you can enhance these skills by applying them in specific ways.\nEmail marketing\nSales closing\nGraphic design\nVideography\nAnimation\nWeb design\nIn short, you learn how to apply the medium and message \u2013 to your own or someone else\u2019s business \u2013 with technology.\nEvery business needs specific technology to pull in customers on the internet.\nWhen you understand how those pieces work, you can deliver specific results through that technology.\nYou can write emails that pull in more customers.\nYou can create graphics that pull in more followers.\nYou can create videos that hold more attention.\nYou unlock a new level of power when you pair marketing, sales, and communication with a specific technology that can be leveraged for what everyone wants:\nMoney, followers, reputation, opportunity, freedom, and status as a whole.\nStacking Personal Interests For Individuality\nIn these letters, I talk about turning yourself into the niche and building a personal brand.\nBut, this can also apply when you are trying to sell to a different customer avatar, person, or business.\nWith a personal brand, your interests are what make you unique.\nWhen you have an offer to sell, your interests help you niche down who you sell to.\nIf I\u2019m interested in fitness, I attract people interested in fitness. Meaning, I can introduce them to my other interests.\nSince I understand the fitness scene, I know a LOT about my target customer. I can piece together an offer for fitness coaches and help them get better results. And, that just sounds more enjoyable than working with a business you despise for the sake of money.\nAnd, if I\u2019m already attracting fitness people by talking about fitness (rather than just business) then my target audience IS my audience.\nMy interest is fitness, so I incorporate content on that to make myself more unique.\nMy target customer is a fitness coach, who are attracted through my fitness content. Since they are in my audience, I can educate and sell them on my business-related offer.\nSee how that works?\nMany people are afraid to incorporate their interests into a focused brand.\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t get good engagement?\u201d\nThen it isn\u2019t interesting enough. You aren\u2019t hitting a relevant pain point and why they should care. Anyone can become interested in anything.\nBroaden the topic and speak to a beginner level.\n(Yes, this will still attract advanced-level people. I\u2019m advanced in fitness but still need to be reminded of the fundamentals, so I consume basic fitness content.)\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t make as many sales?\u201d\nAre you hard promoting with every single post? No.\nOn a 5-year time scale, if 20% of your posts are about a specific interest, do you really think that is going to impact overall revenue?\nHint: it doesn\u2019t, and if anything, it contributes to more sales because you aren\u2019t hyper-focused on one thing like everyone else.\n\u201cWhat if my interest has nothing to do with the thing that makes me money?\u201d\nGet creative. Use it as a way to help people understand.\nLike when I talk about creators being like DJs.\nI like EDM, but that isn\u2019t related to business. So I note common patterns and make business more interesting with it.\nStacking Experience For Nuance & Navigation\nNothing happens, then everything happens.\nWhen you are on the path of mastery, not in one skill, but one domain\u2026 your life, you will experience this lesson multiple times.\nFrom the book Mastery by George Leonard, mastery is \u201cthe mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice.\u201d\nThis is the opposite of instant gratification \u2013 and why it is so difficult to internalize without action.\nI am not going to baby you here and give exact steps for immediate reward.\nI am, however, going to give you the meta-skills necessary for this path.\nYour job:\nHold these in your mind while on the path.\nWhen things get difficult, remind yourself that it is a part of the process.\nBy sticking things out, you will experience short bursts of intense progress. Lean into those. Enjoy them.\nBursts Of Building\nThe 2 skills that will help you learn the skills above are rapid learning and rapid execution.\nCombined, we can consider these skills as one:\nBuilding.\nI wrote an entire letter on this, you should read it\u2026 or watch it.\nIn short, here\u2019s what you do:\nChoose a project to emulate. This should incorporate the skills you are trying to learn.\nStart building your own version. Create an outline for your project and build until you hit a wall.\nSeek specific knowledge. When you hit a wall, learn the skills necessary for that specific real-world situation. This helps you cut through the fluff that can be learned through experience.\nBonus: teach along the way. Teaching will identify your knowledge gaps, meaning you can seek more specific knowledge.\nMy favorite way of integrating everything we\u2019ve learned in this letter is by building a one-person business.\nWhy?\nIt\u2019s obvious to me, but not to those that haven\u2019t started.\nYou get to practice all skills mentioned on your own business.\nWriting, speaking, marketing, sales, and complementary skills like design, video, or email.\nYou write content, sales pages, and promotions.\nYou market your own Minimum Viable Offer (or affiliate product, you don\u2019t have to have your own) and get data to improve.\nYou design your profile picture, banner, product assets, and more.\nYour one-person business success is determined by your ability to learn as you build.\nThen, with that skill stack, you can create an irresistible offer for almost any online business\u2026 or just monetize what you\u2019ve built on the way.\nTending To Your Perspective\n1% of 50 years is 6 months.\nAnd 6 months is just the start of the beginning.\nIf you are on the path of mastery, you are on it for life.\nWhen you open your mind beyond surface-level living, you can finally see the depth, enjoyment, and reflection of life that the path of mastery presents.\nI mentioned earlier that shiny object syndrome isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nThe \u201cbad\u201d shiny objects are the ones that take you off the path.\nLearning a new skill that can complement your current ones is not bad.\nYour skills compound, and nobody can take them away from you.\nWhen a distraction registers in your awareness, and you allow your focus to narrow in on it, you close your mind to the depth of your craft.\nThe distractions are just that, a temporary bump in the path.\nBecause once you\u2019ve started, you will always come back to it, as that is the only way to achieve what you want in this life.\nThe most important pattern to notice here is this:\nNothing happens, then everything happens.\nMastery is a cyclical process of slow, or no, progress followed by exponential leaps in progress.\nIn business, the first exponential leap happens after 6 months of consistent effort. This is followed by massive resistance. You will feel like you aren\u2019t getting anywhere.\nZoom out.\nNotice that the months of potential despair are a part of the journey.\nNobody said you aren\u2019t supposed to feel good (or bad).\nNobody said it\u2019s going to be easy (or hard).\nNobody said you are supposed to be rich (or poor).\nThose are expectations you hold in your mind.\nSee beyond them.\nGradual Awareness Of The Domain\nEverything we\u2019ve discussed is a guide until solidified with direct experience.\n\u201cNothing happens, then everything happens\u201d is just a feel-good saying until you truly experience it.\nWhen you learn one skill, a field of awareness opens around it.\nLike a candle in a dark room.\nThis allows you to see the next step forward, and leads to the next skill, broadening your field of awareness further.\nThe candle turns into two.\nThen three, four, and so on.\nSoon enough, you\u2019re able to navigate a large portion of what used to be a dark room.\nNothing happens (pieces of the puzzle that form an ugly mess) then everything happens (a piece clicks into place that forms an image you can make sense of).\nThis \u201cfield of awareness\u201d is where you can help others, build creative solutions, and map your journey.\nCommit to the path.\nStack evergreen skills (medium, message, and results)\nStack personal interests (for individuality)\nStack experience (for nuance and navigation)\nGive yourself 20 years, not 2 weeks.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhen you\u2019re ready, visit my site for free tools and products for building a life that you control."

        "heading": "The 4-Hour Workday (Focused Work Changed My Life)",
        "content": "Quick update:\nDigital Economics is now open to the public. You can enroll at any time (rather than waiting until February).\nYou can also download Digital Economics 101 for free. It is a mini-course to get you up to speed on the new economy.\nIf you\u2019re interested in productizing yourself with the systems I\u2019ve refined with 3 years of creator experience, consider enrolling.\nCheck out Digital Economics.\nWhen I was in college trying to become a fitness YouTuber (of all things), I remember seeing the title of a popular book by Tim Ferris.\nThe 4-Hour Work Week.\nI\u2019ve never read the book, but for some odd reason I interpreted it as \u201c4-Hour Work Day.\u201d\nThe idea of a 4 hour work day stuck in my mind throughout college and my plethora of business failures.\nSubconsciously, I was making decisions to limit how much I work to 4 hours each day.\nThis alone changed the direction of my life.\nWhy?\nFirst, I perceived anything more than 4 hours of work as a problem.\nFew people do this. Most people label this lifestyle as \u201cimpossible\u201d and then it becomes so.\nThis has forced my mind to work on a creative solution for that problem to eliminate, systemize, or automate low-leverage work.\nIn business, that means outsourcing, productizing, or building more leverage \u2013 so that\u2019s what I did.\nI grew on social media, pivoted out of time-sucking client work, and productized my offers so they could sell in my sleep (with the leverage I built).\nAs of right now, I\u2019m working overtime.\n4-hour workdays are a blessing, but sometimes you need a 16-hour laser-focused forgot-to-eat marathon to see what you are capable of building.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 30, 2021\nFor the past 3 years, I\u2019ve worked less than 4 hours a day for 90% of my days.\nRecently, I\u2019ve hit new monthly highs in revenue that are unsustainable with 4 hours of work.\nAnd, I\u2019ve started building a new software that requires more of my attention.\nBut, you can bet your a** that I am constantly thinking of creative ways to reduce my time spent (while maintaining the value of what I\u2019ve built).\nSecond, as we do with these letters, it goes a lot deeper than just \u201c4 hours of focused work.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s dive into some philosophy, evolutionary psychology, and why they matter for the future of work \u2013 specifically in the new digital economy.\nThen, toward the end of the letter, we\u2019ll get into my 10 commandments of focused work.\nPreface: If you don\u2019t have 4 hours to dedicate to your business, you can apply these principles to your current job\u2026 or on the 1-2 hours that you have to work on your business.\nTaking Advantage Of What Makes Us Different\nThere are many things that make humans stand out from other beings.\nLike how we survive on a conceptual level, while animals survive on a physical level. (You wouldn\u2019t see a snake feel threatened because it disagrees with your opinions.)\nBut, one difference that has always fascinated me is a human\u2019s depth of focus.\nIn psychology, there is the Task Positive Network and the Default Mode Network.\nThe Task Positive Network \u201ckicks on\u201d when our focus narrows in on a string of external goals or tasks.\nThis is helpful with productivity.\nThe Default Mode Network kicks on when our focus shifts inward and expands to allow more thoughts & ideas to register in our awareness.\nThis is helpful with creativity.\n(Remember these for later).\nBut, there are negative aspects of this mysterious spectrum of focus.\nLike when you narrow in on a problem and it expands to fill your attention. This closes your mind off to potential creative solutions. A small problem soon becomes your entire world.\nOr, when you open your focus and hold multiple ideas in your awareness.\nIf those ideas are not connected, ordered, or just don\u2019t make sense \u2013 chaos ensues. You can get sucked into a downward spiral of overwhelm, anxiety, and difficulty seeing beyond the bubble of problems you\u2019ve created.\nThis phenomenon doesn\u2019t only happen in the mind.\nOur body follows.\nYou can narrow, contract, or deepen the focus of your physical being by touching something with the tip of your finger.\nYou can open, expand, or widen the focus of your physical being by opening your body in a confident manner.\nLike how we can throw a dart and hit a bullseye, we can take action toward a vision for our future.\nThat is if the skill, clarity, and awareness are there to make that vision a reality. Because it can quickly overwhelm you and lead to procrastination.\nAnd one last example:\nWe can narrow or widen our perspective or worldview.\nWe can be \u201copen-minded\u201d or \u201cclosed-minded\u201d depending on how we approach a situation.\nYou can open your mind to the idea of working 4 hours or less \u2013 or you can give up, make excuses, and blame everyone but yourself until you do.\nSurvival Systems\nEvolution is forced on us by the fact that systems fall apart with time unless they become more efficient. We can\u2019t stop and remain in the same place; even to remain still we must advance. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nAs humans, we have a natural desire for more.\nWe need to survive at all costs.\nEvolution reflects this.\nWith our unique minds, we build systems to aid in survival.\nIt takes a lot of energy to carry water and plow fields, so we built systems to use that energy with efficiency.\n(Irrigation systems, tractors, and every other system that had to be built in order for those things to even be possible).\nSystems layer on top of each other to make our mind more efficient. We get better at \u2018investing\u2019 our mental energy.\nLet me introduce you to the supreme law of the universe:\nEntropy.\nSome call it \u201cnature\u2019s tax.\u201d\nIn brief, entropy is the measure of disorder in a system.\nWith time, the energy that would maintain a system disperses, and the system dissolves into chaos (unless quality energy is added).\nLike a library compared to your home book collection.\nThe library is systemized.\nIt uses energy efficiently to alphabetize, organize, and make the books on the shelf easy for readers to find.\nLibraries have workers that maintain this system, and one day, we may create a robot that can do the job better (while saving energy like time, money, and the mental bandwidth of library managers).\nYour home book collection may be organized, but what happens when you take one book out? Do you put it back after you read it? What happens when you take out 2 more?\nDo you have a system that eases the mental cost of keeping your personal library maintained?\nHave you used that system enough to spot problems, solve them, and engraine the system into the neural networks of your brain \u2013 to the point of it becoming habit?\nBooks may end up in separate rooms of your house and your bookshelf becomes unorganized.\nWithout a good system that orders consciousness, an ever-growing energy requirement to order the bookshelf will lead to anxiety, overwhelm and stress.\nWhat does this have to do with focused work and productivity?\nIf you don\u2019t systemize your path to success, you won\u2019t achieve it.\nYour productivity system is one out of many that you will make more efficient with time.\nProductivity is about getting from point A to point B as fast as possible.\nLike your home bookshelf, if you don\u2019t have a system for your work, you will get overwhelmed with the tasks in front of you.\nWhen you are overwhelmed, if you don\u2019t have a system for your mind, the intensity of that overwhelm will increase.\nNow that entropy has its grasp on your productivity, it may lead to a week-long downward spiral of emotions and laziness\u2026 nobody wants that.\nThe 4-Hour Philosophy \u2013 My 10 Commandments For Focused Work\nHumans survive on a conceptual level.\nWe have the desire to build systems to survive the mental constructions that we create \u2013 the \u201cself\u201d being one of them.\nWe attach to a concept, make it a part of our identity, and open up room for suffering.\nThis is not always a bad thing.\nYou have a self.\nYou have an ego.\nAnd unless you plan to become a monk (who still go through similar worldly struggles, from what I\u2019ve read\u2026 we\u2019ll never have access to their state of mind so who knows. Better to just experiment for ourselves) then we must use this knowledge to our advantage.\nIf you were to loosely identify with a positive version of success and the projects that will take you there:\nYou will have the desire to build systems to aid in the survival of those concepts.\nIf you create a vision for your future, you will subconsciously work to survive that vision.\nIf you create a project that will help you actualize that vision, you will work to survive that project.\nIf you create an identity that makes the automatic decision to build that project for 4 hours every day, you will work to survive that identity.\nWhy? Because if you don\u2019t survive the things that make you, you\u2026 then you cease to exist.\nThe concept of \u201cdeath,\u201d which we can\u2019t experience, fills us with fear.\nWe can either transmute that fear or be a slave to it.\nSo, let\u2019s take a meta approach to productivity.\nWith the steps below, you can begin to craft a productivity system that allows you to actualize your vision for success.\n1) Why 4 Hours?\nConceptual systems need mental energy to thrive.\nFrom personal experience, scientific studies, and anecdotes from my time spent in the productivity space\u2026 3-4 hours is the sweet spot for mental energy expenditure.\nSome studies show that 5-6 hours is the top end.\nBut, 3-4 hours of hyper-focus creates a deadline for your work, which narrows attention further and helps curb distraction.\nStart with 4 hours as your goal.\n2) Vision & Identity\nThis is for another letter, and we\u2019ve discussed it previously, but you need an MVV.\nA Minimum Viable Vision.\nYou won\u2019t have absolute clarity on it the first time around.\nWrite out the following (be as specific and detailed as you can):\nWho you want to be\nWhat you want to do for work\nWhere you want to live\nWhat your ideal day looks like\nHow you will contribute to humanity\nWhat people you will surround yourself with (network and social circle)\nFeel free to keep the stream of consciousness going by answering more questions that come to mind.\nWhen your actions begin to habitually align with your vision, your character development will follow.\n3) Outline 3 Lever Moving Tasks\nThis is situation-dependent.\nYou will have to gain a big-picture understanding of the tasks necessary to reach the next stage of your business development.\nAs a creator, read this One Person Business Roadmap to know what to execute on as a beginner, intermediate, or advanced\nHere are my lever movers for my current stage in business:\nWriting content \u2013 I write my newsletter every single morning. This writing gets broken down and repurposed for all platforms (this is in 2 Hour Writer, an efficient system for content creation).\nGenerating traffic \u2013 Growth isn\u2019t automatic when you start on a certain platform. Since I have my smallest audience on LinkedIn, I network with people to get eyes on my content.\nPromoting my products \u2013 With consistent traffic on all platforms, I promote my offers, directly or indirectly, once a day (all 3 of these are systemized in Digital Economics).\nThis ensures that my business continues to grow and sustainable sales are coming in.\nIt also helps to attach a specific number to these, like \u201cwriting 1000 words.\u201d\nI write 1 section of my newsletter every morning. I know exactly who to message and DM. I promote my products once a day.\nThose are quantifiable to my brain.\nDependent on your vision, business model, and experience level which quantifiable tasks will yield the most progress?\n4) Gain Clarity On Those Tasks\nA few times a week, you will have to exchange lever-moving tasks for clarity-generating tasks.\nEvery Sunday and Monday, I exchange my newsletter writing for outlining and research.\nIn the afternoons I will consume content revolving around my interests. This is for idea generation.\nIn the evenings (sometimes mornings) I outline exactly what I\u2019m going to get done. When I wake up, my mind is set on that plan.\nI talk about this balance in my Fill Empty Use framework.\nWith a systemized supply of good ideas, there is no friction when I outline and write my newsletters.\nHow can you use 1-2 hours of your week to set yourself up for seamless work sessions?\n5) Timeblocks & Breaks\nAt the start, before it becomes habit, put these time blocks on your calendar and set reminders.\nThis is something you can test.\nI\u2019ve found that 90 minutes of focus with 15-30 minute breaks are the sweet spot for me.\nI\u2019ll work on my priority tasks for that time, go on a short walk, and get straight back into work for another 90 minutes.\nYou can schedule these 90-minute blocks throughout the day if you want.\nBut, be mindful that distractions are more abundant when the world is awake.\n6) Manipulate Deadlines\nDeadlines narrow your attention.\nNarrow attention (on an outcome that you have clarity to achieve) increases the potential for flow.\nThe flow state is like nitrous for focused work.\n4 hours of total work and 90-minute time blocks may do the job, but you can constrain your attention more.\nPut something tangible on the line and let everyone know.\nIf I set a date for a product launch and accept presale payments, there is no way in hell that everything related to the product launch is not getting done.\nGet creative. How can you add a real deadline to your work? This can be long or short-term.\n7) Manipulate Environment\nYour environment must be conducive to your work sessions.\nBefore work, I have exact steps for what I do after I wake up:\nBrush my teeth and shower\nWalk and feed the dog\nMake coffee and write\nThis helps reduce decision fatigue and distraction potential before the work session.\nWhile working, my environment is curated to narrow my focus on the task at hand:\nA clear workspace\nNice headphones and lyric-less music (like dubstep, complexity also narrows focus by \u201ctuning out\u201d and not listening to the song)\nNo physical items \u2013 like my phone or reminders \u2013 that will break my attention.\nHow can you manipulate your environment to conserve mental energy for your priority tasks?\n8) Wake Up Before The Distractions\nDistractions are the start of entropy in your productivity system.\nThe more distractions you give the chance to penetrate your awareness, the more likely you will be to go into a downward spiral of procrastination.\nThis is my most effective productivity advice:\nWake up 1-2 hours earlier.\nEven if you\u2019re a night owl (leverage your sleepy open focused brain for creative work, rather than technical work).\nEven though you\u2019re allowed to ignore messages and not touch your phone\u2026\nNobody will be texting, calling, or trying to get a hold of you. That alone will hedge against getting sucked into social apps. Because your phone won\u2019t require your attention.\n9) Prioritize Rest\nQuality work doesn\u2019t exist without quality rest. Simple as that.\nBut as we\u2019ve discussed in my balanced daily routine letter:\n\u201cRest\u201d does not mean Netflix, wine, and bubble baths.\nRest = regenerating mental energy through non-work related activities like:\nGoing to the gym\nGoing on a walk\nSocializing with friends\nReading a good book\nTrying a new hobby\nAnything that doesn\u2019t support mediocrity or a cheap dopamine habit.\nAnother important thing with this:\nWhen your 4 hours of work are up, stop working.\nDead stop. No excuses.\nBreak the habit of needing to work past your assigned hours.\nIf you can\u2019t because your business will explode, that\u2019s a problem.\nFix it (with a system).\n10) Make Your System More Efficient\nIf you have so much work that you can\u2019t work 4 hours or less (given that you want to), again, that\u2019s a problem.\nProblems require creativity and systemization.\nAKA, another reason to prioritize rest so the Default Mode Network in your brain can help solve the problem.\nYou will have to implement solutions to test and refine with time.\nIf I can\u2019t work less than 4 hours because of client work, then I have to:\nBuild a larger audience\nCreate a product that doesn\u2019t require my time\nPromote and improve that product until sustainable\nTake on less clients with my new free time\nYou would be correct in assuming that this isn\u2019t instant. Be patient.\nSo, last question:\nWhat is preventing you from working 4 hours a day and what can you do to change that?\nYou will have to work harder before you can work smarter.\nYou will have to work smarter before you don\u2019t consider it work at all.\n11) Bonus: Leverage Digital Tools\nOnce you have the money to invest in automation software, you should.\nBulk schedule content with software like TweetHunter.\nWrite out, organize, and refine your systems in Notion.\nWhen problems come up, like emails taking too long to go through, seek specific knowledge on how to free that time up \u2013 don\u2019t just accept your fate.\nInstead of distracting yourself, learn in alignment with your top-of-mind problems.\nMy Challenge For You\nWrite down these commandments and execute.\nDon\u2019t just read this without applying the information.\n4-hour workdays are more than possible for those that craft their lifestyle in that direction.\nThe internet is an incredible tool if you use it to its full potential (rather than it using you).\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nDigital Economics is now open to the public.

        "content": "Before we begin: this letter is one of many in the one-person business series. Here are a few more.\nThe One-Person Business Model (How To Productize Yourself)\nThe Rise Of The Value Creator (A Career Path For Polymaths & Self Improvers)\n11 Insights I Wish I Knew As A Creator\nYou Have A $100,000 Product In Your Head\nAnd lastly, all of these are just interesting posts. They\u2019re valuable, yes, but the real value is in the systems I\u2019ve refined that maintain my little one-person business that pulls in +/- $100,000 a month.\nIf you want a Notion dashboard with these systems to manage your business (with full-fledged education on brand, content, product, marketing, and promotions), then you may enjoy Digital Economics.\nProductize yourself for the new economy by enrolling here.\nIf you\u2019re building a one-person creator business, pay attention.\nI\u2019ve been in this game for 3 years now.\nI\u2019ve seen accounts small and large disappear off the map.\nI\u2019ve seen small accounts make $100K a month.\nI\u2019ve seen large accounts make $1K a month.\nMost people see this and think of one or the other as bad.\nThat they should stick with a high-priced service and never have enough time on their hands, or gain a lot of followers and never make enough money to survive.\nThere is a crucial piece of the solopreneurship puzzle that nobody talks about.\nWhile most people think you have to sacrifice either time or money, I\u2019m here to tell you that you can have both.\nHow?\nDigital Leverage.\nLet me paint a picture of what I mean.\nWith 500K+ followers and a solid reputation, I can:\nReach out to almost anyone, even celebrities, and get a response.\nPromote a product, service, or message and have it reach 10x more than the followers I have.\nIncrease or decrease my income within a specific range with a strategic investment of time or money.\nIf I had to make $50K in 24 hours, I have the leverage to do so. Hell, if I really tried, I could make $100K in 24 hours without owing any favors or money to anyone, but I\u2019d probably have to cross some moral barriers. That doesn\u2019t feel good.\nAnd on special occasions, like Black Friday weekend, my little creator business pulled in $139,000 in revenue.\nThis wasn\u2019t always an option, and definitely wasn\u2019t an option before I had a lot of followers.\nJK Molina talks about how \u201clikes ain\u2019t cash,\u201d which is true, but cash alone ain\u2019t leverage.\nNow, of course, as with anything I talk about, this is goal dependent.\nIf you want to create content around your interests, not hire employees, and unlock an abundance of time & money\u2026 this is for you.\nIf your goals are different, don\u2019t let a few flashy screenshots distract you from carving your own path.\nThe Mental Monopoly\nThe Internet enables eight billion monopolies. \u2013 Naval\nTo make things simple, your \u201cpersonal brand\u201d is based on what you want out of life.\nThe thing you are leading your followers toward.\nEveryone has the same desires.\nThey\u2019re all based around the eternal markets:\nHealth\nWealth\nRelationships\nBonus: Happiness\nThe first 3 are survival or actualization based (see: Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy Of Needs).\nThe last is transcendence based (see: the next phase of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy that he had plans to complete before his death).\nThese markets are where burning problems exist. The ones that are relevant, profitable, and evergreen. Everyone has either conscious or subconscious goals relating to these markets.\nNow, we don\u2019t want to be a normal old \u201cpersonal brand,\u201d we want to be a personal monopoly.\nYour long-term success as a creator depends on the mental monopoly you create that occupies a small chunk of the collective consciousness.\nIrreplaceable is a good word.\nHow do we become irreplaceable?\nBy pursuing your genuine curiosity.\nThat\u2019s what makes you, you.\nAnd if you are the only \u2018you\u2019 on this planet, your niche of one is already carved out.\nBut, most people can\u2019t pursue their curiosity. At least not consistently.\nWhy?\nBecause their attention is being manhandled by their base psychological needs.\nSelf-actualization is a need, not a want, for living a good life.\nYour future isn\u2019t about competition with others, it\u2019s about competition with your distracted mind.\nMeaning, an exceptional future belongs to those that can master their survival, pursue their genuine curiosity, and pass down what they learned.\nSo:\nImprove yourself\nSolve your own problems\nMaster your survival\nDocument your journey\nPursue your curiosity and separate yourself from the crowd\nHow you do this is unique to you.\nIf your goal is financial freedom, your path will not be the same as others. Your story is what turns you into a niche of one.\nIf you and I both achieved financial freedom through different skills, interests, and lessons learned through struggle, we would have a drastically different story to tell.\nThis story is valuable to the generation under us, and is crucial for your brand success.\nWhy is this important?\nBecause that is what we are here to do.\nSelf-actualize and transcend.\nPass down your lessons.\nHelp others get there faster.\nDo good for humanity and receive good back.\nIf enough people do this, imagine what kind of world you can help create.\nIf more people solve their base survival needs, they open up room for creative problem solving.\nCreativity, innovation, and discovery through the pursuit of curiosity are what will take us into the next phase of evolution, whatever it may be.\nDistribution = Freedom\nBuild distribution, then build whatever you want \u2013 Jack Butcher\n\u201cDistribution,\u201d from the lens of a creator business, is the potential traffic you can send to a product, service, or crevice of the internet.\nThere are 3 types of distribution:\nBuilt, borrowed, and bought.\nYou build distribution by growing an audience with internet content. Then, you can (and should) take it a step further by \u201cde-platforming\u201d your audience.\nYou de-platform by funneling your audience to a community or newsletter. These can be free or paid.\nSocial media platforms can go *poof* at any time. Your account can get suspended, you can get canceled, or you may just hate social media enough to leave.\nBut, they can\u2019t take an off-platform community or email list away from you. And, these are your most dedicated readers, so it\u2019s better to give them the most value and attention anyway.\nYou borrow distribution by leveraging other people\u2019s audience, community, or newsletter.\nYou can be hosted on their podcast and plug your offers.\nOr, your ideas can be so unique that they mention you on their podcast without you being there. They can give credit to your ideas in their posts, newsletters, and even a full-fledged book at times.\nThis is the game you eventually want to play. Make your ideas so contagious that your distribution continues to grow without any manual effort.\nLet your ideas live in peoples\u2019 heads rent-free.\nYou buy distribution in many different ways.\nThe various options for paid ads are the obvious ones, but not the most powerful.\nYou can buy sponsorship spots on podcasts, newsletters, and YouTube videos.\nYou can also buy paid shares like retweets, Instagram stories, or even \u201cwatch next\u201d slots on YouTube videos. I haven\u2019t tried this one for those wondering, my recent YouTube growth happened out of nowhere (but I\u2019m not opposed to testing it out).\nThe last one, paid growth, is my favorite because it usually results in a large number of engaged people following you. You don\u2019t tell them to follow you, they follow because your content is good. This compounds with time and crosses over with \u201cbuilt\u201d distribution.\nThe common objection to this is \u201ccheating,\u201d which is usually spouted by those that aren\u2019t in the creator game. If your brand, content, or product suck you\u2019re not going to grow, sell, or be seen as any kind of authority.\nBought traffic compounds the results, ideas, and time in the game you already have.\nThat image is my current distribution network.\nI have 500K+ followers across multiple platforms, 40K+ newsletter subscribers, and a product stack that allows me to comfortably fund my desired lifestyle.\nOne thing that way too many people forget:\nYour audience is not just your audience.\nThe Network Effect is extremely powerful.\nI don\u2019t only have access to my following.\nI have indirect access to the followers of every person following me \u2013 many of those people being micro-celebrities or others with 100K+ audiences.\nI also have access to those that people share my content with digitally or by word of mouth.\nAnd, I have access to the \u201cfollowers\u201d of everyone that follows me. To a lesser extent, of course.\nThe point being, my ideas have the small potential of reaching any of the 4.5 billion people on the internet if (1) I\u2019m consistent (2) I prioritize creative ideas that stick.\nWith 500K followers, I have indirect access to 10X more potential traffic. The same holds true for smaller followings, they just don\u2019t realize it.\nProducts That Don\u2019t Require Time\nWe will discuss what product or service style you should be focused on in the next section, but let\u2019s understand this:\nYour income, lifestyle, and freedom are limited by the amount of time your products take to fulfill.\nWith a projected 62% of labor jobs being threatened by automation in the next decade, it makes sense that the highest-paid individuals will be those that prioritize selling their knowledge.\nWhen you have an absurd amount of distribution, but only have a service that requires your precious time, it\u2019s not going to be fun.\nYou don\u2019t have a product in place that can sell, fulfill, and maintain itself while you sleep. If you have an influx of traffic from someone else mentioning your ideas, like on a podcast, you are flushing money (and more leverage) down the drain.\nAnother thing:\nThe more people you help, the more leverage you have.\nIf people dig into your deep, valuable, and actionable ideas, systems, and advice \u2013 you hold more mental real estate.\nPeople that only sell high-ticket coaching, freelancing, or consulting don\u2019t have this power.\nLike how you will remember the author of your favorite book for the rest of your life.\nBooks, digital products, and high-value long-form content have a higher potential impact than servicing a few select people with freelancing or coaching.\nThe more impact you have on the world \u2013 the more attention you hold \u2013 the more leverage you have.\nInternet Content Is Idea Warfare On Mental Real Estate\nMost one-person business beginners don\u2019t see content for what it is.\nIt\u2019s not about catching attention.\nIt\u2019s not about getting the most followers.\nIt\u2019s not about having the most engagement.\nIt\u2019s about valuable ideas.\nValuable ideas = relevant, understandable, and actionable to the point of them being spread without personal effort.\nThe more perspective-shifting ideas you put out into the world, the more mental real estate you occupy.\nThe big problem:\nIt\u2019s common (and good) advice to steal high-performing ideas from other creators.\nI do this all the time.\nI steal ideas from:\nHigh performing YouTube videos \u2013 go to a channel you aspire to be like and filter their videos by most popular.\nMedium articles \u2013 Medium\u2019s algorithm gives you content based around your interests. You can get some incredible ideas just by skimming the home page.\nTop tweets \u2013 with Twemex or TweetHunter, you can filter any account\u2019s tweets and see what their highest performing content is.\nThose are a few common examples. The problem is a lack of balance, testing, and turning those ideas into your own through direct experience.\nI talk about this more in 2 Hour Writer.\nNow, let\u2019s understand the evolution of your journey.\nAs with all domains of life, there are developmental stages.\nThese stages have a certain set of opportunities available to them in alignment with their skills, results, and experience.\nA stage 1 creator can\u2019t send out an email and make $50K on demand like a stage 3 can. Nor can they DM anyone and get a response, have their choice of business opportunities in their DMs, or have the freedom to disappear for 3 months because they don\u2019t have clients to service.\nYou develop yourself and your business by consistently pushing the boundaries of what you know.\nPreface: All of these stages are made up from my observation over the years. They aren\u2019t set in stone and don\u2019t apply to everyone. And, this mainly applies to one person creator businesses that aren\u2019t starting their journey with prior business success.\nStage 1 Creators (Low Leverage)\nThis is where every single new creator starts.\nSocial media growth is formulaic. These stages will help you understand it more.\nMost people think they can\u2019t grow an audience, but they look at their favorite creator\u2019s content, know they have the same knowledge, and don\u2019t realize that social media is a skill that can be learned like any other with practice and persistence.\nHere\u2019s what to focus on in Stage 1 of your creator journey:\n1) High Performing Content\nYou need to understand what kind of content actually leads to growth.\nYou can\u2019t just start putting out whatever you feel like posting and expect it to do well because you are clever and artsy.\nIf you aren\u2019t growing, it\u2019s not the readers\u2019 fault for not understanding your writing, it\u2019s your fault for not writing in an understandable way.\nStudy popular tweets, viral content, and attention-grabbing headlines. Immerse yourself in them, deconstruct why they work, and start testing what you learn in your own content.\n2) Content Templates As Training Wheels\nAlmost every single social media course has content templates that you can follow. Use these as training wheels.\nHere\u2019s a template that I reuse on a daily basis. It\u2019s second nature for me now to structure my writing in a digestible, shareable, and understandable way:\nTrust me when I say:\n\n\u2013 Writing down your goals\n\u2013 Refining them into small tasks\n\u2013 Prioritizing each task daily\n\nWill make it 100x easier to actually achieve your goals\n\nRelying on your memory isn't reliable, distractions are all around you\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 29, 2020\nWhen you are studying high performing content, pay close attention to how it\u2019s structured.\nHook > value > conclusion.\nPractice plugging your ideas into these.\n3) Short Form Growth & Idea Validation\nTweets, reels, TikToks, shorts, Instagram posts, and LinkedIn posts are all styles of short-form content.\nSocial media platforms should be treated as \u201ctop of funnel\u201d growth mechanisms at the beginning. You can always start testing authority and authenticity style content, but you have to grow.\nIf you can master short form, you will have a solid base when it\u2019s time to evolve into stages 2 and 3.\nWhat happens if you get trapped in this stage?\nYou end up as a brand with high followers but zero loyalty.\nIf you were to disappear one day, nobody would ask themselves \u201cHey, where\u2019d Dan go?\u201d\nTheir obsession with engagement and basic advice leads to an account with low monetization potential.\nFull control over your income, lifestyle, and opportunities you take is not an option.\nThey act out of scarcity because they haven\u2019t mastered their survival through self-development.\nStage 2 Creators (Medium Leverage)\nOnce you hit 10K followers or so, you should feel like you have the whole social media growth game down.\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until this point to monetize, and I actually recommend not to wait, but this is where the real money will come in.\nAt 500 followers, I had a $3k month\n\nAt 10,000 followers, I had a $10k month\n\nAt 50,000 followers, I had a $50k month\n\nAt 200,000 followers, I had a $150k month\n\nIf this shocks you, good.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, props.\n\nHopefully it some break out of their limiting money beliefs.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 27, 2022\nIf you aren\u2019t making $1 per 1 follower, you can upskill yourself to reach that baseline.\n1) Learn Direct Response\nDirect response marketing or copywriting has the purpose of persuading people to convert immediately. Sales and offer creation are also lumped into this \u2013 worth studying.\nThis skill is what makes people like Alex Hormozi rich before they go all in on brand by giving everything away for free. You should give everything away for free, but over the course of years via long form content. Aggregate the actionable points in the form of a system into a paid product.\nThis is the same story with someone like Justin Welsh and many others in the social media space. They start out with a service business, burn through direct response books like Ca$hvertising by Whitman, and even when they pivot into a more \u2018authentic\u2019 voice \u2013 the advertising principles still form their marketing and content.\nBy learning direct response, you understand buyer psychology on a deeper level, and will see a drastic improvement in your offers, conversions, and baseline income.\n2) Build A High Ticket Offer\nWhen you are between 10,000 to 80,000 followers, you don\u2019t have the time in the game to pull in big money without a high ticket offer.\n(I am saying this from the context of starting a creator business without any prior business experience).\nThis is where freelancing, consulting, or coaching comes into play based around your interests and skill set. I talk about creating a Minimum Viable Offer to iterate on here.\nAt this stage, you have ample traffic \u2013 and hopefully skill \u2013 to land 4+ clients at $2500-$5000 per month.\nAll of these numbers are estimates depending on your true skill level backed by real world experience, not the skill level you think you are at.\nFocus on getting results, refining your unique system, and preparing yourself to evolve into stage 3.\nBy the way, I have strategies and roadmaps for every single thing we are talking about here inside Modern Mastery. Readers can join for $5.\n3) Branch Into Long Form Content\nBy now, you\u2019ve grown enough to know what tweets, posts, or ideas do well.\nYou want to start dissecting these ideas and creating depth behind them.\nYou do this by turning your validated ideas into long-form podcasts, newsletters, or YouTube videos.\nThe depth you create behind these ideas is what will turn followers into die-hard fans. And, you will find new ways of approaching the ideas to start creating your mental monopoly.\nI would recommend starting with a newsletter.\nLong-form content doesn\u2019t disappear. You can stack up 20+ newsletters and repurpose them to other platforms later.\nWhat happens if you get trapped in this stage?\nYou build yourself into another 9-5.\nYou\u2019ve mastered your survival, but haven\u2019t leaned into your curiosity.\nYou have just enough clients to make a living, but not enough time to utilize the leverage you\u2019ve built.\nStage 3 Creators (High Leverage)\nMany don\u2019t reach this stage.\nWhy?\nBecause it\u2019s impossible without survival mastery, ego development, and multidisciplinary study.\nPeople get locked into the \u201cone thing\u201d mindset (which isn\u2019t bad at the beginning), build themselves into a high-ticket client cycle, and don\u2019t pursue complementary interests and skills.\n1) Productize, Build A Network, & Leverage Results\nBy now, you may have already created a product. If so, good work.\nBut, by now, you definitely should have results from your service.\nYou\u2019ve iterated on your system for getting results, have gotten better results, and can now leverage those results everywhere.\nMy advice:\nTake your system and method for getting results\nReposition it towards a broader audience (beginner level)\nUse your results as initial social proof to have a 6 figure launch\nIf you want to know more about productizing your knowledge, I wrote about it here.\nThe social proof you\u2019ve acquired by having a high follower count and good ideas can get you in the door with other big players.\nDM them. Offer to help them however you can. Eventually, you will have 5-10 confidants that you can rely on for cross-platform growth and business opportunities.\n2) Refine Your Ideas & Diversify\nThe graphic above that illustrated my distribution network had 3 key areas: growth, authenticity, and authority.\nGrowth comes from short-form content.\nAuthority comes from product or service results.\nAuthenticity comes from long-form big idea synthesis.\nAnd, of course, they all overlap each other. Authority and authenticity can apply to short-form content, etc, etc.\nIn stage one, 80%+ of your content should be focused on growth.\nIn stage two, you start to incorporate more authority content around the product or service you are selling. You start to dabble in authenticity with long form.\nIn stage 3, it\u2019s time to double down on your best ideas and use them to grow on other platforms.\nI grew very quickly on Instagram and LinkedIn by:\nReaching out to big accounts on those platforms\nShowing them I had value (with my following) and time in the game\nOffering an exchange of services, shares, or money to help me grow in the most optimal way possible\nI had content that had already performed well.\nSo, when I approached a new platform with a solidified growth strategy\u2026 all I had to do was use my past content, get it in front of my network\u2019s network, and grow fast.\n3) Prioritize Long Form Content\nOnce you reach a point of high income and high followers, it\u2019s time to put a heavy emphasis on being a synthesizer.\nYou can do this at the start, of course, but this is where it becomes very important for the future of your brand.\nThis is best done with long form.\nIn short, you:\nPursue what interests you\nStudy the big-picture ideas of those interests\nNote patterns based on your experience\nConnect the dots with long-form content\nCreate your own versions of concepts, processes, and philosophies\nTake pieces of that long form for your short-form content\nThis is where business becomes extremely fulfilling.\nThis is how I created my own concept of the \u201cone-person business\u201d that gives a novel approach to all of this stuff. Others talk about one-person business all the time, but it\u2019s through the same watered-down lens that isn\u2019t very interesting.\nI\u2019ve also named processes like Intelligent Imitation, The Unknown, and Tactical Stress.\nThis comes from applying any of my interests \u2013 like philosophy, neurobiology, and spirituality \u2013 to business. I have enough exposure to all of those domains that I can note common patterns.\nTo Wrap Things Up\nAs to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. \u2013 Harrington Emerson\nThis entire letter is my method based on principles.\nDon\u2019t take it as law.\nThis is not the only way of doing business, clearly.\nTry things out, experiment, and create your own way of doing things.\nThe main lesson of this letter should be what I always preach.\nNever stop learning.\nNever stop building.\nNever stop evolving.\nDistraction and comfort are the only things that can get in your way.\nSelf-actualize > self-monetize > self-transcend.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nDigital Economics is now open to the public.

The character that plays a game will determine if that character wins.\nAnother word for the self is the \u201cego.\u201d\nThe \u201cI\u201d or \u201cme\u201d that when used in a sentence, always comes before a comparison.\nIt\u2019s not something you get rid of, it\u2019s something you develop.\nIf you want to ease your suffering, you must learn how to control your attention, which is heavily influenced by the ego.\nWhen you become self-conscious through attention and compare an aspect of yourself to something else, you tend to highlight the differences.\nThis makes you use precious mental energy and tends to scatter your thoughts.\nLike when you see a pimple on your skin in the mirror, then the idea of clear skin pops into your awareness, you begin the decline into a negative state of mind. You are comparing multiple ideas of what you think it should be, instead of accepting things as they are and moving on.\nOr, when you bring attention to your status in the world, the idea of societal success pops into your head, and you feel like you are \u201cbehind,\u201d when \u201cbehind\u201d is just a belief you hold in your mind.\nSo, how do we gain control of our attention?\nBy treating life as a game.\nMy generation is notorious for transferring their obsession with video games into business success.\nGames, business, and other constructions of the external world, or matrix:\nPresent a desirable hierarchy of goals\nHave a structure that frames your attention\nIntroduce a challenge to narrow your attention further\nRequire a player to have the skill that meets the requirements to play\nWhat few understand is that you can create a game out of any situation in life.\nIf you can mold your mind to create a fun game, life becomes enjoyable.\nIf you can\u2019t, your mind will be molded into playing societal status games. Like going to college, getting a high-paying job, or taking another structured approach to life that eases the initial suffering that sovereign living would imply.\nThe purpose of this letter is for awareness.\nI don\u2019t want you to wake up 20 years from now, with more responsibilities, just to realize that you will have to work twice as hard to get your life in order.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nMacro & Micro Games\nWhen playing an open-world strategy game, like World Of Warcraft, there are a few patterns to note in how it relates to everyday life.\nThere are the obvious things like:\nStacking gold\nChoosing a profession\nLeveling up your character\nAnd the progression that goes along with those things.\nBut, there are a few things that people tend to glance over, and they may help you see life from a new perspective.\nThe Game Is Programmed & Downloaded On The Hard Drive\nThe system is rigged.\n\nYou can't change it.\n\nBut you can learn it.\n\nThat is how you rig yourself in the system's favor.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) July 5, 2022\nThe conventional path to success has been programmed into the collective psyche.\nBefore we know it, we are already in pursuit of winning the game that society wants us to pursue, usually in favor of maintaining the game.\nGo to college\nGet a high-paying job\nRetire at 65 so you can finally enjoy life\n90% of the time, it doesn\u2019t work out that way.\n(And usually ends up in a perpetual state of anxiety, despair, and lack of fulfillment).\nWhy? Because times are changing and the programmers can\u2019t patch the game fast enough. As that would require them to overhaul the school, banking, and employment systems.\nRemoving one foundational piece of a skyscraper may cause it to fall.\nThis is why individuals are filling these roles (and making a hefty income doing so) by educating people online as a creator, programming decentralized currency, and offering their services as independent contract workers (like freelancing.)\nThe people that never question this system and instead succumb to their programming, are known as NPCs.\nNon-Player Characters.\nThese include townsfolk, bosses in a battle quest, and others that keep the game interesting for the players. They do what they are told to do.\nThen, there are the people that choose to play the game with a conscious mind and have fun playing the game that the collective ego has created.\nThere Are Infinite Paths You Can Take\nIn World Of Warcraft, you have a series of choices that you get to make:\nWhat your character looks like\nWhat kind of player they are (warrior, mage, etc)\nWhat profession they want to learn\nThe quest path they want to take to level up\nWhether they play solo or with a group\nWhat guild they join to help them level faster\nAnd a series of other personal choices that allow the game to be played how you like.\nYou see, life is like a mountain, but this mountain is infinitely tall.\nIf 5 people were standing at the bottom, and you asked them to create a path to the first peak, all of them would draw a slightly different route.\nThen, when they reach that peak, not only are they able to look down and help others climb faster, but there is another peak to reach, but from a place of prior experience.\nIncreasing Your Level Increases The Complexity Of The Self\nIn the real world, the main spiritual problem is that people never change.\nThey identify with beliefs, their job, and the life path that was impressed on them.\nTheir ego never changes, because it doesn\u2019t want to.\nOnce they\u2019ve reached that point in life, they cease to learn, stack skills, and \u201clevel up\u201d to the point of more opportunities being available to them.\nBy improving your skill set, you are able to take on more complex challenges in life.\nBy taking on more challenges, you acquire the knowledge and experience that expands your awareness.\nLike putting points into specific traits in your skill tree in a video game.\nEventually, you have so much power and experience that the entire world is yours to roam freely, without stress or obligation.\nBy taking on higher-level challenges, what used to be an unknown area on the map is now explored \u2014 and can continue to be explored as much as you\u2019d like.\nAs you develop yourself, you have the knowledge and experience necessary to create order from chaos.\nYou have more power to create enjoyment out of any situation.\nThis overall structure represents the game of life, the macro game.\nBut, it goes deeper.\nEvery single situation you find yourself in can be considered a micro game.\nA game within a game.\nLet\u2019s discuss how you can create maximum enjoyment while playing the game of life.\nSet A Hierarchy Of Goals\nGames present the big goal of winning.\nThey also present sub-goals, like quests, that guide you toward winning the game.\nIf there was only the goal of winning, and you had little clarity on how to win, the game wouldn\u2019t be fun. And your mind will not be able to maintain order, meaning it will decline into chaos.\nBy now it should be common knowledge that creating a vision for your future is a good thing to do.\nAs humans, we have the ability to aim.\nMonkeys can throw their poop, but they don\u2019t plan ahead. The poop usually gets hurled straight toward the ground.\nHumans on the other hand can bring their attention to a target, and depending on their skill level, hit a bullseye from 50 yards out.\nWe don\u2019t want to be poop hurled at the ground, so we create a vision that we can build towards.\nBut, if we don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed by our grand vision, we need a plan. A set of goals, from the top down that brings clarity to our daily actions, making them that much easier to act on.\nThink big, act small.\nSit down with a pen and paper, or use my Power Planner, to:\nCreate the first iteration of your vision\nCreate a 10 year, 1 year, and monthly goals\nHave a place for weekly direction and reflection\nAlign your daily priority tasks with those\nWith these written down, you will expand your awareness to notice opportunity that fuels that vision.\nAnd as better ideas come to mind, you can refine them further to order your mind.\nThe Frame Of The Game\nYour perspective is the frame from which you perceive reality.\nLike a camera.\nThe field of view, even if the background is blurred, constrains what registers in the frame itself.\nBy manipulating your perspective in any situation, you can perceive what used to be problematic as a minor road bump.\nIn a video game, there are two things that order consciousness in a way that reduces anxiety, overwhelm, and stress.\n1) Rules\nEvery video game has a set of rules that have to be followed in order to win the game without cheating.\nWhen we play the game, this allows us to use our limited conscious attention to remain focused on the here and now \u2013 while holding the end goal in the back of our mind.\nIn psychology, dopamine spurts into your brain at the thought of possessing something desirable in the future (i.e. winning the game or your vision).\nThe \u201chere and now\u201d chemicals \u2013 like serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins \u2013 reward your brain when you appreciate what\u2019s in front of you (i.e. playing the game or executing priority tasks).\nSo, it only makes sense that when you play the game with the intention of winning, you are much more likely to kick into the enjoyable state of flow.\nFlow, by scientific measures, is just a cocktail of reward chemicals flooding your brain that are manipulated through focused attention.\nBut, only if you meet other requirements that we will discuss soon.\nIn the real world, and on the macro scale of life, your \u201crules\u201d are your values.\nThe things that you deem as important.\nWhen you act in alignment with your values, while constraining those actions to be conducive to your life\u2019s purpose, maximum enjoyment ensues.\nOn the micro scale of everyday situations, clarity comes from eliminating environmental distractions.\nLike when you are trying to do deep work.\nYou close browser tabs, put on noise-canceling headphones, and have clear steps for your work.\nWhen that work is aligned with an intrinsic outcome, you can guess what happens next. Flow.\nNow, this doesn\u2019t only come down to understanding and eliminating environmental distractions.\nYou can create rules or boundaries in a what-used-to-be mundane situation.\nI used to hate going on a long walk, even when I knew they were beneficial to my mental and physical health.\nSo, what you can do is:\nSet a goal for that situation, like 2,500 steps\nCreate rules to gamify it, like never stepping on a crack\nTake the action of least resistance, like stepping out your front door\nGoal, clarity, simplified action.\nThis also works in situations that you would normally hate being in.\nLike if you don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d why people watch sports or go bird watching.\nCreate your own game out of it.\n2) Mechanics\nIf you haven\u2019t played the game before, it is going to be difficult.\nYour aim will suck.\nYou will have to practice on low-level challenges.\nYou will be awestruck by the artfulness of top-level players.\nEvery game has a specific way for you to incorporate more of your senses, thoughts, and prior experience that is channeled through attention.\nIn a video game, it\u2019s pressing a series of keys, buttons, or mouse clicks.\nIn board games, it\u2019s the effectiveness, creativity, or forward thinking that goes into your strategy.\nIn sports, it\u2019s the conditioning of your body and how you move it in accordance with the goal.\nIn all of the above, it\u2019s your perception of the situation (the frame of the game) and how you choose to act to win.\nFeedback is important here.\nA game needs a way to maintain order as the game is being played.\nWhen you know how well you are doing, you are less likely to break focus.\nIf your perspective is limited and you can\u2019t perceive a situation in a way that gives you clarity, it will be difficult to make a \u201cgood\u201d move and eventually win.\nWhen this happens, your mind will widen its perspective \u2013 or framed attention \u2013 which opens up room for distraction.\nHow do we improve our mechanics while playing a game?\nPractice, of course.\nIn a game, you usually log in every single day to perform a repetitive process of tasks. Like grinding quests, farming XP, or crafting weapons to increase the level in your profession.\nYou have to program that specific mechanic in your brain to make it effortless.\nIn other words, habit formation.\nIf you can automate the decisions you make, success becomes effortless.\nThis takes time and a perpetual thirst for learning.\nWe will discuss this more soon.\nThe Delicate Balance Of Anxiety & Boredom\nWhen you start playing a game, especially without reading the rule book, will the experience be enjoyable?\nProbably not.\nAnd even if you knew the rules, it wouldn\u2019t be that enjoyable until you started to grasp the mechanics of the game.\nIf you were a level 1 in World Of Warcraft, and somehow were able to fight a level 50 character, would it be fun?\nOne, you\u2019d lose immediately.\nTwo, no, it just wouldn\u2019t be fun unless you created a better frame of the game in your mind \u2013 like trying to lose because you want to see how powerful a level 50 is.\nIf you had played chess a few times with your buddies, would you even consider entering a competitive competition? Or playing against a Grand Master?\nThe lesson:\nIf your skill doesn\u2019t match the challenge that the game presents, you\u2019re in for a bad time.\nIf your skill is high and the challenge low, you will get bored.\nIf your skill is low and the challenge is high, you will get anxious.\nThe boredom stems from self-centeredness. Your focus breaks, a new desire pops into your head, and related thoughts start filling your attention.\nIf you are bored at work, you will start thinking of more productive things you could be doing.\nThe anxiety stems from self-consciousness. Your focus turns toward your concept of self, and again, related thoughts start penetrating your field of awareness.\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m not as good as I thought.\u201d\n\u201cI really need to work on my backswing.\u201d\n\u201cThat girl is way out of my league.\u201d\nNotice the use of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d that implies a comparison.\nThis comparison leads to psychic entropy: the mind tending toward disorder unless maintained with proper energy, or ordered information that can be processed by the conscious mind as energy.\nHow do we prevent this?\nThrough lifelong learning.\nAnd if you\u2019ve been on this letter for a bit, you know what that means:\nLifelong building.\nPerceiving your life as not only a game, in this perspective, but as a project.\nHolding the intention of improvement in your mind, encountering a problem that sparks anxiety or boredom, and learning in the form of specific knowledge to overcome that problem.\nDon\u2019t Hate The Player, Create The Player\nAt this point in our history it should be possible for an individual to build a self that is not simply the outcome of biological drives and cultural habits, but a conscious, personal creation. \u2013 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nI remember the first time I downloaded World Of Warcraft as a teenager.\nI spent a solid 2 hours studying the minor details of each race, class, and options to change how I physically looked, while holding the thought of winning in my head to make proper decisions.\nWas I going to be a warrior? Shaman? Or something in between?\nDid I want to be a troll?\nMaybe just a human with long hair?\nWhen I went to take on the challenge of certain quests and dungeons, did my personality work best as a tank, support, or damage character?\nHow about when I hit level 15?\nWhat professions would I want to pursue?\nThere were so many like alchemy, mining, blacksmithing, and more that would determine how much I could exploit the public trade system.\nOnce I made my choice, I then had a series of \u201ctalents\u201d and \u201ctraits\u201d that I was able to level up with experience.\nAnd once I had leveled them to a certain point, I was given more choices that weren\u2019t originally available to me.\nEnough with the reminiscing, how does this apply to everyday life?\nFirst, to paint a picture, I do not think humans are good by nature.\nLike Eve eating the apple from the tree of knowledge, we have the endless desire to know more.\nLearning is the foundation of the human experience.\nWhen we are young, we don\u2019t know any better and end up with a \u201cself\u201d that has been programmed into our minds. Learned from our environment.\nLearning, through any medium, influences our thoughts. Especially if what we are learning is repeated, or conditioned, into our heads.\nOur thoughts influence behavior.\nMeaning, anything that you learn or consume shapes who you are and how you act in this world.\nWinning the game of life, business, or any present-moment situation you are in is dependent on how your character frames, perceives, and acts within that game.\nSuccess is a subjective goal that we hold in our minds.\nA goal is achieved through the right sequence of actions.\nSo, if we want to achieve the life of our dreams, we have to create a character that can play the game of life well.\nHow do we create our character?\n1) By integrating everything we\u2019ve discussed in this letter.\nYou need an intrinsic hierarchy of goals to order your mind at any given moment.\nWhen you get lost, bring your attention to your vision, goals, and priorities to gain clarity.\n2) Through self-education and self-reflection.\nYour hierarchy of goals presents a series of challenges that you will have to take on through skill acquisition, problem-solving, and direct experience.\nThese are all forms of learning.\nThankfully, we live in an age where any and all information is at the edge of your fingertips. The solutions to your problems are found in the form of ideas that you must implement.\nYou find these ideas by consistently consuming valuable information. Sometimes you have to sift through dirt to find gold. This is a lifelong process that can only be derailed by distraction and cheap pleasures.\nSelf-reflection is how you guide future decision-making.\nHow?\nBecause it is impossible to have 100% certainty in the actions you take.\nYou just have to take them.\nAnd when you do, the only way you can determine whether those actions were good or bad is through self-reflection.\nIf your current life is the product of your past decisions, that means you can\u2019t know the \u201ceffect\u201d of a \u201ccause\u201d until it happens.\nEven if you \u201cknow\u201d what will happen because someone told you, you aren\u2019t taking into account every other environmental factor that could lead to different results. Without direct experience, you limit your potential.\nWhen you sit and contemplate your decisions, that is how you find the \u201ceffect.\u201d\nFrom that, and with time, your decisions get more and more accurate to the point of you reaching your goals.\nLet\u2019s do a quick recap:\nGames are a way of ordering consciousness to the point of obsession.\nWhen you are obsessed, you stop caring what people think and play to win according to your values.\nGames are enjoyable, and every situation in life can be mentally molded into a game.\nIf you want to avoid mental turmoil, your skill needs to match the challenge that any situation presents.\nYour perspective will determine the information available to you, and if it\u2019s not structured, you will misperceive it.\nYour self, a concept, is the player. With time, you want to create the character that can win the games that it is best at.\nI hope you all enjoyed reading this.

        "content": "Attention isn\u2019t the new currency.\nInformation is.\nInformation is what we process with attention.\nThat\u2019s all humans really do\u2026\nWe process, store, and use information to create or destroy.\nI\u2019d like to believe that the unconscious, evolution-aligned intent behind modern technology, like social media, was to allow us as humans to gain access to information we wouldn\u2019t normally have. Thus increasing our potential in life.\nInformation leads to awareness of opportunity.\nAwareness of opportunity leads to profitable ideas.\nProfitable ideas lead to positive behavior change.\nManipulation of information can lead to death, destruction, and getting stuck in your own head\u2026 but we\u2019ve talked about that before.\nInstead, I want to discuss the positive aspects of the information age we live in (and how you can take advantage of it).\nI want you to understand one thing:\nEverything is information.\nOur genetic code is information. Light is information that our eyes interpret in a way that aligns with our survival. Our programming is the result of information repeated over time.\nInformation is how humans form beliefs, which shape our thoughts, and go on to influence behavior.\nInformation is what culminates as tension \u2014 or resistance \u2014 that when relieved, leads to discovery, innovation, and creative breakthrough. New ideas that can impact the future of the cosmos.\nInformation is what allows us to survive and thrive, as it comes before anything else that uses information as its foundation.\nEveryone has the same big goal they are trying to achieve:\nIncrease the quality of their human experience as much as possible.\nOur thoughts, emotions, and actions \u2014 which are all forms of information \u2014 dictate our experience, which is information in the form of feedback.\nYou see, the human mind needs ordered information to keep itself, well\u2026 ordered. Like sports, religious doctrine, or routines. Once we have the information to play a game well, through learning, and then play the game that results in experience, that experience will be higher quality than if we were fed scattered information.\nThere is content and there is consciousness.\nThe structure of the content is what determines happiness and fulfillment. That content can represent order or chaos, the latter resulting in a poor quality of experience.\nWhile most use information as a way to distract themselves from the problems in their life (through argument, mainstream news, and flavor-of-the-day drama), others realize it is a trap and let curiosity guide them in the opposite direction.\nThen, there are those I genuinely feel bad for\u2026 the ones that are trapped consuming negative content about how courses and other information products are bad to sell. If that\u2019s you, gain some perspective. You live in the information age. Don\u2019t write off an entire epoch of existence because you had one bad experience with a sleazy marketer.\nIf you fall into the curious group, this letter is for you. Why?\nBecause you have $100,000+ worth of information in your head.\nIn this letter, I want to propose a system for packaging up that knowledge to distribute to others in a valuable way.\nA way to use information for good while opening the potential to profit handsomely.\nControlling the content (information) of your consciousness and guiding the content (through content) of others\u2019 consciousness. Both (preferably) resulting in a high-quality experience.\nA journey of both self-actualization and self-monetization that eventually results in self-transcendence.\nIncreasing your quality of life, then others.\nNotice how this information (the content you are reading right now) can lead to potential opportunities. Don\u2019t manipulate what I\u2019m saying with your mind just yet. Be open. Hold the idea in the realm of possibility for the rest of this letter.\nHow I Turned My Knowledge Into A 7 Figure Business As A Value Creator\nIt\u2019s been a bit since I\u2019ve discussed my story, and we have quite a few new people reading since then, so here are the cliff notes (I\u2019ll rewrite my story at some point for an entire letter):\nI tried and failed at most marketable skills and online business models\nI lost $8,000 trying to make them work and had to get a web design job for the sake of survival\nMy knowledge and skills compounded to the point where I made freelance web design work\nI started writing on Twitter and pivoted my freelance offer for the following I was attracting\nI started on Twitter 3 years ago.\nIn my first year, I launched 3 information products and pulled in my first 6 figures of info product sales.\nFirst was a \u201chow to freelance with web design\u201d product.\nThe second was a product that taught how I built the websites.\nThe third was how I grew on Twitter and used it as my sole way of landing freelance clients.\nEventually, I bundled all of these up and sold them at a discount (now they are a bonus for joining Modern Mastery).\nIn my second year, I started branching out to new platforms like Instagram and podcasting.\nDuring this time, I tried launching 3 other products that failed miserably by my own doing and lack of promotion. A physical planner, a self-help eBook, and a course on offer creation (also all bonuses for Modern Mastery).\nI also tried selling multiple high-ticket offers. I saw success with marketing consulting for creators and ghostwriting, but was quick to get out of ghostwriting as it was a massive time suck (meaning it went against my values and didn\u2019t align with my goals of maximum time freedom).\nThis is when I launched Modern Mastery.\nI launched the community with the information I had already put out.\nNow, finally, in my third year, I feel as if I have the product and service stack that will carry me through a solid 10 years of hyper profitability.\nWhat\u2019s the lesson here (before we dive deep into how you can do the same)?\n1) I have the experience to talk about this. I\u2019ve sold 6 figures each of info products, coaching, consulting, freelancing, and agency work.\n2) Constant building and iteration.\nNONE of what I built went to waste. It gave me something to build on top of and refine my ideas further.\nThis is where most creators go wrong.\nThey wait to launch something because of a deep-rooted fear.\nThey know the first product is going to suck, because it\u2019s inevitable, so they prevent themselves from iterating early \u2014 which opens them up to a higher income ceiling faster.\nBuild.\nNOW.\nHow To Extract The Value Stuck In Your Brain\nBrand is what you do.\n\nProduct is how you do it.\n\nMarketing is why you do it.\n\nDo something that improves your quality of life, teach others how you did it, and show them why they should care.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 15, 2022\nIn previous letters, we discussed an overview of productizing yourself and becoming a value creator. Treat this letter as part 3 in the one-person business series (with many more to come).\nIn this letter, I want to discuss how to ideate the perfect product while doing what you enjoy in this life.\nIf your personal brand revolves around what you do, your product revolves around your unique way of doing it.\nWhat you do = what you do on a daily basis in pursuit of your goal for a better life.\nHow you do it = the system, method, or process that you\u2019ve created to get better results. This comes from experience and experimentation.\nI sold a freelancing product because I had made 6 figures with freelancing. I knew how to do it well and had processes in place for landing clients, delivering the service, and making it sustainable.\nI built a membership community based on what I do on a daily basis. Like having a reminder and accountability for completing your daily \u2018priority tasks\u2019 during focused work.\nI now sell a writing product because I had built my entire 500K+ audience with a 2-hour-a-day writing (and walking) habit.\nOthers sell minimalist training programs that go completely against the accepted \u2018good\u2019 advice for lifting weights. If someone only has 2 hours a week to train, because they work long hours, but they still made progress\u2026 that is unique, and your marketing is already laid out for you. They sell a system to those with limited time because they\u2019ve experimented to the point of getting results.\nIn summary, everyone that has productized themselves has done 3 things:\nThey improved their quality of life through personal and professional development\nThey learned necessary skills and interests along the way to increase their quality of life\nThey started posting online regardless of \u2018how basic\u2019 they thought their information was\nI want to pose this question to you:\nIs there any better business model you can think of?\nTo self-actualize, self-monetize, and use business as a modality for self-transcendence?\nTo increase the quality of your human experience (what everyone is trying to do) and pass down what you learned along the way?\nThere are other viable business models of course, but I genuinely believe this is the way of the future.\nIf we lived in accordance with our nature, there would be one business for every one person on this planet. All unique. All fulfilling the perfect purpose.\nThis will never happen of course, but that just means it will never get saturated (if, and only if, people take their piece of the pie and leave it at that. Know when enough is enough).\nHere are 3 questions you can contemplate this week to brainstorm a profitable product idea:\n1) What is the highlight of your day?\nIs it writing? Journaling? Meditating? Yoga? The gym?\nThis is the most difficult part because it slips under most people\u2019s nose.\nThese are the things that seem so \u201cnormal\u201d to us that we think others wouldn\u2019t benefit from our perspective.\nIf you journal, can you create a journal for yourself and sell it down the road?\nCan you create your own yoga routine?\nHow about a writing system?\nWhat is the thing you enjoy doing, to the point of it being effortless, that benefits your life so much to the point of you wanting to teach others?\n2) What do you do better than your peers?\nIf your friend expressed genuine interest in what you do, what is that one thing that you could teach them everything about?\nAnother metric:\nWhat is something that your friends will criticize you for because they don\u2019t understand it?\nLike how Chris Bumstead, a champion and competitor in Mr. Olympia, said how he had to give up a \u201cnormal\u201d life to achieve greatness. He would skip partying and eating out to recover and cook healthy meals. His friends didn\u2019t get it, but he sure as hell knew that it led toward something they couldn\u2019t fathom.\n3) Who do you follow and what do they sell?\nSuccess is counterintuitive, and this is the best advice I can give related to ideating a great product:\nSell what is already selling.\nPlease for the love of all things holy do not take this advice lightly. Those 5 words single-handedly created the foundation of my business.\nThis requires you to immerse yourself in the digital environment you want to join, like success by osmosis (or \u201cyour network is your networth\u201d).\nPay very close attention to those you aspire to be like.\nReverse engineer their profile, content, landing pages, products, and anything else so you can piece together the puzzle of their success (and then replicate it).\n4) A Bonus For Those That Haven\u2019t Started\nIf you haven\u2019t started, you need to be decisive.\nPick a path that slightly interests you and start acting today.\nLook at the books on your shelf, the videos in your browser history that you watch to learn (not distract yourself), and who you follow on social media that inspires you to be better.\nSet a goal, learn from those who have achieved it, and replicate their success.\nCreating A Profitable Product (In The Simplest Way I Can Explain It)\nBefore we start, I want to reiterate the context of this entire letter.\nWe are discussing this from the perspective of productizing yourself via information. We will not be discussing physical products, freelance services, or even B2B (business-to-business) sales.\nThis is the You2You business model, or if it helps you frame it in a less selfish way; the Creator2Creator model. Your brand, product, content, and every other facet of your business comes from organizing the information in your head, solidified through experience, into a creation that others perceive as valuable.\nYou build for yourself and attract those that resonate with what you\u2019re building.\nOne key point that most miss:\nThis has to be done in public.\nYou need data to know whether your information is valuable or not.\nStarving artists love to create what they think is valuable, and when others don\u2019t validate their ideas, they blame everyone but themselves for their inability to pivot, iterate, and create something that actually serves the collective good.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nUse these 7 (non-linear) steps to turn your self-improvement journey into a self-monetization journey:\n1) Become Above Average In Select Skills Or Interests\nMotivation gets you into this game. Learning is what helps you continue to play. Creativity is how you steer. Flow is how you turbo boost the results beyond all rational standards and reasonable expectations. \u2014 Steven Kotler\nWe\u2019ve discussed skills and interests multiple times before, so I\u2019m assuming many of you have already begun learning the ones that interest you.\nHere\u2019s something that most people don\u2019t want to hear:\nIf you aren\u2019t seeing the results you want, in any endeavor, it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t skilled enough. You haven\u2019t put in the necessary time to learn how to play, win, and become artful in the game.\nWithout this focus on learning, we tend to focus on the desired outcome that we don\u2019t have. We begin to compare ourselves to the results of others that have a higher skill level (that isn\u2019t visible to the unskilled eye).\nI had a comment on one of my posts the other day.\nSomeone asked why he wasn\u2019t growing on social media even after following common advice on how to grow.\nIt\u2019s still a skill problem.\nThere is only so much about a skill you can learn from learning alone. You have to marinate your skillset in the market. This expands your awareness around the skill. You pick up little nuances if you don\u2019t mindlessly repeat what you\u2019ve been told to do.\nYou can comment, engage with big accounts, or follow any of the other fundamental social media growth advice out there \u2014 but if you aren\u2019t seeing results, you have to identify what\u2019s causing that blockage.\nIs it your messaging? Are you fluent in English? Do you add a space before punctuation ? Is there a crucial piece of what you learned that you didn\u2019t think was important?\nIn most cases, you can\u2019t go wrong learning how to write, how to market, and how to sell.\nBusiness is transactional in nature.\nWriting, marketing, and sales will teach you human psychology, but in a practical way that spills over into all transactional areas of your life.\n2) Build Something With Those Skills Every Day\nDon\u2019t learn if you don\u2019t have something to build.\nBut don\u2019t let this trick you into thinking that your entire life isn\u2019t something you are building.\nMeaning, be ruthless with eliminating distractions. Information that stems from distractions leads to disorder of the mind, and as we\u2019ve discussed, that leads to overwhelm, anxiety, and lack of clarity \u2014 the opposite of building.\nIf you are learning marketing, build a brand.\nIf you are learning spirituality, build a life.\nIf you are learning any of the infinite skills that stem from either of those, apply what you learn to your life, business, or both. Hold that intention in your mind.\n3) Document Your Learnings, Discoveries, & Results\nTake notes.\nWrite content.\nTreat the internet as a way of documenting the information that makes sense, sparks excitement, and is valuable to you. Document your ordered consciousness so that others can benefit.\nThe internet is a public note-taking software, public journal, and public school that shortcuts your way to massive opportunity, but only if you treat it as such.\nWe discussed last week how \u201cstart, build, teach\u201d is the best way to retain what you learn.\n4) Experiment For Holistic Understanding\nI\u2019ve always loved doing things \u201cmy own way.\u201d\nMy own way = implementing the best teachings from multiple sources until I have a unique way of doing it.\nWith fitness, I\u2019ve tried every training style under the sun. I enjoyed minimalist, high-intensity, full-body training 3 days a week the most.\nWith diet, I\u2019ve tried vegan, ancestral, carnivore, IIFYM, keto, and calorie restriction models like intermittent fasting.\nFrom that experimentation, I can navigate the health space artfully. I can take the most enjoyable aspects from each of those diets and create something new that I genuinely enjoy (that gets me results).\nIf I wanted to slap a name on my diet or training program and sell it, I could. And with my marketing knowledge, I would do a damn good job at it. But I\u2019ll leave that space less saturated for now \ud83d\ude09\nThis is the way of the synthesizer.\nSince most niches have been filled in multiple industries, this is the way of the future, as it allows for infinite creativity and lack of saturation.\nSimilar to how Electronic Dance Music came about from technological advancements. New genres and subgenres are being created every week. The electronic industry continues to grow because the technology allows DJs and producers to infinitely innovate.\nCreators are just IJs.\nIdea Junkies.\nIdeas are the sounds, content are the songs.\nCreate your mix, play it loud, and attract an audience.\n5) Iterate On Your Process For Efficiency & Results\nOnce you have a holistic understanding of the skill or interest you want to pursue, create your own process.\nLiterally, write down your own SOPs.\nSOP = Standard Operating Procedure in business.\nLike an SOP I had for creating client websites as a web designer that turned into a web design course (of course, I had to add a bit more detail to the curriculum, but that\u2019s the easy part).\nIt is a set of steps, with a description, on how to perform a certain task that gets a result. A system.\nWhen you follow this system and gain direct experience from using it, you will encounter problems. Especially the first few times around.\nWhen you encounter this problem, make a small change to your system.\nTest again, see if it works, and repeat the process until you have something that consistently gets results.\nAnother example of this would be my Power Planner.\nI created a productivity system for myself.\nI would write down certain things every day to ensure I was completing my priority tasks. I experimented with multiple planners and took what I liked most from them.\nEventually, I packaged it up, sent the designs to a printer, and created a physical planner (that I stopped selling because I hated handling inventory from my small apartment).\nMy course, The 2 Hour Writer, started off as templates that I created for writing my newsletters based on what I had learned about writing, persuasion, social media growth, and marketing.\nThat one took a bit more testing and experience, but the point still stands.\nI show my process for creating a system in Notion and turning it into a product inside MMHQ.\n6) Steal Marketing & Structure That Already Works\n\u201cSell what\u2019s already selling.\u201d\nThis is the single best piece of counterintuitive advice I\u2019ve received.\nI created The 2 Hour Writer because I knew how hot the writing market was in my little Twitter circle.\nI knew that people were selling 7+ figures a year in writing products on Twitter alone.\nI knew that I had a unique take on writing, even when I don\u2019t consider myself a writer, and had the results to back it.\nTo make it even easier on myself, I was able to take the best aspects of certain writers\u2019 landing pages.\nThe headlines\nThe burning problems\nThe offer and curriculum structure\nThe guarantee, benefits, FAQs, and the rest\nThe positioning (not \u201cmake money online with writing\u201d)\nThis is no different from any other product I\u2019ve created.\nMy first product, an ebook on how web developers can start freelancing, was created because:\nI knew the developer market was hot, they love buying courses (I was a developer)\nThey were on Twitter and actively following people\nMost dev courses were underpriced on Udemy (a course platform). I knew I had to differentiate myself with a personal brand on social media to charge more and pull in a sustainable income.\nI had purchased a similar freelancing course myself and gotten results with it\nSince I had results and my own way of doing things, I decided to create my own.\nI could use the seller\u2019s content, marketing, and ebook itself as inspiration for my own.\nI outlined my product, pulled inspiration from others to be sure I was covering everything, and wrote it with the knowledge in my head.\nBuyers buy again. Remember that.\nHow many courses, on the same topic, have you bought? And why do you believe that someone wouldn\u2019t buy yours if you created something similar?\nI personally don\u2019t affiliate for many products because I usually have the results, and don\u2019t want less than half of the earnings.\nIf I want something, I create it. If I want to sell a specific type of product, I create it.\n7) Build Distribution & Systemize Promotions\nThere are a lot of moving pieces in business.\nBrand is one of those things you don\u2019t have to change too much.\nProduct is similar, but you should maintain and update it when the time is right.\nContent and marketing, on the other hand, these are a consistent effort.\nContent is for building distribition.\nAn audience\nAn email list\nA community if you feel like it\nMarketing is for distributing your product through promotions.\nPlugging in your social posts\nPromoting in your newsletter\nChanging up the angle and messaging\nThe only way you will succeed in the great online game is with persistence and iteration.\nMake a bunch of noise and laser in on signal.\nThrow a bunch of tweets at the wall for a month.\n(Be sure you are working to get eyes on your content through networking, replies, or paid growth).\nNote which content does best and begin to say 1 thing 1000 different ways. Post it to other platforms, turn it into a newsletter topic, and turn that newsletter into a YouTube video.\nSame with marketing.\nPromote, see what gets the most clicks and conversions, double down, continue testing, and repeat.\nRemember, 10-year mindset, not 2-week mindset.\nYour content and promotions, after 1-3 years, will be so good that \u201chow-to\u201d advice will start to mean nothing to you.\nYou learn to harness the power of self-awareness and intuition.\nThe caveat:\nYou have to start writing, building, and promoting.\nIf you\u2019re anxious, remember that the unknown becomes known with time.\nYou\u2019ll have to lean into it at some point, might as well be now.\nAn autonomous, profitable, and fulfilling future awaits.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nDigital Economics is open for Enrollment until tomorrow night. If you missed enrollment a month ago, and want to join midway through, nows the time. The next cohort is in February.\nEnroll here.\nIn Modern Mastery, I posted a strategy for planning 3 years of unique content.

        "heading": "How I Remember Everything I Learn",
        "content": "If you\u2019re anything like me, you love studying deep concepts.\nBut, there\u2019s a dissonance.\nYou feel like you could never be as deep, insightful, or impactful as your favorite authors, speakers, or even the people you follow on social media.\nAs an 18 year old that got arrested for smoking pot in a college parking garage, I took a chance on reading The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle.\nI read closely.\nI practiced the meditations.\nI opened my mind to the possibility of the notion of God (that I had closed myself off to as a rebellious teen).\nThat book changed everything for me. It eased my worries about getting a potential felony charge. It helped me calm down and be less reactive toward those I don\u2019t agree with.\nI didn\u2019t remember everything from that book, but I learned 10x more than any other book I was told to read in school.\nWhy did I remember so much of that book?\n1) Having An Intention\nI am big on goal setting, whether you write it down or not.\nWhen I read the book, it was the perfect fit for my situation in life.\nI was at one of the lowest points in my life. I either had to go to court for smoking the devil\u2019s lettuce and possibly be convicted of a felony, or hand over $10,000 to take a diversion program and get called to randomly pee in a cup every week.\nAs a 19-year-old going into my second year of college, this freaked me out, clearly. I didn\u2019t have the money and there was no way in hell I was going to tell my parents.\nSo, when The Power Of Now was recommended to me, I had the intent to apply its teachings to the phase of life I was in.\nI was willing to do anything \u2013 and read with a radically open mind \u2013 to allow the teachings to transform my mental state.\n2) Genuine Curiosity\nI first heard about the book from Matt Ogus.\nFor those unaware of the golden era of fitness on YouTube, Matt Ogus is one of the original fitness vloggers.\nHe was someone I aspired to be like. One of my first digital mentors (and he doesn\u2019t even know it).\nHe had recommended the book many times in his videos, and I had a genuine curiosity to learn what this whole \u201cspirituality\u201d thing was about.\nI normally wouldn\u2019t have read the book, but I trusted Matt, like I\u2019m sure some of you trust me.\nCuriosity forced me to read slow, meticulous, and aim to understand what was being said \u2013 especially in the areas that were difficult to understand.\n3) Reducing The Execution Gap\nThe greatest skill one can develop is decreasing the time between idea and execution.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 5, 2022\nNow, when I read the book, if there was something to practice, I would put the book down immediately.\nI remember sitting outside on the porch with my coffee, trying to tap into all of my 5 senses, and doing multiple meditative practices.\nSince the ideas were fresh in my head, it was easier to notice when something as intangible as meditation was working.\nBecoming aware that it was working solidified the idea in my head.\nI had direct experience to back the idea.\nI took the words and grounded them in reality.\nHaving an intention, genuine curiosity, and reducing the execution gap is an incredible way to retain more of what you study \u2013 but we can do better than that.\nOver the years, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve discovered to 10X the power of whatever I choose to read, research, or study.\nWhat Are You Building?\nPraxis (noun) \u2014 practice, as distinguished from theory.\nThe modern problem is abundance of information.\nWe love to horde theory, orthodoxy, and conceptual understanding of things without direct experience. Because that means we have to do something we perceive as uncomfortable, when we\u2019ve been conditioned into perceived comfort.\nLife doesn\u2019t work that way, and nobody wants to be \u201cthat\u201d guy in the Instagram comments. You know, the one that gives a book\u2019s worth of lifting (or business) advice while looking like he\u2019s never been within a 10-foot radius of a barbell (or customer).\nWhat you\u2019ll find in most domains is that true experts rarely need guidance. They used science, theory, and advice to get to the intermediate stage, but learn that intuition and direct experience trump all once you get into the advanced stage.\nAside from posting, I don\u2019t log on to social media anymore. I don\u2019t mean to sound arrogant, but 99.99% of the advice doesn\u2019t apply to me. All it does is make me second guess myself in my mental, physical, financial, and spiritual training. My praxis, which is backed by my personal philosophy, that was forged through experience.\nSo, how do we balance practice with theory?\nBy becoming a builder.\nThat is, always having a project to build in alignment with the theory you are learning about.\nWhen I was learning Photoshop, I started by watching endless tutorials on how to use the software. This only led to getting stuck in tutorial hell.\nWhen it came time to create something, I knew nothing.\nI had to supplement what I was building with specific tutorials.\nOnce I realized how much I retained from this style of learning \u2014 having a project to apply my knowledge to \u2014 I switched to this method exclusively.\nIf I wanted to learn how to build a website, I wouldn\u2019t start learning first. I would pick a software to build the website on, then watch a long tutorial on how to build the website.\nI wouldn\u2019t follow the tutorial exactly, because I didn\u2019t want to create the same thing. I took what I was learning and struggled to create my own website. The struggle primed my brain to \u201clock in\u201d the lesson.\nNow, why does this method work for retaining information?\n1) Forced Synchronicity\nNovelty, pattern recognition, and the dopamine involved in both are crucial for learning.\nWhen our ancestors noticed something new, they would remember it, especially when it aligned with their survival.\nLike if they pass by a bare bush they had seen many times, meaning it was nothing new, it didn\u2019t serve their survival. But when it grew new berries, they noticed that it was new, and remembered that it had berries because it may help at some point in their life.\nWhen you start with a project to build, your mind expands to notice things that will aid in that project\u2019s survival.\nLike how The Power Of Now was relevant to my situation in life. The lessons registered in my awareness. The dopamine from that novel discovery gave me the excitement to implement immediately.\nIf you don\u2019t pay attention, you don\u2019t see.\nHaving a project to focus your attention allows you to see what you normally wouldn\u2019t.\nThis isn\u2019t just a learning hack, it is a quality-of-life hack, which we will enhance 10-fold in the next section.\n2) The Law Of Inspired Action\nI only write when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes at nine every morning. \u2014 William Faulkner\nEveryone knows that they act better on inspiration.\nPeople love to watch \u201cbest chest workout\u201d videos before training chest at the gym.\nI love reading the authors that inspire me before I sit down to write.\nWith a project, you are enticed to learn in accordance with it.\nIf you are building a business, you will naturally gravitate toward the information that gives you inspiration for building said business.\nBut you have to start building the damn business.\n3) Specific Knowledge\nIf you\u2019ve been on this newsletter for a bit, you know that I\u2019m a fan of this advice:\nStart, then learn.\nWhen you start, even when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, you will encounter problems.\nThese problems will induce struggle and prime your mind to learn.\nThese problems will also give you something specific to research.\nYou won\u2019t be learning blindly, without context, or from somebody who isn\u2019t teaching you how to do exactly what you want to do. When you learn blindly, you gain too much information fat. Like when you do a dirty bulk vs a lean bulk when trying to gain muscle\u2026 eventually you\u2019ll feel slow, tired, and groggy to the point of cutting the fat.\nDon\u2019t ask questions. Don\u2019t learn blindly. Start building something, then ask or research to solve the specific problems that pop up.\nThen repeat for a decade.\nYou Are The Project \u2014 Tying It All Together\nIf you want to learn faster, don't start learning.\n\n\u2013 Outline a project\n\u2013 Start building it out\n\u2013 Learn along the way\n\nToo many people get trapped in tutorial hell, stacking up useless knowledge as brain fog.\n\nStart > encounter a problem > seek specific knowledge to overcome it.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 11, 2022\nLet\u2019s take it up a notch.\nBuilding helps you retain more knowledge.\nBut teaching helps you retain even more. Teaching is another modality that locks in the experience you gain from building.\nSo, why not combine the two so that we create a life of serendipity, synchronicity, and good dopamine?\nWe do this by turning you into the project.\nThis implies holistic development.\nPersonal development doesn\u2019t only come from improving yourself, it comes from the impact you make on the world.\nIn other words, your business.\nOr for those that \u201cresonate\u201d with the term business, exchange that it for your life\u2019s work, your calling, or how you plan to leave the world better than you left it.\nThe polarity of selfishness and selflessness.\nImproving yourself, then helping others improve. Sending the elevator back down. Climbing the mountain and leaving a trail behind you that others can follow.\nDocumenting your journey so others can evolve faster.\nDoing your part to raise the collective consciousness.\nThat\u2019s what \u201cbusiness\u201d is, yet many mistake it for some mega-corporation that sucks the life out of well\u2026 your life.\nI\u2019ve done this (and helped thousands of others) turn themselves into a business so they can study their interests, pass down their findings, and have a creative income leaning into their nature as a builder and teacher.\nSo, let\u2019s tie everything we\u2019ve learned into 6 steps:\n1) Set An Intention\nSet a goal. Create a purpose. Think about your why. However you want to frame it.\nMake an intention to improve your life, to actualize your potential.\nThis sets your focus on the future while encouraging you to channel energy toward that vision. The energy you channel comes from your daily actions.\nEverything you consume starts to fuel your vision.\n2) Schedule A Creativity Block\nEveryone and their mother knows that they should schedule time for focused work, but what fuels that focused work?\nIf you are a creative, are you hunting for ideas in your free time? Or are you \u201ccreating\u201d on an empty tank?\nDo you value the spontaneous nature of creativity, or are you a slave to regimented work and productivity apps?\nI\u2019m not telling you to rid yourself of routine, efficiency, and productivity. I\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s only one piece of the puzzle.\nSchedule a 30-minute walk every day.\nOn this walk, you can:\nListen to an audiobook or podcast related to your intention\nContemplate your future and let your mind work through problems\nGet yourself away from the distractions that would keep you in a non-creative state\nWhen you shift your focus from external to internal, the Default Mode Network (a psychology term) comes into play. This is when your mind starts munching on the information you\u2019ve consumed to bring new discoveries to your conscious mind. (The opposite of living in a state of stress-induced narrow focus).\n3) Create A Note Taking System\nI could write an entire book on proper note-taking, so instead of writing it here, just download my free note-taking system (and 7-day challenge to use it most effectively).\nWhat will you be writing down in your notes?\nAny information, insight, or discovery that will fuel your efforts to build.\nWhen your mind is set on a goal for the future, your field of awareness expands. You begin to filter signal from noise, whether it feels like you are or not.\nLike when you discover a car for the first time. You\u2019ve never paid close attention to it, but you love the way it looks. Then, like magic, you start to notice that car everywhere.\nMy friend and editor Devan has hated the Jeep Gladiator since it came to market, now he\u2019s cursed with seeing them 3 to 4 times a day.\nImagine if you loved the idea of improving your mind, body, and finances \u2014 you would start to spot opportunities every single day (that would normally slip right under your nose).\n4) Build Every Aspect Of Your Life\nYou aren't seeing progress because you\u2019re obsessed with the polished end result, not the process that created it.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 11, 2022\nYou have to understand that you are building.\nHow long would it take to build a mansion by yourself?\n20 years? A lifetime?\nThat\u2019s exactly the point.\nFall in love with infinite games.\nTry everything that interests you. Then double down on the thing that you could see yourself doing for the rest of your life. Yes, this takes time, experimentation, and 6-12 months of patience.\nIf you don\u2019t like the sound of that, sit down and think of what the other option is. I bet you won\u2019t like the sound of that even more.\nSnap yourself out of the instant gratification mindset. You must actively construct your life on a daily basis.\nStart with 30-60 minutes.\nWhat do you do during that time?\nHit the gym. Write for the sake of digital leverage and income. Self-educate when you don\u2019t have clarity on the problem you encountered while building.\nIf you don\u2019t make time to build, you are assigned time to build for someone else.\n5) Teach What You Know\nAs we discussed, building is an incredible way to retain specific knowledge in alignment with the life you are trying to build.\nTo retain even more of what you learn, let me introduce you to the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Effect.\nIn short, it\u2019s \u201clearning by teaching.\u201d\nWhen you pair genuine curiosity with building a project, then teaching what you\u2019ve learned, you increase your level of articulation more than any other method.\nClearly, my favorite way to encapsulate all of these is by stepping into the digital arena.\nEmployers are hiring based on your public resume (social media account). You can teach what you learn to build digital leverage in the form of an audience. And when you\u2019re ready, you can create a product or service to turn your interests into income.\nWhen you teach about your passions, you tap into a new level of serendipity in everyday life.\n6) Turn It Into Your Life\u2019s Work\nThe amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you\u2019re passionate about combined with the total number of people to who this is effectively communicated. \u2014 Jason Roberts\nWork is a necessary part of life, and for most, it consumes a large percentage of their waking hours.\nFor many, this work lacks interest. They took the conventional path that was laid out for them and live in a state of slightly elevated stress (which is terrible for your creative problem-solving).\nIs this what you want?\nIf the duality of work and rest is to be maintained \u2014 meaning \u201cretirement\u201d is a dream where you will still work on something \u2014 do you want 70% of your life to be consumed doing something you hate, or even slightly dislike?\nNo? Here\u2019s what I would do.\nResearch what you feel pulled to research.\nDon\u2019t get distracted. Let it pull you deep into a rabbit hole of discovery.\nUnderstand that sustained curiosity + excitement = passion\nPractice sustaining that passion with everything we\u2019ve talked about here.\nNote down your findings, build a project, and begin teaching others.\nI\u2019ve talked about productizing yourself via the one person business multiple times as well as becoming a value creator.\nWhat many don\u2019t realize is that products start off as projects.\nIf you ARE the project, when you put yourself in public, you become a product that people will want to invest in.\nProjectize yourself, then productize yourself.\nNow, understand that you don\u2019t launch a product when it\u2019s perfect, that\u2019s an impossible goal.\nEntrepreneurs launch MVPs. Minimum Viable Products. A project that provides value enough to charge for, launch, and continue improving it with time.\nYou are your life\u2019s work.\nYour minimum viable product was created at birth.\nLaunch, build, teach.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nFirst, if you\u2019re looking to incorporate everything we\u2019ve discussed in this letter \u2014 Digital Economics is open for enrollment until November 23rd. This is only for the Masters curriculum.\nJoin here if you want to secure your future as a value creator.\nLast week, I posted a YouTube video about the 11 things I wish I knew when I started my one person business. Tomorrow, I will be posting \u201cThe Power Of Being Alone,\u201d which will help you become your authentic self.\nWatch both here.\nIn Modern Mastery, we had incredible discussions on monetizing from the start when building an audience (not waiting until some imaginary follower number to make an income). We\u2019ve grown by over 250 members in the last week. The Discord has been more active than ever. I will be posting a training this week on \u2018The Art Of Broad Specificity.\u2019 In other words, how to make your niche interests interesting to a broad amount of people (so you actually get engagement and grow with your content).\nReaders can join for $5."

        "content": "I\u2019ve always had the goal of being a deep, original, and free thinker.\nIt hasn\u2019t always been a \u201cconscious\u201d goal though.\nAs the process of self-actualization goes, I started with a shallow and unconscious goal.\nI wanted to be a deep thinker so others thought I was smart, intellectual, and deep.\nI didn\u2019t really care about being deep, I cared about being accepted by others. Being different, but in a non-mediocre way.\nWith time, and after burning through that karma, I realized that becoming a deep thinker is more than that.\nIt is a requirement for winning in the game of life and business.\nIt is the only way to escape replacement in an era where anyone can learn anything.\nIt is how you create, build, and construct a life that allows you to do whatever you want (while others object to their limiting beliefs, rather than just building a solution to them).\nBefore we can understand what deep thinking is, we need to understand the opposite: shallow thinking.\nShallow thinking is taking what you see as real, or never seeing beyond the surface of your perceptions.\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense, because every individual is limited by their unique perceptions, which are dictated by their environment, experience, and state of consciousness. An animal that has a better sense of hearing, for example, can listen in to frequencies (that exist) that we will never directly experience or comprehend.\nLike reading a post on social media about the best diet or business model, not experimenting with an open mind, and going on to yell that it is the best diet or business model for everyone without exception.\nDeep thinking is:\nBecoming aware of the limits your mind creates.\nHolding everything you perceive in the realm of possibility until filtered with direct experience.\nQuestioning everything, especially the thoughts, beliefs, and biases that you think are absolutely true without exception.\nIn short, closed-mindedness is the antagonist of deep thinking.\nBut what exactly is closed-mindedness?\nIt\u2019s accepting the matrix as your reality.\nThe Matrix Is Not A Fantasy\nTo be conscious is a struggle between novelty and habit.\nWhen most people talk about \u201cthe matrix\u201d they think about the classic movie where the main character is offered the \u201cred\u201d pill or the \u201cblue\u201d pill.\nI\u2019m not talking about this matrix, but your choice to take the \u201cred\u201d pill to create a glitch in this matrix is more than possible.\nYou see, all understanding is metaphorical.\nWe get hints of truth from watching this movie. We can comprehend the essence behind what it\u2019s saying, but the notion of the \u201cmatrix\u201d is a symbol. It is a metaphor pointing at some form of truth.\nSymbol (noun) \u2013 a thing that represents or stands for something else, especially a material object representing something abstract.\nSince the beginning of time, before we *invented* language, we interpreted reality by recognizing patterns and relationships.\nWe used symbols to represent these phenomena or the experience that came from those aspects of reality.\nNow, what you have to understand is that a symbol is a representation. It is not what that thing is.\nWith time, groups of people began to share and attach meaning to these symbols. We had a way to communicate. But, people had different perspectives of these symbols based on their environment and prior experience, meaning that they have no absolute meaning. There are minor nuances to the meaning of any one thing that differs from individual to individual.\nCrucial note: these symbols are mental interpretations. They are mental constructions, a layer over reality. A limit that our minds\u2019 imposed on the infinite.\nWith time, these mental constructions became more advanced. We\u2019ve constructed language, culture, society, the school system, government, and a load of other expectations, assumptions, and predictions (called \u201cbeliefs\u201d) for what life has been and should be.\nSo, think of the matrix as a web of expectations that have been conditioned into our minds, so much so that we do not question them. Every-thing in the room you are in right now has a meaning that you projected on it without any conscious effort. Even the things that aren\u2019t in your room \u2013 your entire worldview contains the meaning of certain aspects of reality that you have or may come into contact with due to the spread of information.\nCycles, Rhythms, Patterns, & Normalization\nYou can live and die inside these intellectual structures if you choose to. But people of curiosity\u2026 usually find themselves unsatisfied with the conventional answers. \u2013 Terrence McKenna\nNot only have we created a web of expectations, but these expectations become engrained in our psyche through repetition \u2013 like how you get better at a lift in the gym by performing repetitions. When we do this enough, we call it \u201cconditioning.\u201d\nI could go on and on about how robotic we are as species. We have much less \u201cself-control\u201d than we think.\nAs an example, think about the cycles in your personal life.\nYou have a sleep cycle, an ingestion cycle (eating), a work cycle, an excretion cycle, and sex cycle (even if you don\u2019t have a partner, you dirty dog). It\u2019s important to note that these are only a portion of the habits we have in our personal life.\nThese personal cycles can vary per the individual, like how bodybuilders go through bulking and cutting \u201cseasons.\u201d\nEven more, there are business cycles. Sometimes your content does well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019ll have high months and low months. It\u2019s inevitable. The only thing you can do is be mindful that you are in one of those low periods (while preparing for a high).\nSpeaking of seasons, the world, universe, and cosmos as a whole seem to go through cycles that impact human behavior from the top down. Cosmic > worldly > cultural > societal > social > personal. All have cycles. This even reflects in politics or government.\nLike how you \u201cmirror\u201d someone else\u2019s body in a social situation, or celebrate Halloween as a cultural event, or get especially emotional when political elections come up.\nEverything we\u2019ve discussed in this chapter is something for you to contemplate and deconstruct.\nThis illusory \u201cmatrix\u201d of expectations for what is, was, and should be are chaining you to a life of limited potential.\nThe Matrix is a web of thoughts, beliefs, biases, expectations, and assumptions that create your worldview. Knowing is second order, being is first order. Something has to come into being before we can add a mental layer of knowing on top of it.\nThe Matrix is what you think you know.\nIf you can\u2019t \u201cbe\u201d it, you can only \u201cknow\u201d it. That is, you can only register a symbol of that being in your mind. An image, idea, or thought that we project meaning on. A representation, not what it is.\nBreaking away from your robotic nature is how you escape the matrix. Because if you want to become a deep thinker, and allow that to transfer into your content, business, and life as a whole \u2013 you don\u2019t want to think within the matrix. That would be thinking the same thoughts as everyone else.\nWhat will you find as you explore the mental constructions that compose your sense of self?\nThe mystical, profound, and unknown \u2013 waiting to be explored.\nThis is why I urge creators to study spirituality.\nOnce you awaken to the fact that there is an infinite intelligence beneath our compulsive thoughts, you can consciously explore that intelligence. You can bring the essence of your findings to life in your writing, videos, and creations. This is the esoteric method of originality as a one-person business.\nExploring The Unknown (Experience Exposure)\nYour edge is where you stop short, or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to your fears. \u2013 David Deida\nThe human mind creates limits on the infinite potential of itself. In relation to deep thinking, we are all stuck in a surface-level bubble of thoughts that repeat themselves according to the cycles of life and web of expectations that come with it.\nIn order to reverse this effect, we have to create a glitch in the matrix by pushing the boundaries of what we know.\nWe have to expose ourselves to deeper experiences, both tangible and intangible if we want to be deep, articulate, and clear thinkers in a world of distraction and noise.\nNow, we don\u2019t want to just hurl ourselves into the unknown.\nWhile that is a great tactic for the seasoned explorer that leads to a season of intense progress \u2013 like moving into a place that is 2x your rent to force yourself to make more money \u2013 we want to take it slow at the start.\nOur goal is to get a bit uncomfortable, puncture the known with consistent effort, and let obsession pull us deeper when we make a novel discovery. To create a glitch in the Matrix and get a peak at infinity.\nLike when a passage from a book finally makes sense and opens your mind to an entirely new world (that we don\u2019t want to get lost in).\nTo reiterate:\nThe Known is the web of expectations that we mentally reside in. It is the comfortable home that our mind can resort to when its survival is threatened.\nThe Unknown is the fabric of reality, the land of infinite potential. An interconnected playground for those that are brave enough to push deeper and deeper with time, practice, and mindfulness.\nIf you can\u2019t grasp this yet, that\u2019s okay.\nThe \u201cconstruct aware\u201d stage of ego development isn\u2019t available to you until you\u2019ve gone through years of conscious practice to reprogram your mind. However, your mind can peek into this level of awareness if the words are just right, that is what I\u2019m trying to do here.\nHow To Break The Chains Of The Known\nTo understand the progression of diving into the unknown, we must understand the theory of states and stages.\nStates: a temporary state of consciousness that you can break into at anytime. Like taking a psychedelic, reading a quote that eases your worries, or feeling extra creative after you write a few words.\nStages: a permanent stage of consciousness, like reaching a new level in a game where you have access to the powers you could only previously receive with a power up. Like a baseline level of happiness. This takes development over time, and does not eliminate regressing into lower states of consciousness, like being stuck in a rut.\nOur goal is to reach new stages of the unknown. To expose yourself to more experience, which leads to a deeper awareness of what is possible.\nIf it helps, look at a \u201cstage\u201d as a new baseline that you reach in income, calmness, or any other area of your life that you can develop.\nAs an example, a year and a half ago I hit my first $50K month in business. This was a temporary state, but my baseline monthly income had increased to $20K. This year, I\u2019ve had two states where I\u2019ve surpassed $100K in a month. My baseline \u201cstage\u201d has increased to $50K or so.\nIf I wanted to maintain $100K per month, it wouldn\u2019t be sustainable. I would be too far into the unknown for a prolonged period of time. I would get lossed, stressed, and overwhelmed to the point of diminishing returns.\nHowever, there are times when intense growth makes sense. When you have absolute clarity that you can achieve a goal and need to create a stressful environment for yourself.\nLike when you drop everything and move across the country. It\u2019s scary, but you know it will lead to the most growth you\u2019ve experienced. Your income and lifestyle will have to match the stress that you\u2019ve created in order to normalize it.\nLiving at the edge of the known also applies to how you learn and execute.\nIn business, you wouldn\u2019t copy a billion-dollar business\u2019s advertising strategy if you haven\u2019t made your first dollar.\nThere are levels, baselines that you need to reach for your awareness to expand to the point of understanding.\nIf you tried to copy their strategies, you would utterly fail because you don\u2019t recognize that you don\u2019t have the same brand awareness, product quality, advertising budget, or anything that would make sense for their business.\nIf you are lost, the answer is education.\n\nIf you are educated, the answer is action.\n\nIf you are acting, the answer is consistency.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) March 29, 2022\nSo, it only makes sense to match knowledge with execution.\nYou want to learn from someone a few steps ahead of you while they still understand the level you are at. Then, you want to teach someone a few steps behind you so you solidify that knowledge in your head.\nThis is why I encourage everyone to create an educational product ASAP. Modern Mastery has all of the products I\u2019ve created since the start of my journey, because if I were to teach what I\u2019m doing now, it wouldn\u2019t help those that are just starting out.\nThis is how you chase \u201cgood dopamine.\u201d\nCheap dopamine comes from receiving novelty without struggle.\nGood dopamine comes from creating novelty through struggle.\nMeaning, you have to set your own goals, educate yourself on how to reach them, and execute at the edge of your fear.\nWe could consider cheap dopamine as a cycle in itself. Another habitual cycle of checking your phone and frying the receptors in your brain, which prevents you from thinking deep about the relevance of your intrinsic desires. This leads to finding solace in the familiar mental home you\u2019ve always resided in \u2013 and never executing on the better future that your soul yearns for.\nWhile there are many methods to \u201cbreaking out of your comfort zone,\u201d these are the ones that anyone can do at any time. If you want to travel the world, try psychedelics, or go homeless for a day \u2013 be my guest, get creative. But, these should become a consistent practice in your life:\n1) Reading\nWhen you read, don\u2019t stop at the first hint of struggle.\nIf you can\u2019t comprehend it, but want to, keep reading. Let your subconscious marinate in the ideas and let time make sense of the ideas.\nI have had multiple times in my life where I didn\u2019t understand a book, just to come back to it a year later to understand all of it. When I read it, it had an entirely new meaning for the stage of life I was in.\nNow, when you catch a whiff of something exciting, a peak into the unknown, pursue it full force. Notice the excitement, write down your discovery, and start researching online to find out more.\n2) Writing\nEvery writer struggles with writer\u2019s block.\n90% of them view this as a bad thing, when it is a sign that they are on the right path.\nWhen you struggle to articulate your thoughts, your mind is primed to lock that articulation pattern in your mind \u2013 if you stick it out.\nWhat do you do when you struggle with creative aspects of work?\nLike Steve Jobs, Tarantino, or even the ancient greeks\u2026 you surrender.\nYou do nothing related to that aspect of your work.\nGo on a walk, lay by the pool, go out with friends, go on a hike\u2026 do anything that will activate the Default Mode Network in your brain. That\u2019s when your mind goes to work to piece together the ideas in your subconscious mind.\nLike clockwork, the answer will pop into your conscious mind. Have your notes ready \ud83d\ude09\nThis is what many know as the \u201caha!\u201d moment.\nAs a creator, this is what you are trying to create for your readers. So if you experience this moment, share it. Someone will benefit.\nIf you want to learn how to write (in a way that builds a business, income, and leverage for a future going digital) check out The 2 Hour Writer to prevent yourself from being automated out.\nPer the Feynman Technique, teaching what you learn blows every other method of learning out of the water. It\u2019s how you retain the information you consume.\n3) Teaching\nOur goal is to become a deep, original, and free thinker so it can spill into the impact we make on the world through business.\nThis implies that you will have to educate your readers. You will have to become a teacher and distill your findings in a way that makes sense. You will have to become a value creator.\nHere\u2019s the Feynman Technique in a nutshell to start your teaching journey (with my little twist for a creator business):\n1) Choose and study a concept.\nChoose the interest that you could see yourself pursuing for the rest of your life.\n2) Teach it to a child.\nMany writers tell you to write at a 4th grade level\u2026 don\u2019t do that, instead, explain it to a 4 year old with metaphors and other methods that will make sense to them, therefore make sense to more people.\n3) Learn more, fill in knowledge gaps, and simplify further.\nMake an effort to study all perspectives of the topic. Seek to prove yourself wrong and double down on the fundamentals. If you are a carnivore, study veganism with an open mind\u2026 or live in the matrix you\u2019ve put yourself in and get uncontrollably angry and reactive toward them.\n4) The Builder\u2019s Mentality\nSince I can remember, I\u2019ve always had a side project to build. Whether it be my mind, body, or business.\nAs a teenager, I got obsessed with lifting. I set an intention to build my body and allowed my daily actions to reflect my pursuit of that goal. I broke out of my known routine, studied how to build muscle, and experimented with different diets and training styles.\nA builder:\nCreates novelty through exploring their interests. This demands you to be conscious of and remove distractions from your life.\nLeans into their findings by creating a goal in their mind. This almost happens naturally, but you can write it out to solidify it.\nTreats their goal as a project. Meaning it is a consistent work in progress, and will have to be maintained for life once \u201ccompleted.\u201d\nThey know they will pick up excess \u201cfat,\u201d and will have to trim it according to life\u2019s cycles and rhythms.\nThis applies to every aspect of your life. Your mind, body, business, and relationships are projects that need to be actively constructed, maintained, and rebuilt at times. That way, you don\u2019t succumb to the structure of the existing matrix.\nTo recap:\nThe key to being a deep thinker it to not let your mind-set on what it already thinks it knows.\nIf you want to separate yourself from the sea of the same, then you have to explore the unknown by breaking the conditioned mental patterns in your life.\nAll of this requires conscious practice and awareness. This isn\u2019t an immediate hack that will change your life. This letter is written for awareness.\nNow that you are aware, you have something to improve.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nLast week\u2019s video went absolutely nuts.

        "content": "\u201cBe yourself!\u201d\nHow annoying has that advice gotten?\nWant to start writing? Just be yourself!\nWant to start a personal brand? Be yourself!\nWant to land a hot date? Be yourself!\nIt\u2019s good advice, but not to the masses. They don\u2019t understand what it really means to \u201cbe themselves.\u201d Why?\nBecause they are somebody else, and they are viewing the world through that lens, not the one they created.\nThey went to school and unconsciously adopted personality traits, bad habits, and a notion of what\u2019s possible in this life.\nThey went to college with a fresh start, but went through another round of conditioning, layering over their being once more.\nThey got a job and accepted the company\u2019s goals as their own. The unconscious misalignment leads to dread, despair, and the death of a soul that leaves a robotic, animalistic corpse of a human being that lives in a perpetual state of survival. A slave to the external world.\nWhen the external aligns with the internal, that is, when the goals you create align with who you really are, the unconscious sends resources to your conscious mind to execute on those goals faster.\nThe unconscious mind can manage 11 million bits of information per second while the conscious mind only 40-50 bits of information. Imagine how much untapped power you are sitting on. All you need to do is tap into it.\nIn previous letters, we\u2019ve discussed how manual labor, specialization, and earning with your time is not sustainable.\nRobots that perform specific tasks are just that, robots. They are being automated out left and right.\nThe future belongs to those that can leverage their creative power. The power of their mind.\nBut, if you try to leverage a mind that was created by the external world, you will simply be joining a different kind of rat race.\nWe want originality, personality, and wisdom.\nWe want to have visionary ideas that change people\u2019s lives for the better.\nThat\u2019s what we are talking about today. Let\u2019s dive in.\nExistence Is Relationship\nIn a world where there are no eyes, the sun would not be light. And in a world where there were no soft skins, rocks would not be hard, nor in a world where there were no muscles would they be heavy. Existence is relationship, and you are smack in the middle of it. \u2013 Alan Watts\nIn a world where there are no others, the self would not exist.\nYour identity \u2013 or \u201cthe self\u201d \u2013 can only exist when you make a distinction between you and everything around you.\nThis is what spirituality, non-duality, and Buddhism are pointing toward. Their aim is to make you realize that the self is not separate from the universe, it is the universe.\nThe goal of those teachings, and enlightenment as a whole, is the end of suffering.\nSuffering happens when you fail to recognize the infinite intelligence (interconnectedness) that life is. Suffering happens when you fail to zoom out and see the big picture.\nSuffering happens when you see the world from the lens of comparison. You zoom in on the difference between self and other.\nEnjoyment happens when you see the world from the lens of connection. You zoom out and create a holistic perspective. You highlight the similarities, why those matter, and appreciate the intelligence that connects everything the untrained eye would see as separate.\nThis is \u201clove\u201d by many spiritual teachings, even though I feel that term confuses the modern world, which is why I use the words \u201cenjoyment\u201d and \u201cappreciation.\u201d\nTwo steps to happiness:\n\nZoom in on what's important.\nZoom out from everything else.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 2, 2022\nWhen you are zoomed in on things that don\u2019t matter, your mind is zoomed in, meaning it is closed-minded. You prevent your mind from seeing any further than what fills the content of your consciousness.\nNarrow focus is great for things like productivity and purpose, when you are actively pursuing a meaningful goal, but this is not the case for most people.\nMost people are in a perpetual state of stress-induced narrow (contracted) focus. A negative thought pops into their head and that immerses all of their attention. They can\u2019t see beyond the thought itself. The thought becomes their world, and the importance of the world ceases to exist.\nWhat does this have to do with \u201cbeing yourself?\u201d\nHere\u2019s a tweet I wrote the other day:\nPeople love to say \u201cbe yourself,\u201d but tend to forget that it took your entire life to get to this point of not being yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take thousands of hours to reprogram your mind to act from a place of consistent authenticity.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 25, 2022\nYou see, since the day you popped into this world, your conscious mind has been interpreting the sensory information it receives and storing it in memory.\nThis is necessary to be able to operate in the external world, but isn\u2019t it crazy how this works? How do we share the same language? How do we have a specific amount of career paths to pursue? I have many questions. We could live in an entirely different reality, and I would argue people on polar ends of the Earth do, we just don\u2019t understand their perspective.\nThe point is, by the time you are 18, \u201cyourself\u201d is created by your environment. Humans are creatures of habit, your mind forms grooves with time, like the Grand Canyon with water, called neural networks.\nThrough societal, cultural, and social conditioning, and if left unconscious, you have zero control over \u201cbeing yourself.\u201d\nYou are quite literally a product of the external world.\nSocial media has created the problem of over-socialization, and quite frankly, socialization makes you stupid. When an unconfident mind is exposed to hundreds of thousands of confident thoughts, advice, and opinions, your mind tries to latch on to those.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll find yourself speaking like the echo chamber you surround yourself in. You\u2019ll be thinking the thoughts of others, not your own thoughts.\nI find it funny that many people would cringe at the thought of being with their friends for an extended period of time, but will log on to social media (1000s of friends telling you what to do) and act like it isn\u2019t different, or worse.\nI\u2019m not saying any of this is bad, and there is no immediate solution. I\u2019m saying this to spread awareness, as that is the first step to improvement. You cannot improve what you are not aware of. You cannot remove what you are not aware of.\nDon\u2019t just blindly trust what I\u2019m saying here.\nAs you are going about this week, try to catch yourself being someone else.\nNotice the words you pick up, and if you want to be using those words.\nNotice what decisions you make, and if those decisions are influenced by someone else (online or offline).\nAnd if they are influenced by others, are those decisions beneficial to your goals, or theirs? Where is the \u201cmoney\u201d flowing?\n\u201cWho wrote the software in your head, and are you sure you want it running there?\u201d \u2013 Master Of Twitter (and attention) Elon Musk\nThe Power Of Being Alone (How To Be Yourself)\nYou can\u2019t be yourself if you\u2019re never alone with yourself.\nAs with everything, this requires balance. Balance does not mean split down the middle. Balance means a conscious effort to prevent either extreme from taking over.\nIf your goal is to make a dent on this world, you will have to expose yourself to other people. You will have to provide the most value to other people.\nThe problem with over-socialization: your thoughts, writing, and work are not unique, original, or novel. Meaning, you will get the same results as everyone else.\nThis is especially important for knowledge workers, value creators, and really anyone that doesn\u2019t want to trade money for time. Time and manual labor is a dead end (that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a viable option for beginners). You have to earn an income with creative ideas, solutions, and content.\nHow are you going to do that when you are putting out the same information as everyone in your niche?\nIf you want to reverse the effects of being on social media, keeping up with the trendiest joke for your friend group, or meeting new people that you think are better than you (so you adopt aspects of their personality) \u2013 you have to make time for being alone.\nWhat\u2019s the first step to \u201cbeing yourself?\u201d\nPrioritizing yourself.\nBeing selfish.\nSelflessness requires selfish values:\n\n\u2013 Self-control\n\u2013 Self-reliance\n\u2013 Self-reflection\n\u2013 Self-education\n\u2013 Self-awareness\n\u2013 Self-employment\n\u2013 Self-management\n\nIt's impossible to be selfless when you are dependent on others for your survival.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 28, 2022\nI realize that I left an important point out of that list: self-experimentation.\nTake it on yourself to \u201cfigure it out.\u201d\nDon\u2019t outsource your health to convenience.\nDon\u2019t outsource your thinking to social media.\nDon\u2019t outsource your career to the school system.\nTreat your life as a science project. The essence of science is trial and error. Try everything and eliminate what doesn\u2019t work. Be your own personal trainer. Be your own business mentor. Be your own therapist.\nWhat do you do during your alone time?\nHere are a few of my favorite methods for thinking clear, critical, and deep:\n1) Go On A Contemplative Walk\nIf you aren\u2019t going on at least one daily walk, do you even follow me? What are you doing brother / sister? This isn\u2019t only about \u201cgetting your steps in.\u201d This is about:\nLiving longer\nHaving creative ideas\nStress regulation (to prevent unconscious narrow focus)\nGetting away from your screen\nA distractionless timeblock for listening to that book you\u2019ve been putting off\nWriting content (ideas just flow better when you\u2019re walking)\nDo you want me to go on? I could list off 10 more reasons.\nGO. ON. A. WALK.\nBut, when you do, contemplate.\nHold one idea in your head and let your mind dance with it. Let thoughts trigger thoughts. Sit back and observe. Open your focus so wide that everything in your sensory field is held lightly in your conscious awareness. Lean in to all 5 senses and let your subconscious take over.\nContemplate your vision.\nContemplate who you want to become.\nContemplate why you aren\u2019t who you want to become.\nContemplate who you are and if you created that identity (and if not, who did?)\nContemplate the idea that stuck out to you in something you read.\nContemplate why you hold specific beliefs and if those are closing your mind off to futher discovery.\nDig deep. Don\u2019t let the ego trap you in a cycle of compulsive negative thinking. Question.\nWhen your mind is stuck, move.\n2) Weekly Self-Reflection\nNobody knows exactly what they want in the future. It\u2019s literally impossible. There are infinite possibilities of what could happen in the next second.\nWe can \u201cguess\u201d with a mission, vision, and goals to follow \u2014 if we create them, rather than being assigned them \u2014 and those are helpful for guiding us in a positive direction.\nBut, you only know what will happen when it happens, and once it happens, we tend to forget about it and repeat mistakes left unconscious.\nSelf-reflection allows you to know with absolute certainty whether your actions were conducive or detrimental to your future.\nI like to think of this as the \u201cart of doing whatever you want.\u201d\nYou have to do what you want, even if it\u2019s for shallow reasons, and self-reflect to become conscious of the detriments of your actions.\nYou will never make the perfect decision. You just get better at making imperfect decisions.\n3) Write To Clarify Your Thoughts\nIf you can think, and speak, and write, you are absolutely deadly. Nothing can get in your way.\n\u2014 Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) November 30, 2021\nFew ideas can be held at the \u201ctop of mind.\u201d\nYour conscious brain can only process a certain amount of information. It can only hold a specific amount of content in its conscious awareness.\nMeaning, most of the things you think, read, and want to remember can\u2019t be given much attention. You have to note them down and clarify the thoughts in your head with the written word.\nIf you don't have ideas, read.\n\nIf you have ideas, but can't articulate them, write.\n\nIf you have ideas, and have the clarity to execute, build.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 25, 2022\nNow, I\u2019m a fan of efficiency.\nSo if you plan to build a one-person business, the way you will attract customers is through writing.\nEvery single person you look up to or buy from is a writer, whether they like to think of themselves as that or not.\nWriting is how you build leverage for a future going digital.\nDoesn\u2019t it make sense to pair writing for clarity and writing for an income?\nIf you\u2019re looking to learn how, check out The 2 Hour Writer.\n4) Question The Story Your Ego Fabricates\nNone of this is easy. It\u2019s extremely difficult.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that it all sounds so mystical either. This isn\u2019t a \u201cstep-by-step system to make a million dollars in 30 days.\u201d\nThat\u2019s an external game. It was constructed by man and the schematics are readily available.\nThis is an internal game. You will have to dance, fight, and battle with the ego over years and years. I\u2019m 10+ years in this game and it never ends (but it does get easier). It is infinite unless you opt out of external games to become a monk. Not many feel the pull to do that, and I don\u2019t believe it to be necessary, as the battle is what makes the story interesting.\nWatch where your mind goes as you are going about your life.\nThis practice is easiest on social media.\nAs you are scrolling on Twitter, notice how your mind will start a conversation with the post you read. What story is it creating out of nowhere? Why is it making you angry or happy? What aspects of that fabricated story do you agree or disagree with those points?\nExtract the essence of the post you read (or anything you see in life) as it is.\nAnd stay aware of how your mind will fill in the blanks to create its own picture.\nWhen you become aware, zoom out as far as you can. Gain meta-perspective and appreciate the situation for what it is.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nThe latest YouTube video, The One Person Business Model (How To Productize Yourself, went absolutely bonkers. It beat all of my prior videos analytics by 10X. I think we are finally hitting the \u201cnothing happens, then everything happens\u201d point in this journey.\nWatch it here.\nIn Modern Mastery, we had a workshop on making your ideas stick in the head of your readers with Max Bernstein. I will personally be incorporating the writing tips into my process.\nReaders can join for $5\nDigital Economics is off to a great start with 130+ students in this cohort. I\u2019m stoked to see what results we can get for everyone building leverage on the internet with their interests and personality."

        "content": "When I first started on this business journey, it was out of curiosity.\nI was observant.\nI observed those I didn\u2019t want to be like, and observed those I did.\nThe contrast between the two became very clear to me at a young age, around 15 years old at this time.\nOn one side of the coin, people were:\nUnfit\nUnhappy\nUnwilling to change\nA lifestyle chained to a weekly paycheck.\nOn the other side of the coin, people were:\nLiving their dream\nSpreading a great message\nInspiring people to be better\nMost of them were creators in the early days of social media.\nSome people will give you the classic, \u201cbut they\u2019re probably all unhappy deep down inside!\u201d\n*Instantly closes off any potential opportunity and goes back to their unhappy way of living*\nYou may be right, but if you know me, I like to question without bias (as much as my ego allows me).\nMeaning, why couldn\u2019t I be wealthy in all facets of life?\nI would have to directly experience the flashy lifestyle and talk with those people to be able to judge it, no?\nWhat if they were happy, just misunderstood by the masses?\nAnd if they were unhappy, why didn\u2019t they change it?\nThis led to me trying anything and everything they recommended.\nI tried the gym and fell in love with it.\nI tried new skills and fell in love with learning.\nI failed a bunch and fell off the path, but eventually came to a point where my knowledge, skillset, and experience had compounded to the point of \u201csuccess,\u201d by my standards.\nWith a vision for my future small consistent actions, I\u2019ve been able to build a one-person business that allows me to:\nResearch the things I love\nWrite about them in a creative way\nHave full control over how much I work\nHave full control over where I can live\nBuild products and services that would have helped me (so they can help you)\nThe only downside to this lifestyle is just that, you are in full control. If you don\u2019t have the skills to navigate that freedom, your mind may not be able to handle the disorder.\nIn this letter, I want to give unique and actionable lessons to help you accomplish the same.\nAnyone can do this, and someday I hope to see a wave of individuals that package up the value they have to offer as a human being and give their gift to the world. Conscious entrepreneurship.\nBefore we dive into the lessons, Digital Economics starts in 4 days. If you want to build a one-person business with the knowledge and skill you have, consider enrolling here.\n1) It\u2019s All Traffic & Offers\nBusiness is a game of creating a great product or service and putting it in front the right people.\nYes, there are details in the marketing, promotion strategy, and other things\u2026 but people get too caught up in that. If you were to go to a busy bar on a Saturday night (traffic) and hit on as many people as you could (offer) you would probably get laid. Too many people strive for perfection from the start and become an involuntary (financial) celibate.\nWhat many don\u2019t understand is that it is just that, a game.\nIt\u2019s not reserved for anyone.\nYou could affiliate for a product you\u2019ve purchased before, write a Twitter thread promoting it, pay people to retweet it, and make a full-time income from that alone if you\u2019re smart enough. Since the product is good, you should out-earn what you spend on paid promotions. That\u2019s the whole point of ads. ROI.\nThat\u2019s a beginner method, but helps you build an audience along the way. That way, when you\u2019re experienced enough, you can do the same for your own product or service. But, with time, you won\u2019t have to pay for the traffic, because you will have built it with great content.\nOf course, you can hold off on monetizing your brand for a bit while you build, but most people only do that because they\u2019re told to.\n2) You Need 3 Levers\nOnce you build leverage (by pulling the right levers consistently) you gain a freedom that others can\u2019t imagine.\nLet\u2019s act like you have something to sell. If you don\u2019t, that should be on your mind 24/7. You must contemplate it on long walks, immerse yourself in what people like you are selling, and be ready to go all in on building when inspiration strikes.\nA freelance, consulting, tutoring, or cohort service.\nOr a course, physical tool, membership, paid newsletter, or affiliate offer like discussed above.\nIf you don\u2019t know how, learn.\nNow, you need to strike a balance of 3 things.\nGrowth, nurture, and monetization.\nThese are levers. Meaning that you need to learn, discover, and perform the actions that are fundamental to these areas. These are done almost on a daily basis and should be systemized once you find what works for your business.\nLever 1) Growth\nIf your following or brand isn\u2019t growing on a consistent basis, there\u2019s a problem. Fix it.\nMost people don\u2019t grow because they think they are above content styles that lead to growth.\nContent, and getting traffic to that content, is how you grow.\n90% of the market are beginners.\nThat means your content on top-of-funnel socials should mostly be basic advice relating to your chosen interests or expertise.\nYour social media brand should be broad enough to attract these beginners, so you can nuture them toward the more advanced stuff.\nSide note: you CAN go super niche on social media, I just don\u2019t like doing that personally. You put yourself in a box, give yourself less room to pivot, and aren\u2019t able to talk about a variety of interests that intersect (productivity, self-improvement, and business overlap incredibly well, as an example).\nLever 2) Nurture\nIf you are a value creator (instead of an entertainer, meme account, or commentary account) then your entire job is to educate your audience.\nIf your social media is attracting a wide net of people, you need to educate and nurture them to the point of purchasing a product of yours. This is how you change peoples lives, develop authority, and show that you are more than just looks.\nA newsletter, lead magnet, or other long form content is necessary for value creators. This is where you flex what you know and teach about your interests (related to what you are selling).\nBrands that skip this education step will always have a difficult time monetizing their audience.\nLever 3) Monetization\nDon\u2019t lie to yourself, you\u2019re here to make money. If you\u2019re just starting, that\u2019s the entire reason you are thinking about doing this. The more honest you are with yourself about this, the more authentic you can be when selling. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this, you need money. Don\u2019t let people make you feel bad about wanting to get the thing that controls your life under your own control.\nEventually, you will find deeper meaning and purpose in your work, but either way, you have to sustain that.\nYou need to test different promotions, angles, and how you promote.\nAre you going to promote once a week with a Twitter thread? Are you only going to promote in your newsletter? Are you going to promote once a day under a relevant post?\nOnce you know what brings in sales, you can start to systemize it and make it a part of your routine, that way the income becomes more sustainable.\nIn Digital Economics, we help you systemize your brand, content, and product to follow these 3 pillars of social leverage. This is what most one-person businesses miss, and they become a commodity because of it.\n3) Question Everything\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that \u201cquestion everything\u201d has become so mainstream that it has lost it\u2019s impact as advice.\nQuestioning is the driver of my success in business.\n\u201cYou have to niche down!\u201d\nWho said?\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sell until you hit 10,000 followers!\u201d\nWho said?\n\u201cYou can\u2019t work 2 hours a day and make $1M a year!\u201d\nI haven\u2019t accomplished this yet, but WHO SAID?!\nFuck your limiting beliefs right off and prove them wrong (for the benefit of yourself and your followers).\nThis is where the fun comes into play. The game proposes a challenge that will kick you into the flow state.\nBe stubborn.\nWhen people say you can\u2019t do something you want to do, be the first to find the way.\nThat\u2019s how you gain the knowledge that will build your fame and fortune.\n4) Deconstruct Everything\nConsciousness and creativity are the drivers of success in the age of information. They are how you think, live, and impact on a deeper level.\nOn the flip side of the coin, unconsciousness and closed-mindedness are a guaranteed path to mediocrity.\nCreativity is connecting the dots of consciousness.\nYou experience something by becoming directly conscious of that moment in life.\nYou become more conscious by not closing your mind off to any given tip of the iceberg you see.\nEvery-thing is the tip of the iceberg.\nEvery-thing is a whole that is composed of parts.\nEverything is a thing. A unit of thought. A figment of consciousness. A part and a whole.\nThose parts also compose other wholes, meaning they connect.\nThat\u2019s all life is. The cosmos is a whole that has divided itself into infinite parts. Each of those parts are wholes in themselves. Humans are wholes. They are probes of self-discovery. As we discover ourselves, the cosmos discovers itself. There is nothing to do, but everything to do. Have fun with it.\nYou dive into the iceberg through questioning.\nWhole: a book on productivity\nParts: principles of productivity, tactics for being more productive, stories and anecdotes that hold your attention and help you understand what you are learning.\nBy noting these down, can you use one of those interesting stories or anecdotes to make another point?\nIn Digital Economics, I talk about how Electronic Dance Music is like being a creator.\nEvery EDM producer has their own unique sound, they blend together different sounds, and walk people through a series of highs and lows.\nA creator has their own unique tone, they blend together ideas, and walk people through the highs and lows of their life.\nI could also use EDM live sets to illustrate the highs and lows of life. If the DJ only plays hard music without a break, it is boring. If your life is all high, and no low, it gets boring.\nPractice deconstructing the next thing (literally anything) you see. Ask questions.\n5) Don\u2019t Quit, Pivot\nEveryone is worried about shiny object syndrome.\nWhat you need to understand is that you are allowed to \u201cstart over\u201d from a position of compounded knowledge.\nYou\u2019re allowed to start over from a better position, with transferrable skills, and the new skills that sparked you to \u201cstart over.\u201d\nIf you learn web design and see an opportunity to use that skill and go all in on copywriting, why would you not?\nThat\u2019s not shiny object syndrome, that\u2019s skill stacking. It will make you more money in the long run.\nIf you are still working toward the same big and broad goal, like financial freedom, you are required to pivot along the way.\nIf you give up on that big goal, you are giving up on your future. Not good.\nSure, quit a certain skill because you saw an opportunity. Your initial skill isn\u2019t going to go away, especially if you will still use it in your next venture.\nKnowledge compounds, skills compound, good habits in general compound.\nThis is why I am a fan of a personal brand and one-person business. Your interests change. Your skills, knowledge, experience, awareness, and network compounds. You are a human. Humans evolve. Your business evolves with you if you follow this path. In fact, it is the vessel for accelerated evolution.\nDon\u2019t quit, pivot.\n6) Copy Your Way To Success\nSuccess is a game of intelligent imitation.\nDon\u2019t act like you haven\u2019t copied everything around you since you were born, just to think you are \u201coriginal,\u201d clever, or witty.\nYou very well may be, but the self can only exist in relation to other. Who you think you are is just a mental construction from the environments, stimuli, and conditioning you\u2019ve been exposed to over your life.\nImitation is the greatest skill any beginner can follow, like you\u2019re a blank-slate child that just got birthed into the life of business.\nPractice writing in your favorite author\u2019s voice\nUse the topic your favorite account posted as inspiration\nSwipe the problems that your competitor targets in their landing page\nDeconstruct why certain posts go viral and whether or not it brought in money\nLook at what everyone is selling (meaning it sells) and think about how you can create your own with your unique experience\nRead about an idea that excites you, don\u2019t highlight, and write it without looking at the text. Make it your own by recalling what you learned from memory\nBefore I go on more of a philosophical rant, let\u2019s get back to business.\n7) The Most Profitable Niche Is You\nTraditional branding, marketing, and sales advice are coming to an end. We\u2019ve explored that crevice of reality and made distinctions between the good and bad.\nPushy sales funnels and robotic writing work, but they work less than they used to.\nIf you want to get ahead of the curve, productize yourself.\nUnderstand yourself through self-reflection and the Myers Briggs personality test.\nThen, treat YOU as your customer avatar.\nPursue your goals, study your interests, and write to your past, present, and future self online.\nNobody can replicate authenticity.\nThere is only one you, if you aren\u2019t a slave to the external. You are what you say you are, not what other people say you are.\n8) Self-Awareness Is Key\nSelf-awareness (or self-consciousness, in the positive sense) will help you learn most skills faster than anyone else.\nIf you\u2019re a creator, personal brand, or other form of solopreneur, you understand the necessity of consistent high-quality content.\nThat means you have to master human behavior and psychology.\nIn this case, you are your best teacher.\nWhy did that thread capture my attention?\nWhy did I like and retweet it?\nThink about it, you want people to do those same things to you.\nSo rather than scrolling past as we mindlessly do\u2026\nStop, pause, and reverse engineer\nSame with making money.\nIf you want to make money, understand why you spend money.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) April 28, 2022\n9) Start, Then Learn\nInformation is abundant.\nThe massive mistake that people make in the age of information is letting knowledge outpace execution.\nYes, you can learn anything, but are you learning anything?\nThe best way to go about this is by outlining a project.\nOutline a newsletter\nOutline a product\nOutline a service\nOutline your life\nThen, start.\nYour mind will be primed for pattern recognition. Your quality of life will shoot through the roof because you have a project to apply what you learn, experience, and consume as you go about your days.\nCreate a project, then seek the specific knowledge necessary to actualize that project. Don\u2019t get trapped in tutorial hell.\n10) Create Your Own Career\n60% of new jobs haven\u2019t been created yet.\nMeaning, we have no idea what they are going to be.\nWhat we do know is that they are on the internet.\nValue creators are creating new jobs left and right.\nThe internet allows people to pursue new goals, meaning there are new paths to take in life, meaning there are more problems to solve.\nThe education industry can\u2019t keep up, so value creators pave the way and distill their learnings in the form of content, courses, and other forms of educational media.\nI\u2019ve seen music production teachers, therapeutic herb specialists, confidence coaches, and even biohacking coaches (for performance-enhancing dr*gs of the mind, body, and spirit\u2026 like psychedelics).\nHow do you create your own career?\nBy pursuing your own broad interests, turning them into their own category, and solving problems with them.\nIf you are interested in mindset, productivity, and business\u2026 that can all fall under the \u201cniche\u201d of lifestyle design, personal sovereignty, or something else. Then, you create the meaning, theory, and philosophy behind that new category.\nMine is one-person businesses. I tie in spirituality with you being a divine \u201ccreator\u201d and form my own way of viewing this through my personal experience.\n11) Lack Of Experience Isn\u2019t An Excuse\nIt\u2019s incredible what kind of mental gymnastics the ego will go through to convince you what you can\u2019t do.\nIf I tell you to start writing online and the 20+ life and business benefits that come from it, how does your mind object?\n\u201cI\u2019m not good at writing.\u201d\n\u201cOnly influencers can grow an audience.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just freelancing before I build an audience.\u201d\nWhile all of these are dumb and more false than true, the last one is a little too silly.\nYou\u2019re telling me you don\u2019t want to give out free information (because you are inexperienced), but you are going to do free or paid work for someone\u2019s business where there is revenue on the line? How do you justify that to yourself?\nWriting is how you clarify your thoughts. Writing is how you clarify what you know. Writing is how you open up the potential to come up with a real (not copied) solution that you can sell for more money.\nLearn the skill, use the skill (on yourself, because a personal brand requires every skill that a business would need), teach what you learn, then sell it.\nDo the opposite of everyone else.\nEveryone is just leaving out the pieces of the full picture that would lead them to action.\nDon\u2019t let fear rule you and keep you the same.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nP.S. Digital Economics starts in 4 days.\nIf you want a complete Notion dashboard for starting, growing, and scaling your one-person business, consider enrolling.\nWe will work together to create a unique brand, authentic voice, untapped niche, and product or service that actually sells (from the start of your journey)."

        "heading": "The Rise Of The Value Creator (A New Career Path)",
        "content": "The state of work is changing.\nThings are going digital, we know that.\nEmployers are hiring based on the content you share online, your public resume, we know that.\nPeople are losing trust in traditional education while resorting to internet creators to teach them the necessary skills for personal & professional success, we know that.\nOnline courses get a bad rap.\n\nThe truth is, we need MORE to educate people on modern skills people can actually use in the information age.\n\nA 19th-century education system built for the industrial age won't cut it.\n\nDecentralized value creators are the answer.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 15, 2022\nClient work (like freelancing) is everyone\u2019s first option. One, because they aren\u2019t aware of another low-startup-cost opportunity. Two, because everyone screams to \u201clearn a skill, sell a skill\u201d and it\u2019s conditioned into their brain. This usually backfires when they realize they\u2019ve built themselves into another 9-5 with a capped income. Labor cannot be scaled as a one-person business.\nEven then, there is one thing that a lot of people glance over. The current state of freelancing is 90% composed of people using software to manage aspects of people\u2019s businesses.\nWeb designers use templates and website builders. Email marketers use writing templates and automation. While this may make money in the short term, it will not be sustainable over the next few years as tech continues to rapidly evolve (while putting the power back into the individual\u2019s hands).\nThe highest-paid freelancers don\u2019t get paid for this. They get paid for how they use the tools with the value they\u2019ve developed in their mind. They have specific knowledge that allows them to use software in creative ways that get extraordinary results.\nSure, some people can schedule posts on Instagram and pay for a software that helps with growth (like interacting with other accounts), but if your content sucks? If your funnel sucks? If your offer sucks? You aren\u2019t gonna make it. Intellectual development is increasing in importance as we transcend the material.\nThis has been a long time coming.\nAs humans, we\u2019ve built tools, solutions, and technology that make our lives easier. The plow made farming easier. Shoes made urban living easier. Software made business easier \u2013 automations have replaced an immense amount of labor jobs and will not stop until the laziness of human nature makes physical life easy. And yes, these do all come with consequences, but who are you to judge how the cosmos chooses to evolve over a lifetime?\nThe next phase is to ideate, build, and earn with our mind to advance to the next stage of human evolution. What used to take thousands of dollars and a team of programmers can be built with a $10 subscription to a landing page-building software. Do not underestimate this power.\nIn the past few letters, we have discussed the one-person business model.\nThis one on how to productize yourself and this one how to find and profit from problems in your life.\nIn this letter, I want to introduce you to what I call a Value Creator.\nA new career path for the intellectually curious that don\u2019t want to turn into the stereotypical internet marketer. A career path for those that value independence, self-reliance, and having full control over how much you make, how much you work, and what you work on.\nIn short, Value Creators are those that:\nEarn with their mind, not their time (so they can stay as a one-person business without limiting their income).\nResearch their obsessions and distill their learnings with writing, video, and other internet content.\nGet paid for aggregated knowledge and experience in the form of digital products (or physical products if you want, but everyone should have some form of digital product).\nHave a heavy focus on educating their audience (instead of posting memes, starting drama, or other things like that).\nValue creators are those that dedicate themselves to their interests, take it on as their life\u2019s work to explore them, and distill the information in the form of education.\nWhy does this matter? Because we need passionate individuals to become experts in their respective domain of mastery. Who else is going to do it? Will the government (that is intimately tied with the school system) nurture a curriculum as technology phases out an entire segment of work? No, they\u2019re going to be the first to build the technology that does it, so they can have more money.\nLastly, the \u201cvalue\u201d space in the creator economy is so small. Everyone is focused on flashy gimmicks and cheap entertainment. We need individuals that can educate in an exciting way for the coming generations \u2013 because school curriculum won\u2019t be able to keep up with niche advancements.\nExploring An Unknown Crevice Of Reality Through Obsession\nIt\u2019s not about transitioning from consumer to creator.\nIt\u2019s about transitioning from consumer to researcher.\nBeing a \u201cconsumer\u201d implies mindless consumption of information.\nBeing a \u201cresearcher\u201d implies intentional consumption of information.\nA value creator earns with his mind, not his time. Meaning, his greatest asset is information, ideas, and knowledge that gets you excited to wake up and share the discoveries that came from your research.\nIf you follow my notion of the one-person business model (monetizing yourself), the person you can help the most is you.\nYour niche is you.\nYour brand, content, and offer are all based on your goals, interests, and personal experience.\nThis is a holistic approach to doing what you love for a living. You are opening up the potential to be paid for becoming a high-value individual by becoming an expert in a select domain of the interests you are obsessed over. Why would you want to create a business out of anything else? Business was, should, and return to being an extension of the self.\nThat all sounds great, but how do you research effectively?\nBy exploring the unknown aspects of reality through consciousness. You see, reality is infinitely complex, connected, and perspective based.\nWhile most people navigate life on the surface, those that can dive deep beyond what they see are the ones that unlock the creative potential that others can\u2019t fathom.\nIn Digital Economics, I talk about business being a vessel for self-actualization. Digging deep into the interests that you love researching is how you learn about yourself, life, and the people you plan to serve with your findings. Business, to me, is a medium for making the impractical practical. It is a way of adding intention and utility to everything that goes into your brain.\nBut how do you explore this crevice of reality?\nBy deconstructing wholes into parts. (Then, you reconstruct those parts into a new whole, that is creativity.) That\u2019s what every single thing in this world is. A unit of thought. A figment of consciousness. A thing. Both a whole and a part. Atom, molecule, cell, organism. All parts of a whole and wholes in themselves. Human, bedroom, apartment complex, city, state, country, planet, galaxy. Everything is infinitely connected in all directions. Up, down, left, and right. This is what consciousness is. Seeing beyond what\u2019s right in front of your eyes. This requires accurate perception of reality itself. The more closed-minded, reactionary, and quick-to-judge you are, the less likely you are to succeed in this space (or any space for that matter).\nConscious Entrepreneurship is how you become a Value Creator.\nLet\u2019s make this a bit more practical.\n1) Choose An Obsession\nFirst, do not seek to outsource any of this. You have to adopt the mindset of an explorer. Nobody can tell you what you are obsessed with.\nIf you don\u2019t know, try. If you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll never know.\nTry everything.\nGo to a local bookstore and buy the book that \u201ccalls\u201d your name.\nNone of this \u201cearn with your mind\u201d stuff is step-by-step, predictable, or able to be described with words. You have to learn to trust your gut.\nIf you need a starting point:\nLook at your browser history\nLook at the videos you last watched\nLook at what you naturally consume to learn (FYI, distraction is not natural)\nLook at your life and see what area you have improved the most\nWhy would you not want to turn these things into a business so you can get paid for doing what you already do?\n\u201cSensible people get paid for doing what they enjoy doing.\u201d\n2) Research From All Angles\nOne big problem with creators is that they get sucked into an ideology that prevents them from being unique. They get a whiff of \u201ctruth\u201d and make it their entire brand (and identity). They aren\u2019t able to artfully navigate a persuasive argument because they believe their way is the only way.\nThe health and fitness industry is what comes to mind here.\nWhile most people are subscribed to a specific diet and training model (like carnivore and powerlifting) you have to understand that reality is composed of infinite angles. Infinite perspectives.\nPerspectives are goal based. An individual\u2019s goals are what determine whether or not specific advice is valuable to them. If you truly want to help people, you have to help them navigate your crevice of reality in accordance with their goals.\nOr, if you are using your goals as your brand, you speak on topics from that perspective. You research your interests to aid in your journey toward your goals \u2013 this is how you attract niche, like-minded followers.\nMeaning, you need to expose yourself with an open mind to all perspectives on the matter to begin forming your unique message.\nFollow people that you disagree with\nBuy a best selling book on the fundamentals\nBuy books that offer opposite insights (different diets, different religions, different mindset techniques)\nListen to more long form content than short form (because short content is crafted to get an emotional reaction out of you more than it is meant to educate you).\nMake it impossible for yourself to not see the full picture. In short, immerse yourself in your obsession.\nLearn about it everyday. Unfollow anyone that doesn\u2019t talk about it. Make a conscious effort to expose yourself to as much information as possible in that space that you choose. This will give you creative firepower.\n3) Note Down Ideas, Discoveries\nAs you are researching your obsessions and becoming an expert in that domain, it should be impossible not to note down interesting information.\nIf you need help, here\u2019s what to look for:\nIdeas, anecdotes, or experiences that you can use in the content you post or products you create (so you can hold attention and never run out of things to write)\n\u201cGolden nuggets\u201d of information that spark excitement in you (so you can spark that excitement in other people)\nNew ways of thinking about topics that you hadn\u2019t thought about before (so you can change how others view the topic)\nUnderstand that this won\u2019t mean anything to you unless you are actively researching your obsessions.\nBy following those 3 steps, you have successfully begun to deconstruct the \u201cwhole\u201d of your interests into its \u201cparts.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what you do next (important).\nSimplifying Complex Topics Will Be The Greatest Skill Of The Next Century\nThis is where most people in the self-help space stop. They horde valuable information and close themselves off from true learning.\nYou have to apply what you learn.\nYou don\u2019t learn how to write by reading about writing.\nYou don\u2019t learn how to balance on a bike by reading a course on riding a bike.\nBut, with value or knowledge creation, you don\u2019t apply what you learn in a physical sense. You must contemplate, think, and write to form a cohesive message that is actually valuable.\nThe next step is absolutely crucial:\nPut your creations, writing, and content on the public market so you can get direct feedback on your work. You have to attract an audience. My favorite way of doing that is social media, of course.\nThe teacher learns more than the student, and building an audience gives you leverage, traffic, and a community that will set you up for life.\nNow, we could talk about audience building all day long, but you may be wondering, \u201ccan everyone build an audience?\u201d Let\u2019s run through it real quick:\nEvery single person on social media follows 400-1000+ people. Yes, even creators.\nDon\u2019t forget the network affect, all of those 400-1000 people also follow that many people, and so do those people. Your audience is not just however many people follow you.\nAll you need are 1000 true fans and a good offer stack to pull in 6+ figures.\nI could handle this objection all day\u2026 in short, if you think the market is saturated, you\u2019re incredibly wrong (you wouldn\u2019t be thinking this if you\u2019ve been doing it for 3-6 months).\nValue creation allows you to apply anything you learn. The essence (or lesson) from your everyday experiences can be used as firepower for compelling writing, videos, or even a product \u2013 similar to how I didn\u2019t like any planners I bought, so I created my own to sell through an audience I built by talking about my interests.\nHowever, you have to understand that others aren\u2019t going to be interested in what you have to say. That makes most people want to quit.\nYou have to package up your findings in a way that others perceive as valuable and distribute them as a one-person media company.\nOne-person diversified media companies are the new modern business.\n\nGrow a social channel, build a large email list, and then offer multiple products at multiple price points:\n\n\u2013 Subscriptions\n\u2013 Sponsorships\n\u2013 Coaching\n\u2013 Affiliates\n\u2013 Courses\n\u2013 Etc.\n\nTiny business. Big revenue.\n\u2014 Justin Welsh (@thejustinwelsh) October 2, 2022\nThe internet is code and media.\nMedia is how you distribute your value, code is what allows the media to be there. With a one-person business, you can pay for no-code software and focus all of your efforts on distributing valuable media.\nLet\u2019s make this practical.\nHow do you package up the knowledge you gain in a valuable way?\n1) Choose A Media Platform\nI prefer Twitter.\nYou can post as much as you\u2019d like (to test your ideas before you post them on other platforms).\nIt\u2019s writing based, meaning you don\u2019t need to be a 10/10 model living in Thailand sipping coconuts on the beach.\nIt is like a forum, you can find people much quicker.\nThe retweet button is a low-friction share feature, that\u2019s how you gain followers (other platforms are harder to grow on as a beginner)\nYou can just screenshot your tweets to grow on other platforms (this is what everyone else is doing).\nThe basics of growing on Twitter are simple.\nPost 1-3 times a day (and start getting your \u201cfailures\u201d out of the way)\nIf you are under 1000 followers, focus on networking with other people in the replies and DMs to leverage their audience\nHave a clickable profile picture so people know you are a creator\nUse your big goal in life OR the 3 interests you talk about as your bio (what are you leading people towards and how will they get their through your unique interests?)\nWrite threads based on your story and personal experience (but make sure you have a network that will share it so it goes semi viral)\nStart with beginner level educational content. Make it actionable. That\u2019s what everyone does to grow at the start (on any platform) and 95% of the market are beginners. Don\u2019t try to be super clever or wise until you build a name for yourself.\n2) Learn To Capture Attention\nAttention is the currency of the 21st century.\nBut don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to become a sleazy salesman to join in on the social media party.\nEntrepreneurship is about finding your unique balance between art and marketing.\n\nIf you swing too far to the \"art\" side, you end up a starving artist.\n\nIf you swing too far to the \"marketing\" side, you end up a sleazy salesman.\n\nYou can't neglect one or the other.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 14, 2022\nThis is a matter of looks VS depth. Dopamine VS the \u201chere and now\u201d neurotransmitters like serotonin and oxytocin.\nYou must capture attention and then deliver the value you promised to give that attention. Nobody wants to be perceived as a scammer, clickbait conman, or shallow platitude slinger. We will fix that in step 4.\nIn Digital Economics, we dive deep into the psychology of capturing attention, but here are a few principles so you can start now.\nProblems \u2013 every good story captures attention by starting with a problem that the reader is facing. It opens a curiosity loop and makes them want to find the solution. Problems are at the root of human behavior.\nNumbers \u2013 specific numbers are a pattern interrupt when you are scrolling on social media. \u201cI read 347 self-help books so you don\u2019t have to\u201d is an example.\nStatistics \u2013 similar to numbers, statistics set the scene quite nicely. \u201c97% of the population has seen a decline in focus, here\u2019s how to fix yours\u201d is an example that could use a bit of work, but you see the power in it.\nIf you want to learn the art of capturing attention, start immersing yourself in headlines, Twitter thread hooks, and other social media posts in general. Fill your subconscious with creative firepower, then go on a walk and let ideas flood your conscious mind (have your note capture system ready \ud83d\ude42\nStart researching instead of consuming. Deconstruct why people\u2019s posts are working rather than just scrolling by them mindlessly.\nThis is the best hack I could give you.\nConsciousness.\n3) Treat Yourself As Your Ideal Reader\nWhen someone is building a readership or audience for the value they are creating, common advice is to write to your ideal customer.\nWith the one-person business, you are your niche. You are your customer avatar. You are your brand, content, and product.\nI have people go through the Myers-Briggs personality test in Digital Economics so they can understand themselves more. When you understand yourself, you can write to yourself. The test results are your customer avatar.\nNow, what do you write?\nIf you are going through a tough time, give yourself advice and write it online in your \u201cpublic journal\u201d\nGive your past self advice on overcoming the problems you faced, but faster\nGive your future self-encouragement to achieve the goals you are trying to achieve.\nThese are just a few of the many ways you can create content, but they are a great (and accessible) starting point.\n4) Prioritize Depth And Clarity\nEvery single Sunday, I outline my newsletter for the week.\nThis newsletter is used as a YouTube script (I literally just read the post from my phone to the camera and edit out the pauses).\nAfter that, I can condense the main points into a Twitter thread, Instagram carousel or caption, LinkedIn post, and more.\nI can also skim through the newsletter to generate Tweet ideas, which then get crossposted to every platform (if you follow me, you see this every day\u2026 but are you conscious of it?). I also read my best tweets to the camera for reels, shorts, and TikToks.\nWhy start with the newsletter?\nBecause of depth.\nDepth is how you build authority.\nIf you are a value creator, I can tell you right now that only writing short form content will lead to pain and a lack of authority. Sure, it works for ecommerce brands that are going for quick cash\u2026 but if you want to do something that you don\u2019t think is monetizable (like spirituality)? Depth is not an option. It is a priority and the only way you can monetize effectively.\nBy outlining my newsletter at the start of every week, I give myself one big idea that I can munch on when I\u2019m on a walk, at the gym, or other forms of \u201crest\u201d that activate the Default Mode Network in my brain (the key to creativity).\nWhenever an idea pops into my head, I open up my outline on my phone and write it down. This makes it seamless to never have writer\u2019s block.\nHow do you write a newsletter?\nChoose a high-performing topic based on your tweets or other content that you know will do well (like your favorite YouTuber\u2019s most popular video).\nStart with a personal experience or story that illustrates the problem you faced relating to that topic.\nGive actionable steps to overcoming that problem.\nThat\u2019s all you need to start with, you can get fancy or go longer if you want. I write long newsletters because I love it. The mental benefits spill over far beyond business.\nWith all of that said, Digital Economics starts in a little over a week.\nI have an entire Notion dashboard with systems for everything we\u2019ve just discussed (and more) so you can manage your entire one-person business in 2-4 hours a day.\nHere is 30% of what\u2019s inside the Notion dashboard (each of these contains systems to make business easy on you):\nIn 60 days, we master one-person branding, content creation, creating your offer (regardless of experience), and craft a marketing strategy so you can start monetizing immediately.\nI\u2019ve iterated on this curriculum for 3 years. The information gets results, is time tested, and breaks you out of the creator rat race.\nIf you\u2019re interested, read more here and consider enrolling.\nWe start on the 26th!\nLastly, thank you for reading this weeks letter. I hope you got a lot out of it.\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "content": "Work less. Earn more. Enjoy life.\nThat\u2019s my motto.\nSuccess is counterintuitive, and living by this motto has led to the most growth in my life.\nWorking less for the sake of rest and recovery leads to higher-quality work.\nEarning more is subjective, but I believe anyone can earn more than enough to do whatever they want.\nLife enjoyment is usually the byproduct of both. With enough free time, capital, and a business network you can do almost anything you want in this life.\nBut, don\u2019t worry, I also fell into the trap of wanting to live the life of someone else.\nBeachfront views.\nSand in the toes.\nTanned like Hasslehoff.\nCoconuts served with a straw for those sweet sweet electrolytes to top off the tropical vibes.\nThat was, until I experienced it.\nIt started off awesome, as the dopamine treadmill goes, but once you possess it, that lifestyle quickly loses it\u2019s shine (unless you swap the neurotransmitters fueling your well-being through appreciation, gratitude, and present moment awareness).\nThe crappy Wi-Fi connection got old.\nThe partying and language barrier got old.\nThe working from your laptop on the beach got extremely old.\nI mean, who actually wants to do that?\nDo you want to work in a place where you can\u2019t even see your screen because of the sun? Let alone overheat after 30 minutes and have to go back inside anyway?\nThe purpose of this letter is not to talk bad about the digital nomad lifestyle. I\u2019m leaving out the positive side of the coin to paint a picture here. See if its the right lifestyle for you.\n\u201cAs with everything, it\u2019s useful in moderation.\u201d\nAs Watts would say.\nI\u2019m here to talk about just that.\nModeration.\nSustainability.\nA business model that allows you to create your ideal lifestyle through practice, experimentation, and iteration.\nA way to make a creative income source with skills, interests, and people you align with.\nA new path that is here to stay, but is still seen as \u201ctaboo\u201d because people are so tied to their beliefs and comfortable ways of living.\nThanks to the internet, clash of ideas, and solutions that have been built over the years \u2014 anyone can increase their value through self-education, turn themselves into a brand, and have opportunities coming to them.\nAsk your parents if they could build a website, upload a product, and accept payment with $10-$20 and some self-education.\nSeriously, go ask them. Then tell me why you still hold the belief that you need X, Y, and Z to start a business. Those aren\u2019t excuses anymore.\nDo you perceive this as an opportunity or \u201cjust something that people more successful than me do\u201d?\nTo top it off, you can start right now.\nNot in 1 year when your skills are perfect.\nRight now.\nIf you are reading this letter, I\u2019m assuming you are 18-35 years old (with some outliers, I see you ;))\nMeaning, you have 18-35+ years of unique experience.\nThe problem?\nYou do not see the value in that experience. You think your life is boring\u2026 or at least too boring to be able to profit off of being yourself. Which is funny, because there are hundreds of thousands of people that would love to hear why you do what you do, they won\u2019t think it\u2019s boring.\nFrom my experience, the highest-paid individuals are not the ones that bank on their body or flashy lifestyle to earn an income.\nPeople of depth and value are the ones that get paid the most. They aren\u2019t one-dimensional. They train their mind just as much as their body. They are the generalists that hire the specialists \u2014 and the specialists, 90% of the time, are going to be the robots that were designed to take on repetitive tasks. Automations, no-code tools, and software that weren\u2019t a thing 10 years ago.\nA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. \u2014Robert A. Heinlein\nEven more of a problem (than not seeing in the value in your personal experience):\nYou don\u2019t know how to communicate your experiences in a way that people can find the value in.\nThat\u2019s all anyone is doing on social media.\nEffective communication.\nSome are more fake than others, but that\u2019s their problem. Not yours or mine.\nIt\u2019s not about being interesting, it\u2019s about learning what makes your words interesting to the other person.\nWhat Is The One Person Business Model?\nThe one-person business model has always appealed to me over having many employees.\n\nA simple website as a \"storefront\"\n\nA digital product stack with high-profit margins\n\n4 hour work days and potential $1M years\n\nControl over what you work on and who you work with.\n\nHard to beat.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) July 4, 2022\nThe one person business, in my eyes, is for those that value self-reliance, time freedom, and location freedom.\nWe use:\nSocial media for building leverage, attracting like-minds, and building a name for ourself (from nothing)\nNo-code tools and software for digital real estate, product hosting, and email lists (that can\u2019t be taken away like social media)\nLifestyle design to create a work schedule that best suits the individual \u2013 usually 2-4 hours of work a day at the start, sometimes more if you get into the flow\nIt is an incredible time to be alive.\nThe internet has given everyone the ability to become an entrepreneur, choose their working hours, and earn an income based around their obsessions.\nNo two people are going to be obsessed with the same crevice of reality. And as you evolve and experience more, no two people are going to be obsessed with the crevice of reality that they gained awareness of (through action and doing).\nThere is no saturation\u2026 when done correctly.\nThe one-person business model is the best option for 95% of people, especially if you are just starting out. Every single billion-dollar founder started their entrepreneurial journey with 2 things \u2013 an idea and themselves. They didn\u2019t just start with a billion-dollar company, but we tend to believe what we see and limit our mind from diving beyond the surface.\nWhy do people fail with their one-person business?\nThere are quite a few reasons:\nYou don\u2019t believe it is possible or that you don\u2019t have enough experience\nYou don\u2019t realize that every aspect of your business is a skill that needs to be improved (you will suck at the beginning)\nYou don\u2019t listen to feedback or understand how to pivot how you talk about things (if your knowledge isn\u2019t interesting, you have to make it interesting by learning how to think)\nYou lose momentum because you try to overcomplicate your message to seem unique, intelligent, and over the top\nThe list goes on. The lesson is that you must value self-reliance. You have to take matters into your own hands and understand that nobody is going to give you a paycheck every Friday. You must learn to hunt.\n2 Paths To Start A One-Person Business With Zero Experience\nThe biggest killer is that people don\u2019t believe that business is for them, or that they don\u2019t have enough experience.\nFirst, stop thinking of business as anything more than an exchange of value. You get something useful, I get something useful. If you want to truly make a dent in a world that revolves around money, drop your noble charity act. Acting selfless to feel good about yourself is just another version of selfishness.\nIf you\u2019ve helped your friends or family with any topic that you\u2019ve ever learned about in your life, you have enough experience.\nEven more, how do you think you gain experience?\nI\u2019ll tell you one thing, you don\u2019t gain experience without stepping into the arena. You gain experience by practicing your skills in a real-world setting.\nIf a freelancer can reach out to clients with zero experience (to gain experience) in exchange for money, why can\u2019t you post something valuable online without expecting anything in return?\nMake it make sense.\nYour imposter syndrome is self-deception.\nHere are the 2 paths you can take:\nPath 1) Skill Based\nThis is the most common route that people tell you to take.\nLearn a skill\nTeach the skill\nSell the skill\nThis is great, but as I said, you don\u2019t want to end up one-dimensional. You don\u2019t want to be a slave to client work that can\u2019t be scaled. You don\u2019t want to pursue something else with absolutely nothing to show for it. It happens all the time. Freelancers earn an income through cold email and referrals, and when human nature kicks into play and you want to change direction, you are starting from scratch all over again.\nBuild an audience of diverse, yet connected interests.\nPath 2) Development Based\nThis second route is more my speed.\nIt\u2019s based around the 4 eternal markets.\nThe 4 eternal markets are where burning, profitable problems exist. They are where people have lofty goals that you can help them achieve.\nHealth\nWealth\nRelationships\nHappiness\nPath 1 only pays attention to wealth. Marketable skills to help people make more money. By default, you build a one-dimensional brand.\nWith path 2, you quite literally pursue your own goals in life (brand), solve your problems as you are pursuing those goals (content), and create a system to help others do the same (offer).\nThat is how you be yourself, improve yourself, and profit off of yourself.\n\u201cBut Dan, I\u2019m just starting out!\u201d\nAnd?\nIt\u2019s not like you have to write content on \u201cHow I made 1 million dollars in 3 days.\u201d Less and less people care about that nowadays. They register it as a scam in their mind.\nBranding and content are all about perspective. Or \u201cpositioning\u201d in marketing. All you have to do is be honest.\nWhat is going to perform better?\n\u201cHow I made 1 million dollars in 3 days\u201d\nOr\n\u201cHow I plan to make 1 million dollars in 5 years\u201d\nWhich one would you click on? Which would you follow? Which would you believe and implement for yourself?\nSelf-awareness and behavior change are the great determinants of your brand\u2019s success. Are you aware of how YOU would view your brand or content as an outsider? Are you putting out content that will actually change people\u2019s lives?\nPath 3) Both\nWhen you start a one-person business, it is on you to learn the skills necessary to make it work.\nYou will have to learn how to create a compelling profile photo, banner, designs, persuasive bio and content, landing page, and other software that others don\u2019t know how to use.\nAnd of course, writing, which is the foundational skill for any business success (that I teach in 2 Hour Writer)\nAs you talk about your journey towards achieving your goals, you will be learning skills (through direct real-world experience) by building your brand.\nThen, you will have skills that you can sell to help other brands if you don\u2019t already have an offer in mind.\nJose Rosado, as an example, made a full time income selling profile banners, then transitioned into web design and made multiple 6 figures. Then transitioned again into digital products. The one person business model favors your personal evolution. That\u2019s what makes you unique from everyone else.\nIf you don\u2019t see the opportunity, it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t in the arena. The opportunities can\u2019t register in your awareness because you haven\u2019t even stepped through the door.\nThe 4 Pillars Of A One Person Business\nFor those that want to do what they want and help the people they can help the most \u2013 traditional branding, marketing, content, and offer creation will lead you in the wrong direction.\nThe personal brand is the most powerful storefront in our times. It builds a human connection.\nThe traditional business model will have you create a customer avatar based on someone with a profitable problem you can solve.\nMy way, The Experience Model, turns YOU into the customer avatar.\nThat way, you can solve your own problems, attract people that are on a similar path as you, and help them do the same.\nAnother bonus, you don\u2019t have to spend countless hours doing market research to understand what will sell.\nAll you have to do is become obsessed with achieving a goal, solve problems that arise, and create a system to help others do it faster.\nA system is just a step-by-step method for how you would go back and solve that problem quick.\nLike climbing the stairs to the first floor and sending an elevator down to help someone up.\nYou will find the best results helping people 1 level under you (and you will learn the most from the same, your awareness level needs to be able to register all of the teachings).\nPillar 1) Branding\nIn business, stop trying to find a \u201cproblem\u201d to solve.\n\nInstead, understand the \u201cgoal\u201d that people are trying to achieve.\n\nThen, become an expert at solving the problems that prevent people from achieving that goal.\n\nHelp them get there as fast as possible. That\u2019s what they want.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 3, 2022\nYour brand is who you are, what you do, and what you are doing.\nWhat goal are you working towards?\nWhy are you working towards it? What is the desired outcome that you are trying to achieve? That is what people are going to follow you for.\nThe thing about branding is that it doesn\u2019t have to be directly stated in many places. Maybe on your website where you can explain your brand message, but aside from that \u2013 people will pick up what your brand message is through your content.\nPillar 2) Content\nBeginners need to understand this:\nYour brand (especially on social media) is formed through 1-3 months of content.\nContent compounds. And I don\u2019t mean in terms of views or reach. I mean the message compounds in people\u2019s minds until your entire message *clicks.*\nPeople aren\u2019t going to understand you from one tweet, video, or article alone.\nYou need TIME in the game if you want to have a shred of authority.\nNow, what do you write about?\nYou write about the interests, skills, and topics that you plan to master. The ones that will help you achieve your goals in a way that is unique to you.\nRemember the tweet from above? The one about not finding a problem, but setting a goal?\nAll content (and human attention / behavior in general) revolves around problems. Problems are the starting point of your content, but you and your followers must be working to similar goals for those problems to be relevant.\nEveryone can have the same goal of \u201cliving the good life,\u201d but how are YOU going to make that a reality?\nFor me, it is by studying the human mind, philosophy, and creative work.\nFor another person, it could be web design, mindset, and fitness.\nAnd another, it could be automation, marketing, and productivity.\nIf you put 5 people at the bottom of a mountain and asked how they would get to the top, they would all draw a different path.\nThe unique combination of these topics IS your niche.\nThey are broad because we want to build a large, leverageable, and flexible audience \u2013 rather than put ourselves in a box and be limited in what we talk about.\nIf I ever wanted to pivot into fitness, turn my training regimen (that I\u2019ve experimented with for years) into a course, and sell it for an income, I could. I would market it to my audience (who has similar goals and interests as me) in a way that would appeal most to them.\nBut HOW do you write about these topics?\nIn Digital Economics, I teach about the Domain Of Mastery.\nYou choose 3 broad topics that you can then break down into principles, mentors for inspiration, and sub topics.\nThen, you can research books, podcasts, articles, and social posts to see how others are talking about those topics.\nThis is more than just business. This is how you get paid for improving yourself, learning how to think, and creating a meaningful life.\nUnderstand that this is just a starting point to get you moving forward. You will pivot when you become aware of something you truly want to do (because you weren\u2019t aware of it at the level you were at before).\nAt the beginning, your job is to emulate what works.\nYou need to build authority in the topics you talk about by writing beginner-level content that has guaranteed growth time and time again.\nGo look at your favorite YouTuber.\nDid they grow their audience at the start with cool little vlogs?\nOr did they make it their full-time job to educate their audience and teach them about new skills and interests?\nPillar 3) Offer\nNo, you don\u2019t have to wait to start monetizing. I\u2019m tired of hearing that sh*t. Gatekeeper mindset.\nYou need to start monetizing (charging low) ASAP.\nYou NEED something to iterate on. You need something to build, improve, and make more valuable.\nYour first offer WILL suck. There\u2019s no escaping it. You should get that first crappy iteration out immediately.\nYou can\u2019t improve something that doesn\u2019t exist.\nYou need to learn what it\u2019s like to sell. You need a real-world vessel to apply all of your marketing and sales learnings to.\n\u201cOkay Dan, but what do I sell?\u201d\nLet me introduce you to the Minimum Viable Offer.\nThe MVO is either a:\nSingle-skill freelance service that you can sell for $500-$1000\nSingle interest consulting service where you can sell a pack of 4 consult calls for $500-$1000\nI would almost always recommend option 2 if you are joining the creator economy. I would not start off with time-sucking client work that makes you feel like you don\u2019t have time to create content.\n(And, if you\u2019re anything like me, you like to learn and experiment for yourself. Most, not all, creators do. I don\u2019t like having work done for me).\nHealth, performance, mindset, and business consulting are a given.\nBut, you can still do this if you want to sell a skill as opposed to an interest. You would simply frame it as \u201ctutoring.\u201d\nYou can tutor or mentor people on how to build websites.\nYou can tutor or mentor people on how to write.\nYou can tutor or mentor people on how to start email marketing.\nWhat\u2019s the beauty in starting with an MVO, especially if it is a pack of 2-4 consulting calls?\n1) You can start monetizing immediately.\nNo need for a landing page if you understand the sales process. The ability to DM someone, a questionnaire software, and a calendar booking link is all you need. (And a way to send invoices of course).\nYou get on the calls, help people with their problems, and dedicate yourself to researching effective solutions for those problems. You don\u2019t need all of the answers at the start, you just need more time than the other person has. They don\u2019t have the time to solve the problem themselves. That\u2019s why they pay for your service anyway, speed, convenience, and accountability.\n2) You can build out a scalable product based on what gets results.\nTo increase the value of your consulting offer, you will be outlining a curriculum of sorts to help organize the structure of calls. You should also create things like worksheets and Notion dashboards to help your clients get more results.\nThese can be turned into a product that you can sell as your audience grows. The product buyers can lead into your consulting and become clients.\nThat means, less time spent on prospecting and more free time if you choose to decrease how many clients you take on (your prices will skyrocket too, of course.)\nPillar 4) Marketing\nLet\u2019s imagine you created your MVO.\nYou want to sell programming tutoring.\nNow, you need to build authority and trust in order to sell that service.\nSo, you write a weekly newsletter or thread based on a beginner-level programming topic (so that it can reach more people, 90% of the market are beginners).\nYou network with others in the programming space to get eyes on your content with their audience.\nIf you plug your service at the bottom of a thread and get 100,000+ impressions (on the LOW end) on your thread, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to land your first client.\nBoom, with the right strategy and not listening to the limiting beliefs in your head, you just made a third of the average salary. If you do this on a weekly basis, within 3 months you can outearn most salaries.\nUnlike freelancers, you are building an audience along the way as well. Your content and promotions are not going to waste. You have future potential to sell new things as you grow.\nThe point being, you need to promote yourself on a consistent basis.\nIf you don\u2019t promote your offer, you aren\u2019t going to make money.\nSimple as that.\nWith all of that said, Digital Economics is open for enrollment.\nI give you plug and play systems to create an effective brand, content, offer, and marketing with the skills, interests, and expertise you have right now.\nIt\u2019s a holistic masterclass with a complete Notion dashboard (that will run your business), accelerator recordings, and a Discord community for personalized help as you are building your business.\nIf that interests you, and you\u2019re ready to finally build something that gives you the time / location freedom you crave, consider enrolling.\nSee if it\u2019s a fit for you here.\n\u2013 Dan \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d Koe"

        "content": "Problems are not personal.\nProblems are systemic.\nEveryone has the same problems, and they will continue having the same problems.\nYou will never escape them.\nYou can only get better at how you perceive them, which leads to better decision-making (without being impacted by emotion).\nIn this letter, I want to bring a new perspective to problems in a way that helps you think, do, and be better.\nAnxiety, overwhelm, and stress are the result of psychic entropy.\nWhat is psychic entropy?\nPsychic = of the mind.\nEntropy = systems tending toward disorder.\nSystems need consistent energy to thrive.\nIf your mind is a room, and you don\u2019t put energy toward cleaning that room (maintaining order), then the room will get dirty.\nOne day without cleaning won\u2019t be bad. But after a week? A month? A year? That, my friends, is what we call a pig sty.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that anxiety is rampant in our society. Nobody has cleaned their room for a year, and who wants to put in that much more energy? It\u2019s much easier to clean your room after a day than it is after a year. The anxiety cycle continues because we know we need to clean our room, but we don\u2019t. There is a gap between thought and action.\nThat is exactly where problems occur.\nWhen there is a blockage of energy in the system that is our mind.\nMental health is about making sense, understanding, and clarity.\nIf you let a compulsive and negative thought hijack a situation, you can\u2019t see that situation for what it is.\nYou get stuck in your head, thinking about the bad things that could happen. You pull that negative experience into the now and it influences your thoughts and actions.\nAttention breathes life into everything it touches.\nWhen you give your attention to a false reality that your mind creates, you act in a way that makes it real.\nDo you think this will lead to beneficial outcomes in any situation?\nWill it help your social, financial, or personal goals? Or will it distort them in a way that makes you retreat into comfort?\nThe Lesson\nUnderstand that your problems are normal.\nThey are fabrications of the mind that are made real through attention.\nProblems aren\u2019t special, and when put into perspective, they become stupid.\nWhy are you worried about your social media post getting zero engagement when a child in a 3rd world country has come to accept that he may not have water tomorrow? How is that child in a better mental space than you?\nBy gaining perspective, you create the space to zoom out from the problem that has engulfed your attention. The problem shrinks from the size of the world to the size of a bread crumb.\nYou can see the problem for what it is, and through awareness, start correcting how you expend energy in your life to maintain mental order.\nOperate Within Your Own Reality\nHow do you maintain order in your mind to avoid the dreaded anxiety, overwhelm, and stress?\nBy creating your own reality.\nWhat the f*ck does that even mean, Dan?\nSystems need energy.\nYour mind is a system.\nMental energy is transferred through attention.\n\u201cWhere attention goes, energy flows.\u201d\nWhen you pay attention to the positive, life is positive.\nWhen you pay attention to the negative, life is negative.\nWhile this can be changed in an instant, you have to understand that you are a product of your past.\nYour mind started as a near blank slate. Over time, it was conditioned to operate in a way that is conducive to the progress of society and culture. There isn\u2019t a way around this. It is how you learn.\nWe adopt the beliefs of our parents, the mannerisms of our friends, and the problems of our culture as if they are our own.\nAgain, this isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d per se. But if you want more out of life (why else are you reading this newsletter?) then I can see you shaking your head left and right.\nIt\u2019s a common saying that \u201cyour thoughts create your reality,\u201d and they do, but what makes your thoughts (your reality) good or bad?\nIf our beliefs are programmed into our mind, and our beliefs tend to automate our thoughts, what do we do then? Do we just accept what we have been taught and the emotional baggage that comes along with that?\nLiving in a reality that you were conditioned into is like being a puppet. An NPC. An emotional light switch at the control of anyone except for yourself.\nTo reverse this effect, we must take control of the faculties we have full control over:\nYour perspective \u2014 the angle or position you are observing a situation.\nYour perception \u2014 how you interpret the situation. Is it problematic or beneficial?\nCombined, perspective + perception = focus.\nFocus = conscious attention.\nFocus can be controlled. Zoomed in, zoomed out, narrow, wide, open, closed.\nFocus is how you interact, interpret, and determine where you are going to place your precious energy.\nFocus is how you (and your mind) interacts with whatever external environment you are in.\nI am not talking about focus in the sense of deep work.\nI am talking about focus as the thing you are doing right now, for the entirety of your past, and the entirety of your future.\nDo not take this lightly.\nAttention is the only thing you can consciously control.\nAn uncontrollable thought pops into your head and you have 2 options:\n1) Let your attention be automatic and unconscious \u2014 which almost guarantees a negative interpretation of the thought, idea, or information that you are interpreting.\n2) Observe your attention, how you react, and course correct by interpreting the situation that is conducive to your goals, which we will discuss below.\nWhen we make this process conscious, focus, throughout our lifetime, our quality of life skyrockets. Why? Because we slowly begin to realize that everything we could ever want is achieved by how we invest the currency of focus. Investments compound.\nThe Cure To Anxiety: Always Act With Intention\nYour reality is a frame.\nPerspective is the camera, perception is the lens.\nWhen your attention is fully focused IN your reality, all of your worries dissipate.\nWe will discuss creating better relationships in another letter, but to keep it short: you create better relationships by finding a common perspective to share \u2014 a common reality where you can both give the most energy and solve problems that arise.\nThink about it, does a bodybuilder care if he brings chicken and rice to a family dinner? Yes, but only if he projects outside of his reality. That is, only if he loses control of his attention.\nIf he remembers what is important to him, his goals, and perceives the situation correctly to avoid short term pleasure, then he won\u2019t care. That is, he is focused.\nDoes anything else actually matter?\nYes, but only if you give it attention. It will literally only exist \u2014 be held in your conscious awareness \u2014 if you give it attention.\nIf you were unable to give it your attention, would it exist? Of course not, at least not to you.\nBring your attention back to your reality if a rogue thought, opinion, or belief pops into your field of awareness (which is determined by the wideness of your focus).\nIn short, to rid yourself of anxiety, caring what others think, and psychic entropy \u2014 you must master your focus.\nYou have to exchange robotic living for intentional living.\nFrom Latin intentio:\n\u2018stretching, purpose\u2019\nWhat are you stretching towards?\nCan you tell me? Are you doing it on a daily basis, or only when you \u201cfeel\u201d like it?\nIf you aren\u2019t pursuing a life of purpose \u2014 stretching toward something bigger than yourself \u2014 then you are surviving. An unconscious, mechanical, and automatic state of meaninglessness. A cog in the societal machine.\nFinally, how do we get out of this perpetual state of feeling lost, anxious, and having no sense of control over our lives?\nBy building, constructing, and actively creating the future that you want.\nPlease understand that these words are intentional.\nYou do not \u201cbuild\u201d a house in a day.\nYou do not \u201ccontruct\u201d a life without the resources to do so.\nYou may not even see the building emerge before the foundation has been laid. But once the skeleton of the house reveals itself, that is when motivation becomes automatic.\nHere\u2019s what you need to do:\n1) Set A Meaningful Goal\nThis is what trips most people up.\nA system needs an outcome.\nYou need to have something to put energy towards.\nIf you aren\u2019t making progress in any domain of your life (yes, even the spiritual domain by \u2018doing nothing\u2019 or taking some rest) then energy isn\u2019t flowing properly.\nMotivation comes from movement.\nPoorly contructed houses are destroyed, then rebuilt.\n\u201cBut Dan, how do I create a meaningful goal?\u201d\nFirst, don\u2019t hold false expectations about it being easy, immediate, or effortless.\nIf you don\u2019t know what to do, then the literal only option is to try new things. Nobody can tell you what is meaningful for you.\nTry that business model.\nLearn about that weird interest of yours.\nTake someones advice (that you respect) and experiment with it.\nDo ANYTHING that isn\u2019t scrolling on your phone and complaining about your situation in life.\nGiven time, you will find something that you want to go \u201call in\u201d on.\nHow do you know when it\u2019s time to go all in?\nYou won\u2019t be able to help yourself.\nIf you aren\u2019t living in a perpetual state of distraction, the excitement of that goal will propel you into action.\n2) Create A System\nIf you don\u2019t have a plan, don\u2019t expect results that aren\u2019t driven by luck.\nThe highest-paid individuals are the innovators, strategists, and visionaries of the world. Not the manual labor workers.\nBecome a strategist.\nSit down for 30 minutes tonight with a journal.\nDRAW out your future. Write exactly what you are going to do to get there.\nNow, understand that most goals are achieved with a system.\nA process.\nA process is repetitive, based on the fundamentals, and improved with experience.\nWhat levers are you going to move on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis?\nWrite it down.\nBecause then, and only then, can you work to improve that process.\nYou can\u2019t improve something that doesn\u2019t exist.\nSo create something that you can improve.\n3) Channel All Of Your Energy Toward That Goal\nEnergy comes in two forms, extrinsic and intrinsic.\nBy working toward a goal that excites you, you will be fueled by good dopamine, as dopamine comes from the desire to actualize your vision.\nThis is intrinsic energy. If you lose the initial excitement for your goal, you may need to remind yourself why you started in the first place.\nThe next form of energy, extrinsic, comes from channeling all of your thoughts, emotions, and actions toward that goal.\nReframe everything you encounter to be seen from the perspective of your goal.\nReframing = transmutation.\nThere are always 2 sides to the same coin. Positive and negative.\nMost people conveniently leave out the positive so they have an excuse to stop pursuing the goal.\nYou have to take control of your attention.\nThe best way to do this is by asking \u201cwhy\u201d in the context of intention.\nWhy are you eating that bland yet energizing food? To achieve your physique goals.\nWhy are you writing posts that will get zero traction at the start? To achieve your financial freedom goals.\nWhy are you talking to a new person even if you look \u201cout of place\u201d in public? To achieve your social goals.\nMental. Order.\nIf you don\u2019t have an answer to \u201cwhy\u201d you are doing what you are doing, then why are you doing it?\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense. Mental health is about making sense.\nI ask again:\nWhat are you stretching towards?\nThis alone will bring the clarity necessary to avoid the downward spiral that comes from giving negative aspects of your life too much attention.\nWhat Happened This Week\nDigital Economics will be open for enrollment next week.

        "content": "Hey, you NEED to become a HIGH-VALUE INDIVIDUAL!\nIf this were a tweet, it would get 10,397 likes.\nIf I were to ask you what becoming \u201cvaluable\u201d means, would you be able to tell me?\nIs it acquiring a certain number of skills?\nIs it how you combine those skills?\nIs it the result those skills get for a person that is receiving that value?\nWhat about the value of that Ferrari? Maybe the value of a human being? Is that NFL cheerleader more valuable to you than the woman that just passed you on the street?\nYou see, nobody really knows the answer to the value equation.\nAnd I don\u2019t think anyone has taken the time to bring value to the word \u201cvalue.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s answer this age-old question:\nWhat IS value?\nThe Psychology Of Value\nIn your brain the down world is managed by a handful of chemicals\u2014neurotransmitters, they\u2019re called\u2014that let you experience satisfaction and enjoy whatever you have in the here and now. But when you turn your attention to the world of up, your brain relies on a different chemical\u2014a single molecule\u2014that not only allows you to move beyond the realm of what\u2019s at your fingertips, but also motivates you to pursue, to control, and to possess the world beyond your immediate grasp. It drives you to seek out those things far away, both physical things and things you cannot see, such as knowledge, love, and power. \u2014 The Molecule Of More\nFrom a external standpoint, value is determined by dopamine.\nThat\u2019s how we label something as valuable by conventional standards, correct?\nWe have a perspective that is conditioned by culture and society, perceive an external stimulus, and become slaves to that feeling of desire.\nThe fancy cars, Rolex watches, models, and six-pack abs on the beach (with water that is a little too blue).\nThe thing is, dopamine is the desire molecule, not the pleasure molecule.\nDesire, and the strength of that desire, is determined by how far away something is from you.\nDopamine has many other determining factors of course like novelty, anticipation, and complexity \u2014 but we are talking about value here.\nWhen we see something that we do not have, we misperceive it.\nWe assume that it holds more value than it does simply because it resides in our extra-personal space \u2014 while other neurotransmitters manage the peri-personal space (the things you possess).\nAs a lesson, remember that your mind will trick you into thinking that something is valuable when there is a gap between you and it.\nWhen you close that gap and possess what you used to deem valuable, it quickly loses it\u2019s shine.\nIn other words, that donut advertisement looks incredible up until you take the first bite. After that, the dopaminergic response falls drastically.\nRemember how much you liked your car when you first got it?\nHow much did you like it after a week? (Trick question, that is dependent on how well you can manage which neurotransmitters are fueling your brain. If you have present moment appreciation for the car, it can retain its perceived value in your eyes).\nDopamine is fuel, not a value determinant.\nPerception, Marketing, & Glamour\nMarketers know this well:\nIf you want to master marketing, master perception.\n\nA better product will always lose to a product that people *think* is better.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 28, 2022\nAs do any creators, influencers, or average Joe\u2019s that are going out to the club on a Friday night.\nWhile the gap between you and your desires impacts the value you project on something, people can manipulate what is on the other side of that gap.\nMarketers polish their products.\nInfluencers polish their brands.\nAverage Joe\u2019s put on their best floral shirt, hair gel, and that new cologne (that promises more women!) before they head out for the night.\nThis isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nI would argue it is a necessary game that must be played, but is often abused.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much I develop my character to a point of value if I can\u2019t even catch someone else\u2019s attention with my external appearance.\nJust like writing content.\nYou can have the same value inside two separate Twitter threads, but the hook will be what influences engagement the most.\nI\u2019m friends with many ghostwriters.\nOne has straight up copied the same thread \u201cbody,\u201d exchanged the \u201chook,\u201d and the difference was millions of impressions and 20,000+ likes.\nThat\u2019s insane.\nThe lesson being, if you have developed intrinsic value, but your extrinsic value is not desirable\u2026 not many will be exposed to the depth of your being, brand, or creations.\nThe second lesson:\nBecome a dopamine dealer, but deliver on the glamour that you display.\nBridge the gap, because if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s called a scam.\nDepth VS Looks\nTrue value requires development over time.\nThis is a universal principle and is one reason I start my week by writing these newsletters.\nIf I want my tweets or other content to be truly valuable (and not just parroting what someone else has said) I have to start with depth.\nI write the newsletter and then condense it into short, punchy, and desire-inducing tweets.\nI teach this process (and the true fundamentals of high impact digital writing / content) in the 2 Hour Writer.\nLike how an author can get thousands upon thousands of likes on the most basic content out there. The reason being is that he wrote an entire book that provides unique perspectives, credibility, and fleshed-out ideas.\nJames Clear could tweet the word \u201chabits\u201d and outperform any account that would do the same. I wonder why.\nIf you are working to \u201cprovide value\u201d in business or relationships, you can\u2019t deliver a present with nothing inside.\nYou can\u2019t expect to make any worthwhile progress if you are only working on the tip of the iceberg. You must create depth.\nThe tip of the iceberg = dopamine\nThe depths of the iceberg = \u201cdown\u201d neurotransmitters, something you can appreciate once the external shine fades.\nYour external appearance should be backed with years of self-development if you want to sustain any fulfilling relationship.\nYour short-form content should be backed with long-form content, direct experience, or research that illustrates the depth behind the short-form content.\nYour offer should have the looks (desired end result) but must also have the depth (customer results) in a way that makes sense as a pair. The gap must be closed when the looks deliver a dopamine hit to the perceiver.\nIf your offer \u2014 your product or service \u2014 does not have looks that match the depth, that\u2019s called a scam.\nThe larger the gap is between looks and depth, the more you aren\u2019t delivering on dopamine, that\u2019s called manipulation.\nOf course, all of this takes time. We are talking about super valuable things here. When you are a beginner, you will have to start small and prove your worth.\nYou can\u2019t skip the experience that comes with going from level 1 to 100, even if you buy a course that shows you how to get there, you still have to put in the reps and directly experience those teachings.\nTo wrap everything up, know that value creation is a lifelong game.\nIf you aren\u2019t committed to creating the most value as humanly possible, my guess is that you are doing the opposite \u2014 sucking the value out of everything while delivering nothing in return.\nFlip the switch.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA new YouTube video, \u201cWhy fear of failure is destroying your future\u201d just went live.\nWatch it here.\nA podcast went up on Monday called \u201cHow To Get What You Want Out Of Your Life & Career\u201d\nListen here.\nInside Modern Mastery, I posted a video on how I design Instagram and LinkedIn carousels with a free software.\nReaders can join for $5."

        "content": "Learning is the foundation of the human experience.\nBut, 99% of people do it wrong.\nNot because they don\u2019t know how to learn, but because they have forgotten how to learn.\nWe are talking about true learning here.\nFor the sake of this letter, things like memorization, knowledge hoarding, and parroting will not be considered learning.\nLearning is a byproduct of experience.\nThe human experience contains more than just words.\nIt is a spectrum of feelings, lights, sounds, tastes, and other distinctions that form a single perspective. Like a snapshot in time. A figment of present moment consciousness that passed in less than a millisecond.\nWords are a layer over reality.\nReality is composed of symbols, metaphors, and energy that we have labeled in order to understand what we hold in our attention as a human being.\nWhere does learning come into play?\nStruggle.\nFailure.\nThe things that everyone shys away from, rather than embracing.\nWhy do we shy away from it? Because we don\u2019t understand what failure is. Why else would you be afraid of it? We don\u2019t have the full picture, the full perspective. Which can only be found through failure itself. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?\nSince learning demands failure, understand that this letter is written for the sake of awareness. You cannot act on what you are unaware of, and if this letter makes you aware of the importance of failure, my job is done. The rest is in your hands. I cannot fail for you.\nKnowing that people hate what they don\u2019t understand, failure is an automatic, unconscious, and pre-programmed \u201chate\u201d for many people.\nThe first step to true learning is changing your perception of failure.\nThat is, not judging, assuming, or expecting it not to be there. Failure is a low-frequency energy source. When tapped into with focus (bringing that energy into your conscious awareness), the associated feeling manifests in your being and you label that energy as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d\nFailure exists. Meaning, if you don\u2019t fix your potentially programmed relationship with it, procrastination and lack of fulfillment will rule your life.\nWhy do we have to fail, struggle, and embrace challenge to truly learn?\nBecause when you are in a \u201cbad\u201d state of consciousness from struggle, your mind is primed to receive a lesson. It is open to receive a solution, internalize it, and lock that learning in for next time.\nMeaning, you have to directly experience the perspective that comes from struggle (resistance), to bring the opposing end (breakthrough) into existence.\nThat perspective is found at the bottom. The feelings associated with it are not something to shy away from.\nThe Portfolio Of Failures\nThere seems to be a threshold of failures that every successful person goes through.\nThat is, there is a set amount of failures that one must encounter when pursuing a specific goal before they learn what it actually takes to succeed.\nI personally failed at 7+ different business models before making my first $1000.\n\u201cDan, would you go back and change anything if you could?\u201d\nThat\u2019s always an interesting question to be asked, as it implies that you want the one \u201csecret\u201d to avoiding failure and remaining comfortable, when failure is the secret.\nKnowing what I know now, no. I wouldn\u2019t go back and change anything. If I did, I would have to fail again, go through the cycle, and end up in the same exact place.\nIf I didn\u2019t fail at creating a design, I wouldn\u2019t have studied methods for making the design better. Which lead to creating a digital art page on Instagram.\nIf I didn\u2019t fail at the digital art page, I wouldn\u2019t have studied web design. Which lead to multiple freelancing endeavors.\nIf I didn\u2019t fail at freelancing, I wouldn\u2019t have studied branding, copywriting, and social media. Which lead to failed ecommerce brands.\nIf I didn\u2019t fail at ecommerce, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten a web design job. Which lead to success in freelancing, pivoting to social media, and being consistent until now.\nBy the end of it, I had an entire arsenal of lessons refined through struggle to make anything I want to pursue work.\nThis is a pattern that can be seen in any \u201cself-made\u201d success. Self-made meaning that they didn\u2019t inherit the money. Go listen to an origin story podcast of any of your favorite people and they will tell you the same story. Failure is unavoidable, necessary, and the closest thing to \u201cget rich quick\u201d that you will find.\nSuccess, in any endeavor, is a process of investing in your portfolio of failures until there is nothing else to fail at. That is, until your investments compound and you can afford to succeed.\nMid Koe Letter Plug: If you want to learn from my failures, readers can join Modern Mastery for $5. There are 180+ strategies that you can test, fail, and build your portfolio of failures faster with.\nHow To Fail Happily: The Intersection Of The Known & Unknown\nHumans find meaning in stories.\nStories are how we make sense of the world.\nWithout us knowing it, our unconscious mind will \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d of anything we perceive.\nWhen you approach a new person, why do you get anxious? Because your mind has already determined the outcome.\nWhen you do one specific thing, like the same exercises in the gym for too long, why do you get bored? Because your mind already knows what to do.\nLife is a game containing an infinite number of games.\nThe games you choose to play will determine the results you get from winning those games.\nWhat\u2019s the catch?\nGames imply a possibility to fail.\nMoreso, when you start playing a new game consistently, you are going to \u201cfail\u201d more often. You don\u2019t go from level 1 to 100 by winning every single match.\nThe masculine wants to feel the bliss of a life lived at the edge, and if he doesn\u2019t have the balls to do it himself, he\u2019ll watch it on TV, in sporting events and cop shows. \u2014 David Deida\nGames are exciting. They are structured stories that you actively play. This is how you find meaning in life: by becoming obsessed with the games that lead to fulfilling results.\nRegarding the quote, don\u2019t get \u201cthe masculine\u201d mixed up as male or female. Everyone has a masculine and feminine edge. It is a form of energy that displays different characteristics throughout reality, not only in humans.\nThe point is that to pursue more, conquer, and the benefits that come from winning a battle is masculine.\nMen and women alike, especially as women take on more masculine activities thanks to technology solving certain problems (and vice versa for men), everyone can:\nClimb the corporate ladder\nBuild businesses around their interests\nCompete in challenging athletic competitions\nTo think that a man can or should be 100% masculine, or that a woman can or should be 100% feminine is silly. Every person has a balance to be kept within themselves. A majority of men are tilted toward the masculine and vice versa for women.\nI\u2019ll leave this topic for another day, but the world is blending together. Collapsing into oneness, some may predict. I don\u2019t care what people identify as, I simply like to observe and piece things together (and not let it make me angry enough to base my identity around destroying those things).\nI thrive when building (m), but know when it\u2019s time to let loose and celebrate (f). Order and chaos. Metaphorical, not literal.\nWhen its hot, you cool down. When it\u2019s cold, you warm up. Some people like being warm most of the time, some cold. When men have a big business win, they celebrate over a beer. Balance.\nThe point being, to live a fulfilling life, the masculine balance in each individual needs to be kept by engaging in battle. That is, playing a game. There needs to be suspense. And even if you don\u2019t identify as having a \u201cmasculine edge,\u201d neglecting that aspect of your being is not wise.\nYin yang.\nWhen all a person\u2019s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person\u2019s attention is completely absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nA battle takes place on a battlefield.\nA game is played with a certain set of rules.\nAny real-life situation presents an environment with certain known and unknown variables.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to play the game, it won\u2019t be fun. You will get anxious.\nA noobie in the gym isn\u2019t going to try to deadlift 400 pounds. He embraces the challenge of his current strength and is excited to progress over the coming months.\nIf you are too good at the game, it also won\u2019t be fun. You will get bored.\nA grandmaster at chess may find enjoyment in the challenge that comes from teaching a beginner, but playing against one? Boring. The grandmaster\u2019s skills must be tested for him to kick into flow. For his attention to be immersed in the goal he is pursuing.\nComfort is found in the known.\nDiscomfort is found in the unknown.\nFulfillment is found at the edge.\nI am sure this is a portion of what the ancients speak of when explaining \u201cno mind\u201d or \u201cnon-duality.\u201d\nA state of consciousness that resembles what modern psychologists have coined as \u201cflow.\u201d\nWhat does this have to do with failure?\nYou can enjoy failing more often by pursuing the right goal.\nOne that isn\u2019t so far away that you get lost in the unknown, but one that isn\u2019t so close that you get bored.\nAnd at the same time, recognized for it\u2019s value.\nA question before we come to an end:\nIs your vision valuable enough to you?\nThat is, have you internalized, appreciated, and thought with depth about how actualizing that vision will spill over into your life?\nIs financial freedom worth 10 years of failure? What\u2019s the other option if not? Is THAT worth 10 years of struggle?\nRepeat that sequence of questions. Swap \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d for anything good. Things that cannot be outsourced or given to you like:\nYour physique and energy levels\nThe brand you develop over your lifetime\nMastering your craft and how you move in the world\nWrite it out. Contemplate your future on a walk. Let your vision become clear with time. It doesn\u2019t come in an instant.\nSit with it.\nYou Don\u2019t Need More Advice\nAsking for advice is outsourcing your ability to act and figure it out for yourself.\n(Asking for advice is not the same as getting specific information for what you are currently acting on, that\u2019s called education, another thing that takes decades).\nLook back up at the graphic.\nYou already know what you need to be executing on.\nYou need to push to the edge of the known, challenge yourself, get a taste of the unknown, and invest in your education about the things you truly don\u2019t know (and when they are the most applicable).\n\u201cShould I start a business?\u201d\n\u201cShould I go to the gym?\u201d\n\u201cShould I ask that person on a date?\u201d\nIf I told you \u201cyes,\u201d would you learn anything? What about if I told you \u201cno?\u201d\nIf you listened to either of thos, you wouldn\u2019t find the answer in the unknown for yourself. You may waste 2-3 years because someone told you not to do something rather than trying it and figuring out for yourself.\nBuild, create, challenge yourself, try everything, and figure it out.\nThat\u2019s what humans do.\n\u2013 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA new podcast went out about writing as a meta skill that everyone should learn.\nListen here.\nA YouTube video went live about why people can\u2019t make money doing their own thing.\nWatch here.\nOn Wednesday I will be posting how I create Instagram carousels from my tweets (and how to post those carousels to LinkedIn for more engagement).\nReaders can join for $5.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can find more free and paid resources below for building yourself and your business."

        "heading": "If You Are High Value, Start A One Person Business",
        "content": "Self-reliance is a value of mine.\nI would argue that it is the driving force behind what I do.\nWhen people would say things like:\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to scale your business! You need to be hiring! Why aren\u2019t you running ads?\u201c\nI doubled down on building digital assets, leverage, and products that required less time from me.\n\u201cYou have to keep doing client work. High ticket is where it\u2019s at bro!\u201d\nI stopped freelancing after transitioning to consulting. I turned my consulting into a hybrid program. That hybrid program is now a cohort.\nEach iteration increasing the value delivered while decreasing my time invested so I can focus on building more leverage (like writing my book and growing on multiple platforms \u2013 which is NOT what you should be focusing on as a beginner).\n\u201cYou need to be going hard on TikToks and reels! The future is headed that way.\u201d\nSo I doubled down on long-form newsletters, podcasts, and YouTube videos.\nLesson: if you want to \u201cdo what you love,\u201d don\u2019t fall for the short-form content trap. Focus on creating depth and authority. That is what people will pay for.\n(This is only for business btw. I\u2019m even more stubborn in my personal life).\nThe greatest thing I did for myself was to ignore everyone\u2019s advice. I didn\u2019t care about hiring someone to fix a part of my business, I wanted to figure it out myself.\nStubborn? Yes.\nTime intensive? Yes.\n(Well, sorta, it took about 3 years to get to where I am now after making my first dollar with creative work. That\u2019s still less time than a 4-year degree. The unpredictability is what scares people off.)\nDid I learn more than any other solopreneur out there and enjoy every second of it? Yes.\nI kept to my vision for the future (as I always encourage you to do):\n3-4 hours of fulfilling work a day until the day I die\nThe flexibility to build whatever I want and get paid for doing so\nHaving more than enough money to live worry-free. Building a billion-dollar company doesn\u2019t appeal to me.\nHaving more than enough time to pursue the important things in life like spirituality, self-development, and nurturing real-life relationships\nNot relying on anybody (be it employees or people in my network) for my personal and professional growth\nThese may not be possible at the start, of course, but that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s a vision that must be actualized over 5-10 years. You have to climb the rungs of the one-person business ladder.\nThat\u2019s what we are here to talk about.\nBusiness As An Extension Of The Self\nThe Internet enables eight billion monopolies.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) November 29, 2020\nThere is one thing that humans can do better than any other being:\n1) Have an idea\n2) Make it real\nThrough consciousness, attention, and focus we have been given the power to build, create, and make.\nDoes this not blow your mind?\nWe can have a vision, gather resources, and build layer by layer the world we inhabit. Both immaterial and material:\nLanguage, buildings, technology, products, services, marketing campaigns, culture, society, school systems, science, philosophy, etc.\nIt seems that our role on this Earth is to solve local problems. Knowing that problems are systemic, not personal, and that solving local problems leads to solving global, and even cosmic, problems.\nAnyone can do this.\nThe problem?\nLimiting beliefs, programmed minds, and a lack of self-belief hold most people back.\nEveryone was an entrepreneur before the industrial revolution. We would hunt for the resources necessary to sustain our life.\nEveryone is a content creator.\n\nSome just take the content in their head and reap the benefits of sharing it with the world.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 21, 2022\nWith many basic needs covered from the start along with the creation of the dollar bill, things have changed.\nWe have the psyche of our ancestors trapped in a modern environment. Like a monkey in a cubicle that mentally decomposes with time due to a lack of intrinsic motivation (and the neurotransmitters involved in said motivation).\nWhy is this happening?\nCultural and societal conditioning. We\u2019ve been conditioned to rely on everything except for ourselves.\nWe were graded on performance and adherence in school. We obeyed our parents and more than likely adopted their belief system without question. Even those who did question still have some residual unconsciousness that impacts the progress they could be making.\nWhat is the answer?\nSelf-reliance on all fronts.\nSovereignty, personal responsibility, self-awareness, self-confidence, self-education, self-interest, and a set of values, goals, and priorities that you can work towards, learn from, and pass down your lessons (enough so that you can make an income from it).\nThis is what a one-person creator business is built from.\nYour brand (how your business is displayed) is created from your vision in goals. What are you building? What are you leading people towards?\nYour content (how you attract people to your brand) is created from the interests and skills you are refining to actualize your vision and goals. Your purpose is to educate, entertain, and inspire along your self-development journey. Leaders attract followers.\nYour product (how you get paid through value) is created from your map of reality. That is, a process, system, or tool that people can use to solve their problems faster. The ones that you were stubborn about solving that led to having a unique perspective and solution.\nThe most profitable niche is you.\nAs a divine creator, your job is to make forward progress, expose yourself to new ideas, and use those ideas to further the progress of humanity.\nBy passing down tools that will accelerate the learning of your followers, the world will continue to evolve as it should.\nI have an inclination to believe that social media was created for this reason. The problem of global communication was solved, potentially for money, but with an impact that nobody could have imagined\u2026 that is, an idea was had and made real, opening up room in the realm of infinite possibility for something to be built on top.\nAre you going to do your part?\nThe Entrepreneurial Method (Get it? Like, the Scientific Method?)\nMost people have a goldmine of information, skill, and experience at their fingertips.\nThe only people that don\u2019t are the one\u2019s that haven\u2019t improved any aspect of their life (by their own doing).\nEveryone is an entrepreneur, some choose to display their value in public.\nFor those that are still with me, here is a 5 part cycle for turning yourself into a business:\n1) Find A Problem\nAll stories, marketing, and products revolve around solving a problem.\n\u201cThere was a cold spot on the side of the bed.\u201d\nIf that was the start of a story, it implies a problem. It opens a curiosity loop that makes people want to discover more.\nProblems are the root of human behavior, real or not. They are what lead to forward progress. Creativity is about creating the best solution, or providing the most clarity.\nDon\u2019t like your situation? In comes dopamine, making you feel good about the desire you have for fancy cars and mansions.\nDon\u2019t like how you look? Want to make more money?\nAre you not curious on what life would be like if those were solved?\nWhatever the problem may be, don\u2019t deny or label it. Move into it.\nMove in a forward direction towards those desires. That is the only way you will discover if you actually want them.\nOf course, you will find out that\u2019s not what you want, but the only other option is to stand still.\nYes, you can and should enjoy the present moment, it\u2019s there when you need it. But suppressing your desires will not lead to anything good, or anything at all.\nYou must dissolve that karma to move closer toward revealing your true purpose.\n2) Experiment With Different Solutions\nSystems, absolutes, and hard advice have their place, but they strip you of your ability to \"figure it out,\" self-experiment, and come to your own conclusions (which is how you become a true expert).\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) August 17, 2022\nThe worst way to solve a problem is to study one perspective and treat it as dogma.\nLike with business.\nIf you start researching how to fix your money problem and only choose to learn from 1 person that is teaching 1 business model, you are shooting yourself in the foot.\nYour job is to pull from multiple perspectives and let the truth accumulate in the middle.\nFrom that crossover of perspectives, you will notice patterns.\nThose patterns are what you need to pay attention to. They are the lever-moving fundamentals that get results. They are also where creativity comes into play, like connecting the dots, making a new discovery, and having a solution that you actually remember.\nLet\u2019s say you study 3 different perspectives (business models) for solving the problem of money:\nFreelance ghostwriting\nStarting an eCommerce brand\nStarting a marketing agency\nYou will notice these patterns:\nYou need a compelling brand to attract the right people\nYou need valuable content that establishes authority and gets shared\nYou need an offer that people actually want (and that gets the results you say it will)\nIf you aren\u2019t building an audience with content, you need a strategy for acquiring customers (like ads, SEO, sponsored posts, etc)\nYou need to understand human behavior and apply it to everything we listed above\nFrom there, you can approach a business model that suits you best. Your focus will be on the fundamentals, and you will grow faster than those drowning in tactics.\n3) Document How You Solved It\nIf I could go back in time, the one thing I would change is to start building an audience earlier than I did. It\u2019s difficult for people to take this advice seriously because all they see is a huge gap.\nPeople see that I have hundreds of thousands of followers and leave it at that (innacurate perception can hurt your decision making).\nWhat they don\u2019t see is that I\u2019m a regular ass dude.\nI identified a money problem in my life\nI was a young, broke college student with less than $0 to my name\nI persisted with freelancing to solve that problem\nI saw results and wrote about it online\nI pivoted my brand in a way that reduced my time spent on client work\nI ignored common business advice, questioned how people told me to do things, and created profitable offers by following step #2\nI continued playing the audience growth game and now people perceive me as some sort of celebrity\nAll I\u2019m trying to tell you is that you have to step into the arena. That alone will open a new world for you. After that, it\u2019s a matter of staying in the arena.\nSide note: Someone asked me recently if they should start growing an audience. They asked how long it would take and if it was worth it. My friend, you tell me. Does it matter how long it takes if this is something you are going to be doing (and enjoying) for the rest of your life anyway?\nEven if you lack experience. You don\u2019t have to write about \u201cmaking 6 figures as a freelancer\u201d if you don\u2019t have those results. You can, however, educate people on the skill you are freelancing with and talk about what you\u2019ve learned growing a freelancing business.\nPeople learn the best when it is from someone that is 1 step ahead of them, not 10. (We all know how trying to skip 9 steps goes, get rich quick scheme alert!)\nNot only does this build authority and make it 10x easier to land clients, but you are building a name for your authentic self.\n4) Distill Into A Replicable Process\nThe best thing I did for myself in business was to be stubborn and self-reliant.\nI would purchase courses and coaching for strategies, but use them as guides, not law. No teaching is absolutely true, and most systems can be made better.\nBut, I would never hire someone to do the work for me. I wanted to create my own writing, website, landing page, product, email marketing, promotions, and the rest.\nIf you hire someone to do it for you, you miss out on real-world experience that can be leveraged into something monetizable.\nAgain, this is why I always emphasize learning by doing, or stepping into the arena and actually building something.\nOnce you have the know-how (through direct experience) and results, you can self-reflect and teach others how to do it faster.\nThis is when free consulting, content, and help comes into play. You have to test that process on people and see if it gets them results.\nThen you ask for testimonials, refine your process, start charging more, repeat, and productize once you have traffic courses built up (through content, audience growth, and building an email list)\nPersonal growth = business growth but only when you post online.\n5) Give It To Others That Want To Be Helped\nWhat is the meaning of life?\nFrom the patterns I\u2019ve seen from studying multiple perspectives while trying to solve this problem (see what I did there?), it comes down to 2 things:\n1) Raising your consciousness\nWhat, exactly, does that mean?\nIt means that you are actively exploring reality, the unknown. You are solving your own problems (that distort reality), making forward progress, and becoming directly conscious of the lessons, insights, and patterns that reality presents.\nYou are making the unknown, known. The unconscious, conscious. The unpredictable, predictable. The non-sensical, sensical.\nYou fulfill your basic survival needs (see: Maslows Hierarchy Of Needs) so you can help the world from a non-needy state. Authenticity.\nThen, you can move on to step 2.\n2) Raising the collective consciousness\nIn essence, you pass down your map of reality so others can navigate it faster.\nThis is a feature of raising your own consciousness, as you will be contributing less and less to the spread of falsehood, while impacting those that interact with you on a frequent basis.\nWhen it comes to business, and with the internet being a thing, you can accelerate this \u201craising of the collective consciousness\u201d by writing about your experiences online.\nYou are helping people solve their money, relationship, health, and happiness problems with free content and paid products.\nContent is pieces of the map.\nProducts are the map itself.\nPeople pay for aggregation, convenience, and speed. (If you don\u2019t believe this, I know that you haven\u2019t started your business yet).\nThe thing is, you can only help people that want to be helped.\nIf someone is not at the experience level where the problem you are solving registers in their awareness, your teaching won\u2019t make sense to them.\nAnd with that, you have to accept that people hate what they don\u2019t understand. Queue the negative comments from the sidelines!\nI will end with this:\n\u201cThe lips of wisdom are closed except to the ears of understanding.\u201d\nThe Kybalion\nEnjoy your Saturday.\nDan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA new YouTube video went out called If You Are Uncertain About Your Future, This Is For You.\nWatch it here.\nA podcast dropped on how your mind is a supercomputer running the game of life (with practical insights on how to play the game well).

Or will your perception prevent you from seeing what\u2019s right in front of you?\nNone of this is easy, but who said it was supposed to be?\nI\u2019ll answer that for ya,\nYou.\nThe Stress Society\nWhat causes stress?\nFocus.\nThat is, where your attention is placed. The contents of your consciousness.\nIs it split and narrow? Distracted? Hyper-focused on what\u2019s happened, what\u2019s going to happen, and what\u2019s not happening?\nOr is it singular and wide?\nAre you seeing the tip of the iceberg? Or what\u2019s underneath?\nSurvival. That\u2019s what\u2019s underneath.\nEvery. Single. Action you take is out of the need for survival.\nNot physical survival like the old days.\nI\u2019m talking survival of the self.\nWhat is the self? It\u2019s an illusion.\nOur mind started as a blank slate.\nAs we aged, we created the self with our mind.\nYou see, the self only exists when hundreds of thousands of external relationships are formed over time.\n\u201cMy name is Dan\u201d is a relationship between me and everyone I come across.\nIf no other \u201cselves\u201d existed, why in the world would I call myself \u201cDan\u201d? Why would I need to speak a certain language? Or words at all?\nIf a specific religion, ideology, cultural norm, expectation, opinion, belief, bias, or word hadn\u2019t registered in your awareness, would it even exist to you?\nThink of the self as a bunch of tiny dots that form the shape of a human. Imagine that the dots are connected to strings.\nWhat happens when one of those strings is plucked, gripped, or threatened?\nStress response. No matter how small (yet compounding).\nOur attention is sucked back to more pressing matters. The survival of the self. An attempt to prevent the death of one string we\u2019ve attached to our identity.\n\u201cOkay, Dan, cool story bro. How does this relate to making me some cold hard cash??\u201d\nYou tell me\u2026\nWhat happens when you encounter an opportunity to make money?\nI\u2019ll tell you what most people do:\nThey misperceive the situation\nThey close their mind to seeing beyond what\u2019s in front of them\nThey immediately label it as a \u201cscam,\u201d impossible, or not for them\nA survival string is plucked and they shut down to preserve their programmed beliefs. If their beliefs around their ability to make money are threatened, they are threatened.\nThink this leads anywhere beneficial?\nInstead, you must pause, seek to understand every moving piece of the information you receive through observation.\n\u201cYeah this guy Dan sells a 2 Hour Writer course.\u201d\n2 hours? Lol, you think you can just work for two hours and call it a day?\nWriting? Creativity? You think that\u2019s monetizable? Nobody can do what they love. Back to working for the boss that is doing what he loves!\n(Nobody has said this, but I guarantee some random social media lurkers are thinking it. Eagerly awaiting their chance to leave a negative comment that serves their future in zero possible ways.)\nThis is an exaggeration, but can you not see how obvious it is? How people choose what they want to see, stop there, and fill in the rest of the story with assumptions.\nAnother example:\nHow does it make you feel when you have to talk about money? Or even when it\u2019s brought up?\nWhich survival strings are threatened?\nIs it uncomfortable? Do you get mad? Does it immediately make you think to the bill you have to pay when the paycheck deposits on Friday?\nDive deeper. Consider the possibility. Think critically.\nMoney buys freedom in the external world.\nSpirituality returns freedom in the internal world.\nWe will discuss survival again under a different lens, because life is more than just money, of course.\nBut for a majority of the population, money would decrease the amount of stress they experience by ~80%.\nSolving your money problems opens up room for relaxation, creativity, and solving the deeper, internal problems that lead to true happiness.\nAnd\u2026 it just feels good to fend for yourself, but why?\nThe molecule of More, dopamine, rewards you like it did our ancestors when they had to hunt.\nLike how a monkey will get a dopamine response when a light bulb goes off (that signals it will get food) rather than no dopamine response when it gets the same food at the same time.\nOur psyche is wired for entrepreneurship.\nThat is, our psyche is wired to be rewarded for the novelty, anticipation, and unpredictability that comes from hunting for our survival. That is how you leverage dopamine in a useful way\n7 Practical Money Lessons That Will Make You [infinite]X More Than A College Degree\nAbstractions on survival are fun to talk about, they help with self-understanding, but how do you implement those teachings?\nBy holding them in your awareness as you improve your money situation.\nAs you go through these lessons, notice when you feel a negative thought, emotion, or feeling come into your awareness. Question it.\n1) The Man In The Arena\nMaking money is a skill, not a talent.\nSkills are refined with practice.\nHow do you practice making money?\nWell, it\u2019s not like a sport where you can get a few of your buddies and still reach the end goal: scoring a point.\nWith money, you have to step into the arena.\nThe exchange of money is not a battle, but if you don\u2019t have an \u201copponent\u201d (that has money to give) on the other side of the arena, you aren\u2019t giving yourself a fighting chance.\nNobody to give you money = no real-world use of your skills = no money being put in your pockets.\nIt is not, and should not, just appear out of thin air and into your bank account. Your psyche is wired to hunt. Not to be a monkey collecting bananas in his virtual banana stash with zero effort.\nThis is why so many have money problems. They love talking about money, especially in a negative light, but when it comes time to make more? Crickets. That would mean they have to do something uncomfortable. Criticism is the loudest from the bleachers. Booooo!\nStudying courses on how to make money is not making money.\nBuilding a product, website, or app to make money is not making money.\nLearn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018\nYou have to build, and sell.\n2) Open Your Mind\nPeople are slaves to money because they believe they are incapable of making more.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to college, I can\u2019t get a high paying job.\u201d\n\u201cWriting? Don\u2019t you have to be like a poet to do that?\u201c\n\u201cLol you think that guy really hit $100K this month? What\u2019s the profit? Either way, I\u2019m going to go with\u2026 scam!\u201d\nPeople will feed themselves a self-limiting story that narrows their perception to the point of not seeing the infinite opportunities staring them in the face (your phone). Being broke becomes their reality, and their actions follow.\n3) Fundamentals Are King\nIn business, you need 2 things:\nValue: A product or service that promises a desirable result (and delivers on that promise).\nPeople: Well, this is obvious, but often glanced over. You need people to see the value you have to offer if you want to exchange it for money.\nLike with dating.\nIf you are valuable, attention-grabbing, and deliver on the value you display but aren\u2019t in an environment with ample people\u2026 how can you expect to land a date?\nIf you are in an environment (physical or digital) with ample people, but aren\u2019t a person of value\u2026 same story.\nIf you were to apply the fundamentals to the online landscape, people come from media, just like you\u2019re reading this media right now.\nMedia is the frontend of the internet. It\u2019s what captures, holds, and delivers value on attention.\nWriting, speaking, video, audio, design.\nI prefer writing, as it helps you refine your message before you repurpose it for other mediums. Like how this letter will be used as a soft YouTube script.\nIf you want to learn an evergreen skill for the digital economy and implement my content ecosystem, check out The 2 Hour Writer.\nMedia attracts people, but how do you create, display, and promote the value you have to offer?\nMarketing, sales, influence, persuasion, and building with no-code tools.\nBy learning a skill that will help you succeed in either domain (people or value), your skills crossover and complement each other. Especially if you are in the online \u201carena\u201d with a personal brand.\nTouching back to \u201copening your mind,\u201d skill acquisition is one way to aid in that.\n4) The One Person Business\nThe internet has leveled the playing field for what\u2019s possible.\nWhat used to take:\n\n\u2013 A few thousand bucks\n\u2013 A team of employees\n\u2013 Years of study and practice\n\nCan now be done with a free software.\n\nYou can laser focus on developing a high value skill set to leverage these tools.\n\nIt's cliche, but the opportunity has never been higher.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) September 2, 2022\nThe one-person business is all about maximizing your time freedom, doing what you truly enjoy, and making more than enough money doing it.\nI believe this is the best option for 99% of people. Not dreaming of starting a billion-dollar behemoth of a company and never doing anything about it.\nIt\u2019s all about small steps, personal growth, and providing as much value as you can.\nHere\u2019s how you go about it:\nStart a service business.\nStudy your interests\nStart a service business\nGrow an audience\nWork for free\nDevelop your process\nIncrease prices\nRepeat 5-6\nProductize your process\n\nThis takes 2 years for potential $50K+ months & 3 hour workdays\n\nCollege takes 4 years for potential $10K months & 9 hour workdays\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) January 11, 2022\nIf you can\u2019t leverage money or an audience to send people to a product. Start with a service.\nWhy?\nBecause you can cold email, cold DM, or create a strategy to get in front of more people on social media.\nAnd, because it is easier (yes, easier) to sell a more expensive service with direct response marketing, sales, and a proper cold outreach strategy.\nNow, would you be able to create an income for yourself in a few months by trying to sell a low cost product in the DMs?\nNo, you need more money, results, and authority before you can sell a product through your brand.\nBut with the right strategy, you can land 4+ $2500 clients through DMs and email alone.\nBuild an audience on the side.\nYou don\u2019t want to be sending cold DMs forever. It only makes sense to build leverage in the form of an audience.\nWhat do you talk about? Actionable advice related to the service you are selling.\nIf you sell health coaching, talk about health.\nIf you sell marketing services, talk about marketing.\nIf you sell accounting services, talk about money.\nThis will establish authority, put you on the radar of hundreds of thousands of people, and expand your network.\nThink about it, you don\u2019t only have direct access to your audience, you have indirect access to every audience of people that follow you.\nTake a moment to think about that. It\u2019s actually nuts.\nProductize once you have results.\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten results for our clients and built an audience talking about our expertise, it\u2019s time to productize.\nCreate a product with the exact system and actions you take with your service business on a daily basis.\nYou can use your client testimonials for initial social proof during your launch.\nThis letter is already getting very long, so I\u2019m going to leave the one-person business for an entirely separate letter.\nIf you want 180+ strategies, trainings, and step-by-step roadmaps for building a one-person business (and high-performance mind), check out Modern Mastery. Readers can join for $5.\n5) Think Big, Act Small\nWhen you\u2019re lost, try everything and see what sticks.\n\nWhen you\u2019re overwhelmed, drop everything and see what sticks.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) September 1, 2022\nOpening your mind to the potential of being rich is the first step to becoming rich.\nRiches demand a balance of creativity and productivity.\nCreativity demands an open mind and meta-perspective.\nProductivity demands a clear mind and narrow focus.\nCreativity is like you are floating in space. The stars are ideas that register in your awareness. Profitable solutions are created when you create constellations, connections between the stars.\nProductivity is like you\u2019re on a rocket ship to the moon. There is no thought. It is calculated, planned, and foolproof. You cut through the air and arrive at your destination in record time\u2026 because the outcome was already decided.\nCreativity is about connection, productivity is about clarity.\nSchedule dedicated time for both.\nYou can use my Fill Empty Use framework to find your own balance.\n6) Increase Baseline Income, Maintain Baseline Lifestyle\nIn solopreneurship, everything is unpredictable. (This is a good thing)\nSure, you can create a membership or other recurring monthly offer that can create some stability\u2026 but the point is, you will have both high and low months.\nI hit my first $100K month last week.\nI\u2019m not going to hit that this month unless I actively try, but I need to rest.\nThat being said, hitting $100K means that my baseline has increased.\nThis seems to always happen after a period of tactical stress.\nTactical stress:\n\nThe conscious decision to put yourself in a do or die situation \u2013 knowing that you have the skill to make it work \u2013 and will accept nothing less than success.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 13, 2022\nI will force myself to launch a product or promotion, make it public, and have to get it done or else I would be a public failure.\nI\u2019ve done this once a year, and I would attribute a majority of my growth to it. Most people get stuck in dreamland and never publish the project they\u2019ve been building.\nThat being said, lifestyle creep can be a real thing.\nYou\u2019ll hit a high month, something you never could\u2019ve imagined, and celebrate by making a big purchase.\nMeaning, you increased your baseline lifestyle demands.\nMore stuff = more responsibility = more resources being utilized = less resources to go towards business = lower monthly income = difficulty sustaining that lifestyle.\nIf your lifestyle demands increases with your income, you\u2019re not going to have a good time.\n7) Leverage Your Time, Then Your Mind\nEarn with your mind, not with your time.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) December 17, 2019\nManual labor implies that there is a limit on how much you can work, meaning there is a limit on how much you can make.\nThe highest-paid earners are the strategists, visionaries, and innovators of the world.\nYes, even if they don\u2019t start a billion-dollar company.\nA $1M/year one-person business demands creativity, leverage, and productization.\nMy goal is to have products and digital real estate in place to the point where I can spend ALL of my time writing. No-code tools, automations, and social media handles the rest.\nUnless you have ample cash flow to invest in audience growth or traffic acquisition (people) you\u2019re going to have to spend time building that cash flow with a service business.\nOnce you\u2019ve built digital leverage through audience growth, have gotten results with your service, and are ready to productize\u2026 that\u2019s where the real fun begins.\nMost people get stuck in the feast or famine client business because they don\u2019t use their mind. They don\u2019t realize the value of digital leverage, don\u2019t grow, and spend their time in an endless cycle of cold DMs and emails.\nBuild an audience. Build an email list. Build a list of buyers.\nBuild distribution, then build whatever you want.\n\u2014 Jack Butcher (@jackbutcher) May 22, 2021\nThat\u2019s digital leverage. Once they\u2019re big enough, build whatever you want.\nThat\u2019s all for this letter.\nIf you enjoyed it, you\u2019ll enjoy what happened this week off of surface-level social media (below).\nDan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nWe\u2019re still getting some incredible feedback from the 2 Hour Writer. People are growing from Instagram reels and TikToks with writing (yes, you read that correctly), writing incredible newsletters that build authority, and having a content ecosystem that separates you from the sea of new creators.\nCheck out 2HW here.\nInside Modern Mastery we had a brand workshop. We broke down Based Realists profile, threw in some profile design education for getting maximum followers, and answered questions.\nJoey posted the Creator Tech Stack going over the best software to start your one-person creator business (if you\u2019re looking to break into this space).\nReaders can get access to both (and more) for $5 here.\nAs always, YouTube will be up later. Podcast is starting back up soon. Keep an eye on those if you\u2019re interested."

        "content": "The modern education system is great at one thing:\nTraining people into replaceable jobs.\nThis was a realization I had before I went to college. I knew that even if I went, finding the right career for me wasn\u2019t over when graduation came around.\nI had 2 options if I wanted to make more than enough money to eliminate the problems that come from money:\nOption 1:\nClimb the corporate ladder\nUse my skills to build someone elses business\nSacrifice my wants and time for a higher paycheck\nOption 2:\nCreate my own ladder\nUse my skills to build my own business\nSacrifice my free time for leverage toward my goals\nI\u2019m being dramatic here, of course.\nI\u2019ve been self-employed for 3-4 years now and I am extremely out of touch with most things. I have a distorted perception of corporate work and am well aware of that.\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, there are few lines of work that have a shred of the benefits that self-employment do.\nAmple rest, pursuing an intrinsic hierarchy of goals, not sitting in front of artificial blue light for 8 hours, the pursuit of mastery and the deep sense of satisfaction that comes with it\u2026 the list goes on.\nThe human psyche, general health, and the basic need for self-actualization are pushed under the rug for the sake of making a predictable amount of money.\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense when good dopamine comes from hunting for your own survival, pursuing the goals you set, and achieving mastery in the skills you choose \u2014 not someone that offers to hold your hand toward their goals.\nHow do you prevent or escape this reality?\nSkill acquisition, building a creative income source, and adopting the value of self-sufficiency.\nBut there\u2019s more.\nThe internet has leveled the playing field.\nPeople of all experience levels are solving their own problems, learning new skills, and posting their findings online in an engaging way.\nThis kills 4 birds with one stone.\nLearning leverage building skills through experience (like writing, persuasion, and other marketable skills that come with building a brand)\nBuilding digital leverage (a following, network, and digital real estate that lives online forever)\nStudying the interests they truly want to pursue (and learning about them by organizing their ideas and posting online)\nOffering help to those 1-2 steps behind them (because people are losing trust in the \u201csystem\u201d and want to learn from a human)\nThe state of modern education has been changing right before our eyes.\nLike Bitcoin, education will continue to decentralize.\nCreators are the new teachers.\nConsumers are the new students.\nThe New Education System\nThe current education system will not prepare you for the future of work.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) July 12, 2022\nIn reality, what I\u2019m going to teach you is the old education system.\nLong before government-supported schools came into play, how did we learn?\nFrom our parents, community, and experiences.\nWe touched fire, cried for a few minutes, and learned that life implies risk. Some controllable, some the product of self-deception and illusion.\nAs humans without an expected path to take (for the sake of being a perfect fit into the society that we\u2019ve constructed) we pursued our curiosity, learned from experience, and sought out mentors that could help us accelerate our unique path.\nWe\u2019ve got it all backward.\nSince we were young, we\u2019ve been conditioned to:\nPlease others and be graded on performance (rather than what we truly learned)\nCater to the wants and needs of society (because accepting someone elses ideology is easier than creating our own way of living)\nLimit our own minds to the point of wondering, \u201cIs this all there is?\u201d\nThis is a disaster.\nGo to school, do what you\u2019re told, get a degree, be trained into a replaceable job with a set income that determines your value in society\u2026\nQuestion nothing, only see what\u2019s in front of you, and don\u2019t you dare be better than me! I say I want the best for you\u2026 but that\u2019s just a guise to justify my unconscious actions that signal the opposite.\nThe new education system doesn\u2019t rely on society.\nIt relies on you.\nSelf-education is the answer, but nobody knows how to self-educate\u2026 and that\u2019s kinda the point.\n5 Steps To Take Your Education Into Your Own Hands\nWe haven\u2019t entered another renaissance era.\nIdeas, information, and advice are everywhere.\nPeople are losing trust in religion, government, and forced ideology.\nThis leaves us in a perpetual state of anxiety and uncertainty. Order has been lost and our minds are hit with the backlash.\nIn the past, religious doctrine and accepted cultural standards gave us an external hierarchy of goals to pursue. It brought order to our lives. We didn\u2019t have to think about what the future held. A blessing and a curse.\nNow, we must take matters into our own hands. Here\u2019s how:\n1) Know Thyself\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want, understand what you don\u2019t want and work in the opposite direction.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 15, 2022\nWhat do you want in your future?\nHow are you going to get there? What are the goals?\nWhy do you want to get there? What is important to you?\nContemplate your vision, goals, and values over the next week. Then internalize these next steps.\n2) Pursue Your Curiosity\n3 things:\nPotential utility\nPotential creativity\nPotential enjoyability\nThose are what you should look for when building a profitable skill stack.\nYes, stack. Not singular skill.\nThis is where most creatives go wrong. You can\u2019t just create art all day and hope someone sees it the way you do.\nIf you want to pursue an artistic skill, great, do it, but you must be open to offering that skill in a way that helps others get what they want.\nWriting, marketing, sales.\nLearn those. That gives any other skill you choose to learn utility.\nEnjoyability? That comes with the process. Try things out. Throw sh*t at a wall.\n3) Start A Personal Project\nYou can read books and listen to advice all day long, but it means nothing unless you apply and experience those teachings.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) December 30, 2021\nProjects are powerful.\nOne, they get you out of tutorial hell, the endless cycle of learning that tricks you into thinking that you are making progress.\nTwo, they force you to build something that serves a function in the real world.\nKeyword: build.\nThree, they teach you how to pursue sources of good dopamine. You can make progress, get obsessed, and feel the energy that all great entrepreneurs talk about.\nWrite a newsletter and uncover the holes in your writing.\nCreate a banner for your brand and be forced to research tools you can use to create those images.\nBuild out that \u201cmillion dollar\u201d app idea that you had last year. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t look up \u201chow to build an app\u201d on YouTube, do some digging, and spend a few months actually doing it.\nDon\u2019t let your mind fool you.\n4) Seek Specific Knowledge\nFail, then learn.\n\nAct, then ask.\n\nMove, then steer.\n\nA tank full of gas, directions on the map, and hands on the wheel is nothing but wishful thinking if your foot is off the pedal.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) August 21, 2022\nBuilding a project will expose what you don\u2019t know.\nTrying to learn everything before you start will only delay this process.\nWhen you hit a wall, find the solution.\nBuy a course, watch a YouTube video, ask a specific question to someone you follow on social media, join a community, and overall\u2026 just get involved in a digital space that talks about your interests.\nThat\u2019s the beautiful thing about this \u201cnew education system.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t have to pay a pretty penny to get the answers you need. Everything is out there. People just don\u2019t know what to look up because they haven\u2019t started a project, failed, and been given a reason to look up something specific.\nCreators are the new professors, but teach information that the professors can\u2019t teach until the next curriculum update.\n5) Take Your Project Public\n\u201cGive me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the world.\u201d \u2014 Archimedes\nThe internet gives anyone the opportunity to build leverage.\nPersonal websites\nWriting and educating on social media\nBuilding an audience and accepting payments\nHosting, managing, and distributing your project\nThe coders of the world have been building solutions for years.\nMost people can do whatever they want if they learn the rules, play the game, and be the \u201cman in the arena.\u201d\nOne thing I want you to know:\nYou will never ever ever get paid for doing what you love if you don\u2019t have people to support you.\nThe internet gives you access to any and all people with a wi-fi connection (if you have a strategy and the know-how to get in front of them).\nBuild your project in public. Talk about your journey. Inspire others. And get the feedback necessary to make it a success.\n(And remember, no feedback is still feedback. If something isn\u2019t working, giving up isn\u2019t the solution, clearly.)\nUntil next time, my friends.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nThe 2 Hour Writer is live! We had an incredible launch and 800+ students get access yesterday. Some kind words started flowing in this morning:\nIf you want to use my writing and content system, consider checking it out.\nEnroll in the 2 Hour Writer.\nIn Modern Mastery, the personal brand master herself, Sana, posted \u201cHow To Collaborate With Top Creators,\u201d a key for growing on socials and meeting the people you look up to.\nWe also have a brand workshop scheduled for this Wednesday. We will be ripping apart profiles and teaching you how to best present yourself online.\nReaders can join MM for $5.\nA new YouTube video about 9 steps I would take to start a writing business from scratch just went live.\nWatch the new video here."

        "content": "I\u2019ve noticed one pattern in every:\nSuccessful entrepreneur\nEnlightened spiritual guru\nHappy married couple\nRecord breaking athlete\nWhat pattern?\nFocus.\nI\u2019ve heard one person \u2014 from each category above \u2014 mention that \u201cfocus\u201d is the key to their success, happiness, and progress.\nAfter burning through books on performance, happiness, business, spirituality, philosophy, and anything else related to life enjoyment\u2026 I think I\u2019ve found the answer.\nThe key to maximum life enjoyment that is (with a byproduct of success in any of your endeavors.)\nA person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening \u201coutside,\u201d just by changing the contents of consciousness. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihaly\nFocus is controlled consciousness.\nOr, focus is controlling the \u201ccontents of consciousness.\u201d\nWhen the contents of your consciousness, the things you are focused on, can be made sense of in a positive manner; your life becomes positive.\nMeaning, if you strive for clear, unbiased perception from an advantageous perspective of any given situation, you will feel incredible.\nThis also brings up a point made by Leo from Actualized.org about how everything is a figment of consciousness. Example: an atom is a figment of consciousness. It is a label we created to make sense of something when we became conscious of it. That is a tad more metaphysical, but it\u2019s interesting to make the connection.\nBy maintaining focus on individual \u201cfigments of consciousness\u201d \u2014 instead of split between 10 figments \u2014 we can lead happy, healthy, and fulfilling lives.\nContent Of Consciousness\nI want you to think of your mind as a supercomputer.\nYour ability to process information is dependent on a few things, but I want to bring attention to your RAM.\nRAM \u2014 or \u201crandom access memory\u201d \u2014 is one of the most important parts of a computer, it determines performance.\nThe more RAM you use up with different programs running, open browser tabs, and the performance requirements of what you have running, the slower your performance will be.\nThis is no different from your focus, what you hold in your conscious attention.\nHumans can process 126 bits of information per second. That adds up to 185 billion bits of information in your lifetime.\nMost people live with multiple high-demand programs running that are draining the limited creative energy they have.\nThoughts about regretful past mistakes\nThoughts about stressful future happenings\nDesires of hunger and entertainment to escape those thoughts\nAn internal cry to break out of their conditioned way of living\nA list of mixed-priority tasks that need to be finished\nOpen loops of tasks they were supposed to complete but forgot about\nThe list goes on and on.\nThe modern mind has it\u2019s attention split in infinite directions by default. We go about our lives stressed and near sickness. Rather than living in the present with singular focus and a worry free mind, we are the opposite. Living in a false reality created by split attention.\nWhen we hold too much of the past or future in the contents of our consciousness, chaos ensues. The mind tends toward disorder. If not kept in check, we lose the sense of control over our lives that leads to enjoyment. This is accomplished through controlled consciousness.\nAKA, Focus.\n8 Steps To Reclaiming Your Focus\nTo break out of our robotic ways of living, we must first become aware of how it is impacting our life.\nFrom chaos to order, we must bring out attention back to center and choose what deserves our attention.\nThe less RAM we use \u2014 the more singular our focus \u2014 the more enjoyable life becomes. Order returns and the sense of control over our lives results in a deep satisfaction with life itself.\n1) Choose A Lagging Area In Your Life\nWe are only as strong as our weakest link. The areas that are lagging the furthest behind hold the lowest hanging fruit. These are the areas that cause the most problems.\nThink, what area of my life is consistently causing problems that if they were solved, your quality of life would shoot through the roof.\nMoney? Dating? Mental health? Self-esteem? Social life? Health and energy levels? Take a walk, contemplate, and choose the one that, when fixed, the results would ripple through other areas of your life.\nFor the sake of this post, and a common problem for many, let\u2019s talk about money as a lagging area.\n2) Gain Clarity On The Fundamentals\nI want to make a distinction between:\nBasics, principles, or fundamentals\nTactics, hacks, and technical details.\nFundamentals drive results. Technical details can further results, but only once the fundamentals are mastered, systemized, and habitual.\nFundamentals move levers. Technical details present the opportunity for traps, overwhelm, and creating problems that don\u2019t exist.\nFor our focus area of money, you need traffic and an offer. This is a universal principle for getting what you want.\nIf you don\u2019t have traffic:\nA social media audience\nPaid ads or promotions\nA community or group\nOrganic search results\nDirect outreach (i.e. cold email)\nNobody will see your offer.\nIf you don\u2019t have a compelling offer:\nDigital or physical product\nFreelance or consulting service\nCohort based course or online tutoring\nMembership offer or community\nYou won\u2019t have anywhere to send traffic to.\nLike if you are in the dating market.\nIf you are a high-value \u201coffer\u201d but don\u2019t put yourself in \u201ctraffic\u201d heavy environments, good luck.\n3) Create An Ability-Based Goal\nThere is nothing wrong with focusing on looking better, gaining more followers, getting the most engagement, having the hottest partner, etc. Those have their use cases and can be beneficial. I would recommend paying mind to these, but not making them your primary focus.\nThe problem: vanity-based goals are much more out of our control than ability-based goals.\nThese steps are not linear, it will be difficult to create an ability-based goal unless you are educated on the lever-moving actions you can take on a daily basis.\nIn our case, if I want to build an audience (traffic) and sell a digital product (offer) to make money \u2014 you will need to execute on levers such as:\nWriting 3 short-form posts a day (like tweets)\nWriting 1 long-form post a week (newsletter / blog)\nCondensing that long post into a medium form post (like a thread of LinkedIn post)\nSpending 30-60 minutes writing out a curriculum for your digital product\nIn this case, you could make it a goal to write 1000 high-quality words a day, and gauge yourself on the writing (instead of the results that come from it.\nProcess over outcome.\nSpeaking of writing, this is everything we go over in The 2 Hour Writer.\n4) Self-Educate After You Start\nThe fundamentals will get you started, but you need to learn how to apply those fundamentals to your specific situation.\nToo many people get trapped in \u201ctutorial hell,\u201d try to soak in as much information as possible, and never start.\nInstead:\nStart and fail fast\nIdentify what caused you to fail\nFind specific information to overcome it\nFail again and let experience compound with time\nStop trying to figure everything out before you start. That\u2019s called mental masturbation.\n5) Block Out 30-60 Minutes A Day\nDeep work doesn\u2019t only apply to work. It applies to every area of your life.\nWhen entrepreneurs want to make progress in business, they dedicate time and energy to make that progress.\nWhen married couples want to make progress in their relationships, they dedicate time for each other.\nWhen individuals want to make progress with their mind, they dedicate time to solitude and consciousness work \u2014 like meditation.\nDistraction-free time must be made so that your attention isn\u2019t split when it is time to engage in \u201cdeep work,\u201d no matter the domain of life.\n6) Immerse Yourself In The Content Of That Goal\nFor the spiritually inclined, this is \u201cpresence.\u201d\nFor others, this is known as being \u201cengaged\u201d and tapped into a degree of the flow state.\nThink of how you give your full attention to your phone when you are scrolling social media. Marketers and tech companies have entire teams dedicated to triggering a pseudo-flow state through attention capture.\nWhen you get sucked into your phone, there is nothing else held in your attention. Most use this to escape reality rather than tapping into reality itself.\nIf your goal is related to relationships, practice filling your attention with the entirety of the other person. Their body, movements, words. Use all of your senses to feel into the moment and make that the forefront of your consciousness.\n7) A Moment Of Recognition\nNone of this comes easy. You will fail. That\u2019s just how things are.\nA distraction will register in your awareness, your attention will split, and you may get sucked into a negative feeling that the distraction triggered.\nAll it takes is a moment of recognition to snap yourself out of it.\nWhether it be complaining through a grueling workout or being scared to approach someone new because of the identity you\u2019ve created for that person before you\u2019ve even talked to them.\nPause, recognize that you are resisting reality, and let it flow.\nYour expectation of reality is not reality.\nIt\u2019s not \u201csupposed\u201d to be how you think it should be.\nIt\u2019s supposed to be what it\u2019s being.\n8) Put In The Metaphorical Reps\nEverything is a muscle.\nYour focus, relationships, business, fitness, spiritual practice, and habits of any kind. They grow with focus, ample energy to fuel performance and recovery, and direct experience so you can double down on what works for you.\nDo not expect quick results. Even with steroids (like courses, coaching, methods and systems) you still have to put in the reps. You can\u2019t inject some test, sit on the couch, and expect to be the next Ronnie Coleman.\nTreat every area of your life as a science project.\nIdentify a problem\nSet a desired outcome\nTest different solutions\nFind one that works\nReplicate the results\nFrom there, continue building the muscle toward your desired outcome. Then, you will be experienced enough to know whether you want to bulk, cut, or maintain.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nMy new course, The 2 Hour Writer, is off to a great presale. It launches on the 27th and we have 150+ students waiting for the curriculum to drop.\nIf you want to learn a skill that will enhance your content, sales, perceived value, and any other marketable skillset you have, check it out here.\nA new YouTube video went live on my 3 part framework for effortless productivity.\nWatch it here.\nWe are having a diet and lifestyle workshop inside Modern Mastery next week. Our goal is to help everyone create their own system for their health goals, whether it be building muscle, dropping fat, enhancing your energy for work, or just looking good (in a sustainable manner).\nKoe Letter readers can join for $5."

I was constantly reminded of it. There wasn\u2019t a single moment from age 16-25 where I wasn\u2019t working on a meaningful side project.\nI still maintain this habit to this day. If it isn\u2019t a business project, its a health project. This is how I get out of a rut, because the only reason I fall into a rut is psychic entropy, the mind tending toward disorder. Meaning I don\u2019t have a goal, project, or priority to bring my focus to. When I spend time contemplating an area I want to make progress in, a vision will pop into my head after some time. The result? A dramatic boost in my quality of life. IF I act on that vision immediately.\nMy current projects are my new writing product and getting my compound lifts back up in the gym after an extended break from them. I really want to hit a 600 pound deadlift for some reason, even when I swore off of them a few years ago. It just sounds fun, risk aside (and risk adding to the fun and necessity of maintaining healthy habits).\nWhy am I telling you this?\nBecause I realized that nobody knew what they were talking about. I was taking career and life advice from people that hadn\u2019t achieved what I wanted to achieve. In their closed mind the reality I wanted to create was impossible, yet I kept looping back to projects that I loved working on for the sake of maintaining my sanity.\nMeaning, if I could find a way to monetize these \u201cpassion projects\u201d then I would be set.\nAfter years of trial and error with every \u201cmarketable skill\u201d that people tell you to learn, I found the secret.\nWhy Writing?\nThe backend of the internet is code. The frontend of the internet is media. If you want to thrive in the future, mastering code or media is your best bet. If you can master \u2014 or build a team \u2014 to take advantage of both (like marketing a software company) you shouldn\u2019t have any worries about your life direction.\nThat is, being able to leverage both media and code. Which is more than possible with no-code tools like website builders, membership dashboards, email sending platforms, and other software that makes the one-person business model possible.\nDo you not see the power in this? Does this not fuel you with immense energy to learn anything and everything available to you? Why have you not started failing at building a business when you can leverage code and learn media to build your mini-empire while spreading a message that you love spreading?\nI learned to code in college, but I didn\u2019t care for becoming a programmer. I wanted to freelance. So that\u2019s what I tried to do. Web design, SEO, Facebook ads, content marketing, digital art, and every other skill under the sun\u2026 except for one.\nThere was a reason I failed at all of these business models. I didn\u2019t understand what people actually wanted to buy. Not only that, I didn\u2019t know how to get them to buy what I had to offer. That\u2019s when I found Twitter. People were talking about online business and self-improvement. I got sucked in.\nSome accounts that were posting insights about eCommerce mentioned a skill called \u201ccopywriting.\u201d When I studied it deeper, that seemed to be the piece I was missing. Copywriting, in my definition, is persuasive writing. Think marketing and sales \u2014 two of the most important skills for making an income \u2014 but in written form.\nAs you could guess, this was the missing piece to my success. I started writing on Twitter to practice my writing, learned from my failures, and built a cumulative 350K follower audience across multiple platforms.\nAgain, Why Writing?\nMedia is the frontend of the internet. It\u2019s how you capture, hold, and convert attention in a sea of self-deprecating memes and valueless content.\nThe foundation of media is writing.\nTweets? Writing.\nThreads? Writing.\nNewsletters? Writing.\nBlog posts? Writing.\nCold emails? Writing.\nAds of any form? Starts with writing.\nYouTube videos? Done best with written scripts.\nInstagram reels and TikToks? Like reading well-written tweets.\nImages on Instagram? Usually designed from a well-written quote or saying.\nAny other form of online marketing, advertising, or entertainment? Starts with writing.\nThere\u2019s a reason I can outperform every dude with six pack abs in terms of engagement and follower growth on Instagram.\nHigh-impact digital writing.\nIf you want to become a master of media (and leverage no-code tools to distribute your writing and attract an audience) it\u2019s pretty clear that writing needs to be the foundation of your one-person business.\nBefore we dive in: Pre-sale for the 2 Hour Writer is now live. If you are an aspiring writer, one person business owner, or content creator that wants to implement my content ecosystem \u2014 you can get 40% off here until the launch date.\n9 Steps To Starting A One-Person Writing Business\nI call myself a writer because that is what I do on a daily basis (even when it doesn\u2019t seem like it on social media).\nI\u2019ve sustained a $40-$60,000 per month income by writing tweets, newsletters, and threads that get repurposed into Instagram posts, YouTube videos, LinkedIn posts, and the rest.\nIn reflection, and referring to the top of this letter, writing is the force multiplier that helped me make my previous salary month after month.\nBut, if you were to strip things down to only Twitter and a Newsletter, I would still maintain 85-90% of my income. I don\u2019t promote often, if at all, on other platforms. I\u2019m building leverage and cross platform authority for now.\nGetting into it, here are the 9 steps to start your writing business.\n1) Choose A Topic You Can\u2019t Shut Up About\nChoosing a topic is what everyone struggles with in content creation. Let me make it simple for you.\nWrite down:\nYour favorite books\nYour recent YouTube watch history\nYour favorite social media accounts\nWhat you would write about if money wasn\u2019t an issue\nSeriously, pull out a piece of paper (or the notes app in your phone) and write down these all down.\nWhy are we doing this?\nBecause good writing isn\u2019t about being professional. It\u2019s about energy transfer. You will be excited to sit down and write everyday and that energy will show in your writing.\n2) Brainstorm A Unique Perspective You Have\nNovelty catches attention. Attention is a given if you want people to read what you write.\nNovel perspectives are the best (and replicable way) to capture attention.\nHow do you come up with a novel perspective?\nBraindump:\nCommon problems associated with the topic\nBenefits to overcoming those problems\nCommon goals associated with the topic\nRoadblocks to achieving those goals\nPersonal experiences you\u2019ve had\nNow, piece everything together and explain it how you would if you were talking to a friend.\nDon\u2019t try to copy someones perspective or way of wording things. Say it in your own voice and let it refine with time, effort, and practice.\nIf you want a guided challenge on how to do this, download my free 7 days to genius challenge.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go through that, you can practice explaining topics in your own words and let experience create your perspective. You can do this by writing tweets everyday for a year. See what you can learn.\n3) Write 1000+ Words On The Topic\nEvery single piece of content online is based around a personal or professional problem.\nHere\u2019s how you can structure your writing.\nExplain the problem associated with the topic\nTalk about your personal experiences with it\nOptional: give context around the problem\nGive step-by-step actionable advice on how to solve that problem (like this letter)\nActionable advice is how you will build an audience at the start. I wouldn\u2019t worry about being super insightful, that won\u2019t help you grow until people know who you are.\nLike how your favorite YouTuber didn\u2019t start with vlogs. They started with what works, built an audience, then desaturated that market by doing whatever they want. Meaning that you can join in at anytime (this doesn\u2019t only pertain to YouTube).\n4) Sign Up For A Blog & Newsletter Software\nI rarely use fancy sales funnels and it\u2019s rare to see me promote my products on social media anymore.\nI use the 2 hour content ecosystem:\n1 newsletter a week\nThe newsletter is kept on the blog\n1 thread a week from the newsletter\n3 tweets a day from the newsletter topic\nPeople that only tweet have little authority and have trouble making sales and landing clients.\nAuthority comes from 1 of 2 things: depth or expertise.\nLong form content is where the money is made. Not with tweets and social media promotions.\nFor the sake of simplicity, I would sign up for Beehiiv, Revue, or Substack. We aren\u2019t looking for fancy automations yet. All we want is a software that can send a newsletter, collect emails, and backlog that newsletter as a blog post (crucial point that no-one takes advantage of) so we can plug those as mini-salesmen or individual lead magnets under our other content.\n5) Repurpose The Actionable Section Of The Newsletter\nWe know that actionable step-by-step advice is the most beginner friendly and potent tool for social growth. If you don\u2019t know how to grow, chances are that you are trying to be too clever and insightful from the start \u2014 when all you need to do is give actionable advice related to your talking point (and pair it with step 6 of this newsletter).\nPair actionable advice with a Twitter thread and you have the potential to gain 100-1000 followers your first time around. I see this happen all the time.\nHow do we make this easy?\nTurn the actionable section of the newsletter you wrote into a Twitter thread. Simple as that. I show you exactly how in my new course, 2 Hour Writer, to make sure that it is written for maximum impact.\n6) Learn How To Network & Grow On The Platform\nWhen you start playing a game, you don\u2019t just dive in and start playing. You\u2019ll have no idea what you are doing, get angry, and quit.\nThe reason you\u2019ve tried and failed at growing on different social platforms is because you think it is as simple as posting good content. Not in the slightest.\nYou grow on social media platforms by getting more eyes on your profile. How do you do that?\nPeople sharing your content to their audience\nNetworking with similar follower accounts and growing together\nCommenting on larger accounts posts so people can see your comments and click to your account\nMake your long form content (newsletter) so good that people can\u2019t help but talk about it\nJoin a community (like Modern Mastery) to meet people that are on the same path as you.\nOptional but less taboo than you think: paying big accounts for shares (retweets, story shares on Instagram, or even something as simple as a comment because that still exposes your content to their audience).\nOf course, you still need to have good content and an optimized profile if you want people to follow you.\nIt\u2019s called social media for a reason. You have to interact with others, make friends, and help each other grow.\nYou can do without this, but it will be painstakingly slow and you\u2019ll turn into one of those accounts that just whines all day about how social growth is unfair. Don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game.\n7) Turn Ideas Into Impactful Tweets\nFrom your newsletters and threads, your mind should be flooded with tweet ideas. Tweets are short and punchy writing that get people to react.\nMy favorite way of writing tweets is with the framework I developed: PPP\nPull\nPerspective\nPunchline\nPull them in with something that catches attention (like a number or percentage), give a unique perspective that came from personal experience and critical thought, and wrap it all up in a way that makes sense.\nPerspective and punchline often tie into one another, usually in one-liners like this:\nPeople will spend 10 hours worrying about a task that takes 10 minutes to complete.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) August 8, 2022\nYou can also see this framework separated well in list tweets (use these when you give actionable advice):\nMost people will spend:\n\n8 hours on someone else\u2019s dreams\n4 hours hiding from their own\n2 hours going through the motions\n\n16 hours awake\n24 hours asleep\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to take 40 years and a retirement plan realize that a participation trophy isn\u2019t fulfilling.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) August 8, 2022\nThis is one of many tweet writing methods. Your best bet is to study the accounts you listed in step 1 and follow the Intelligent Imitation process. Emulate their writing as if their tweets were training wheels, dissect why it did well, and try to replicate in your own way.\n8) Develop A Writing System\nThis newsletter goes over everything I would do if I had to start over from zero.\nI wasted 2 years testing sales funnels, different content writing methods, and finding the best way to sustain a high monthly income with writing.\nMy best advice?\nCreate a system from the start and refine it over time. Then, if you want to package it up and sell it in the future, you can. That\u2019s what the one-person business model does. They get results with a system they\u2019ve tested on themselves (to solve their own problem) and then sell it to others \u2014 because by the time the system is perfected, you have ample experience and authority to bank on.\nI use Notion to create systems to make it easy on myself. No other fancy software necessary.\nThese systems can start as step-by-step list of what you need to do on a daily or weekly basis. Then you can start getting fancy with Notions cool features.\n9) Branch Out To Other Platforms\nI overcomplicated this for the longest time.\nI\u2019ve grown to 230K on Instagram, 23K on LinkedIn, and 7K on YouTube with my writing skills.\nI get more engagement than dudes with adonis physiques because my writing hits harder than their chiseled abs.\nAll I do is copy, paste, and record the content that I\u2019ve already written in my newsletters, threads, and tweets. You could even turn your best tweets into TikTok or reel scripts.\nMaster Twitter first, gain some authority, then use your best tweets to break into new platforms (since those ideas are already validated to do well).\nLet\u2019s Recap On How You Can Start Your Writing Business\nWith 1-2 hours a day (considering you have a freelance, consulting, or digital product to sell with the traffic / distribution you are building) you can pull in a higher monthly income than some of the highest paid doctors, without spending a dime on a college degree.\nWe live in an age of authenticity where nobody is authentic. People don\u2019t want professionalism. They want individuality and a sense of belonging with people that \u201cget them.\u201d\nI am nowhere near the best writer, yet I make more than 99% of the writers out there. Funny how that works.\nHere\u2019s a recap of what we went over:\nChoose a topic you can\u2019t shut up about\nBrainstorm a unique perspective you have\nWrite 1000+ words in a structured way\nSign up for a newsletter / blog software and post it\nTurn the actionable section into a viral Twitter thread\nLearn how to network and get eyes on your content\nTurn ideas from your newsletter into tweets and plug your newsletter under it to \u201cread more\u201d (this will grow your email list)\nDevelop a system to make writing take less than 4-6 hours a week\nBranch out to other platforms when you are ready\nLastly, if you have a product or service, you wouldn\u2019t promote it on the timeline.\nThat\u2019s the beauty in this content ecosystem. You build authority with depth in your newsletters, post them as blogs, and plug your offer there.\nNow, you plug relevant newsletters under your tweets and threads everyday. No salesy promotions, no spamming on the timeline. Just perfected social media growth and more sales than any 10 step sales funnel you could build (I\u2019ve tested).\nThe 2 Hour Writer Is Live!\nIf you are a creative or one-person business that wants to:\nImplement the 2 hour content ecosystem for social growth and authority\nGenerate unlimited viral content ideas without templates\nLearn to write in their own unique voice and make their ideas interesting enough to share\nThen check out everything else that is included in the 2 Hour Writer here.\nHope to see you inside!\n\u2014 Dan \u201cyou don\u2019t need an english degree to type words on the internet\u201d Koe"

        "content": "I am absolutely tired of hearing the \u201cjack of all trades, master of none\u201d quote that people use to justify putting themselves in a box. Not only is this perpetuated in the online business or creator space, but in life as a whole. Want a better job? Become a master of the main skill required at that job (instead of the dozens of other skills, traits, and behaviors that are required to become a true master of that skill). As you can tell, I am a fan of a holistic approach to everything. Mind, body, spirit, business.\nGone are the days when it took 10,000 hours to learn \u2014 or master \u2014 a new domain of life. It just doesn\u2019t make sense when you see through the statistic. By not challenging this collective belief you close your mind to the infinite potential that it is capable of.\nI\u2019m not a jack of all trades; I\u2019m a master of many. I don\u2019t feel there is anything I can\u2019t do if I want to. \u2014 Evel Knievel\nJack of all trades, master of all. Anything other line of thought is self-limiting and will seep into your psyche to toy with your emotions like a puppet master.\nLet\u2019s take Leonardo Da Vinci for example. Leo \u2014 as we will call him \u2014 was an architect, sculptor, painter, and is known by the entire world as the greatest artist of the Renaissance era. Riches are in the niches my ass.\nRogan? Gambino? Musk?\nIt seems like the key to all of this is becoming a master of all, but channeling that mastery toward one BIG goal in life.\nThe Dangers of Blurred Perception\nA few weeks ago we talked about the depth behind focus and how it\u2019s not all about deep work \u2014 it\u2019s about every single aspect of your life. Focus, to me, can be synonymous with ordered consciousness, the opposite of chaotic consciousness that leads to \u201cpsychic entropy,\u201d or that the mind tends toward disorder if not focused. This is the difference between certainty and uncertainty. A sense of control or a sense of despair over the outcome of your life. Arguably the key to happiness. It\u2019s time to upgrade the tools of our focus.\nThink of your individual perspective \u2014 or worldview \u2014 as a DSLR camera. The ones that fancy photographers use. The cameras themselves have varied settings and programming that allow them to see the world in front of them. These cameras allow you to attach different lenses that allow for different focal lengths and amount of light that is being received. The cameras also have an \u201cauto\u201d and a \u201cmanual\u201d setting for many different functions, but lets talk about it in relation to focus.\nWhen your lens is blurred, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s on the other side of the blur, you can only assume. You can only tell yourself a story of what\u2019s on the other side. This is perception.\nWhat comprises our worldview \u2014 or perspective \u2014 in reality? Our beliefs, biases, goals, values, vision, and everything else that has been programmed into our heads. The beliefs, biases, etc are not the problems in themselves. A lack of choice and consciousness are the problem. When left unconscious \u2014 or when our camera is left on \u201cauto\u201d mode \u2014 survival comes into play.\n\u201cUntil you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.\u201d \u2014 C.G. Jung\nSurvival is a part of our everyday lives and is an unavoidable function of the human psyche, until we evolve beyond it(?). But when these survival mechanisms are unconscious, what are we trying to survive? The notion of the self. Meaning, we attach to these beliefs and biases and act as if we are them. They become a part of our identity. If something as simple as your unconscious attachment to bodybuilding feels threatened by someones opinion, your focus contracts and your perception blurs. If your identification with becoming jacked and tan gets threatened, you perceive the world from the lens of your survival being at stake.\nThis is a lifelong process of becoming aware of your shadow and integrating it through acceptance and behavior change, but there\u2019s a bigger lesson here:\nWhen your perception is blurred, you cannot see the world for what it is. You will miss out on the learning process that is life itself.\nThis is about learning, and becoming aware of your inaccurate perception is the first step to opening yourself to learning. I am sure we will dive deeper than we already have into this subject, but it feels necessary to bring it to your attention.\nMid Koe Letter reminder: Readers can join Modern Mastery for $5. What\u2019s inside? 180+ proven strategies and personalized help to succeed in life and one-person business ownership.\nOpening Your Mind To The Unknown\nWith blurred perception, you will judge and assume the world around you in a mechanical, automatic fashion. With clear perception, you will observe and discern in an open and conscious fashion. That is the message with all of this. If you are trying to learn business, but are so focused on the wrong aspects of business because you have a poor, attached relationship with money\u2026 you will be scratching your head wondering why everyone else is making twice as much progress with half the brains.\nWe\u2019ve discussed the concept of the unknown \u2014 the land of infinite potential \u2014 many times before. This time is no different. The Unknown, in this context, is seeing reality for what it is. That is, being open to what our everyday consciousness leaves out due to our conditioned perceptions. This stems far beyond clearing your own lens. It means being able to throw your lens away completely and being open to seeing through any lens. Some know this as empathy and I don\u2019t want to get it twisted. We are simply being open here to start. Assumptions and judgements while trying to adopt other\u2019s perspectives seems against the point. Be open to the moment as it arises, as that\u2019s what it is, a happening.\nPerception is selective. Right now, think, what are you focusing on? The words on this screen. But what allows the words to be? The white space behind it. Like how a song is a series of noises, but without spaces of silence, without lows to the highs, without slow to the fast, it wouldn\u2019t be a song\u2026 it would be a long screech. As is the Universe. Uni = one. Verse = song.\nLet\u2019s apply.\nThe Meta Skill Of Meta Skills\nLearning is a foundational human drive. What do we do from the second we are born? Learn. How else would we end up in the position we are in now? The problem is that we have been conditioned into seeing a one-dimensional way of life. A shallow existence without depth. Study this, ignore that. Write this way, not that way. Follow these goals, not your own. Do as I say, not as you say.\nThis has caused a polarization of human consciousness itself. Low consciousness, high unconsciousness. What is going under your nose and how is that preventing you from getting the most out of life? We are taking a very broad approach to learning here. Life is our context. But as with most things I talk about that reflect universal laws, it can be applied to any dimension. Macro or micro.\nHere are 5 steps to 10x your learning in any reality you choose: personal, cultural, social, universal, situational, conversational\u2026 any.\n1) Open Your Mind\nThis is a given. How can you learn if your mind is closed to learning itself? This, of course, will take time and practice as with anything good in life.\nI like to think of this in terms of the social media comment section. When someone with a lot of followers makes a post \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter what it is \u2014 the comments fall into 4 different camps:\nThose that ask questions out of curiosity (open mind)\nThose that react based off of what they perceive, not seeing beyond what was said (closed mind)\nThose that reply for the sake of siphoning followers (business)\nThose that are encouraging or just reply with an emoji (good people)\nThe first is open to learning. However that leads to another problem which we discuss in point two. The second, through lack of self-awareness and a puzzling desire to not enjoy themselves, see what they see and use what they know to spark an argument.\nI don\u2019t have to tell you the problem with this. If I tell you that you can make $1M as a one-person business, what\u2019s your reaction? Is it \u201cimpossible\u201d because you haven\u2019t been exposed to that potential reality? Is the logical solution to close your mind to it forever and hide in the comfortable reality you\u2019ve trapped yourself in?\nThis is one thing that truly gets on my nerves when on socials (working on it) but why are you even on social media or living if not to make the most of it? In reflection, one of my goals has always been to prove people wrong. Good or bad, it has led to in depth newsletters, courses, and other content because I cannot stop learning about how to prove limiting perspectives (and myself) wrong.\n2) Environment Immersion\nWhen you are open to learning, it would be silly to rely on any given person to provide all of the material for you. With the social media example, let\u2019s picture that someone made an educational post on getting six pack abs. You can already here the closed-mindedness and limiting beliefs.\n\u201cLol you think that everyone can just lose weight???\u201d\n\u201cIntermittent fasting? That\u2019s idiotic, we\u2019ve been eating breakfast for centuries!\u201d\n\u201cRaw beef liver is the most nutrient dense food on the planet? Wow, don\u2019t care either way.\u201d\nWhile I have no ties to these things (for those wondering if I still eat raw liver, no) closing your mind to just one thing closes your mind from branching into other pathways for something that may be conducive to a better future. Opening your mind to intermittent fasting \u2014 as an example \u2014 gives you a new perspective to open your mind further. Through perspective collection, you can connect the dots and create a solution for your health that is perfectly tailored to you.\nThose that are open to improving their health after seeing that post can go one of two routes:\nStart asking the creator for all of the answers, expecting 5 books worth of information from somebody who has their own priorities\nTake it as their responsibility to educate themselves in a domain that will improve their life.\nIn the second case, environment immersion is the answer. In essence, this means controlling or framing your focus to be exposed to information relating to the desired outcome. Following social media accounts that are giving different perspectives. Buying books, listening to podcasts, talking to your health nut friends, signing up for classes, or anything else within your power to become immersed in the environment that will seemingly overload you with information.\nTo prevent overload, practice detachment and critical thinking. Do not take any advice as law. Yes, even mine. I am simply a perspective in infinity.\n3) Silent Observation\nI just got back to Arizona yesterday afternoon. After driving for 10 hours 2 days in a row, it was a given that I had to catch up on steps, so I went on a ~2 hour walk to explore the city. The novelty of the shops paired with the intention to learn where I would want to walk on a daily basis, I learned quite quick.\nSilent observation is about keeping your mind open to learning. It can be easy to \u201cshut down\u201d after you feel like you\u2019ve learned everything. Our mind is tricky. It likes to latch onto the ideas that best serve the ego.\nIf I hear diet advice online that is perfectly marketed to me, I could easily accept it as law, test it out, see good results, and feel like that is the best option for everyone \u2014 when it may not even be the best option for me!\n4) Connect The Dots\nThe Law of Use.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it.\u201d\nThere is a reason everyone and their mother is screaming at the top of their lungs for you to take action. Why, you ask?\nBecause you do not learn a single thing if you don\u2019t. If you do not solidify your findings with direct experience and go on to teach someone, you are spreading a lie. You are parroting what someone else said. You are acting out a robotic life giving advice that you haven\u2019t implemented yourself. This is more of a disservice to you than it is the person you are giving the advice.\nThere are more ways than physical to take action. You can write, think, meditate, and use other methods depending on what it is that you learned.\nWhen you Use what you learn, you are forced to do it in your own way. You will face resistance until you breakthrough. When everything \u201cclicks\u201d and you have that \u201caha!\u201d moment, you will feel the dopamine levels in your brain increase. You will feel the excitement.\nThis phenomenon will continue happening as long as you are immersed in an environment and using what you learn. That is why I write so much \u2014 because I enjoy consuming information that I want to learn more about. I treat my mind, body, and business as a science project. I implement fast and reap the neurobiological benefits of doing so.\n5) Stack Experience\nWith an open mind, conducive environment, clear observation, and dots being connected \u2014 your learning will compound. It is incredible how fast you can learn when you don\u2019t latch on to specific beliefs.\nComplexity is the result of two broad psychological processes: differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas and entities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combining these opposite tendencies. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nWith time, your life XP will continue increasing. Your self will become more complex. You will start to enjoy life more because you don\u2019t feel the need to defend your own perspective \u2014 because you know there are infinite other perspectives out there. Latching onto one is the cause of suffering.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nI just got back to AZ and will be getting back on the YouTube schedule soon.

        "content": "I\u2019ve always had some form of aversion toward Western work culture.\n80-hour work weeks.\nHigh-pressure environments.\nLittle time for rest and recovery.\nIt never seemed \u201cright\u201d to me.\nWhy would I want to waste my entire day, knowing that 2-3 hours in my work quality would suffer?\nThis has been a talking point for a long time now. I believe it has started to shape the creator economy and remote work.\n4-hour workdays, singular focus, and meaningful work are becoming the norm in our little pocket of Twitter \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. We are creating a future of passionate individuals that produce world-shifting creations.\nAncient Romans, Ancient Greeks, Steve Jobs, Charles Darwin, and an infinite list of visionaries, strategists, and innovators attributed their success to surprisingly low \u201cwork\u201d times.\nWriters from multiple domains, like Hemingway and Tarantino, would spend the majority of their days lounging by the pool, spitting game with girls, and doing everything aside from what they deemed \u201cwork.\u201d\nWhy?\nI. The Paradox Of Productivity\n\u201cThe clever man may work smarter, not harder, they say, but the creative man doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d \u2014 Alex Soojung-Kim Pang\nFor those that are like me and love the gym (or any kind of exercise), you understand the importance of rest and recovery.\nImagine going to the gym for 8 hours trying to be as \u201cproductive\u201d as possible. You would try to max out on main exercises like the nervous system taxing deadlift, then go on to do accessory movements. In one day, you would run out of exercises to do. You may even opt to go on a run just because your boss told you to.\nWould you be able to come back and give it your all the next day? How about 5 days in a row? Would you be able to tough it out until you can use your paid vacation time to recover and do it all over again?\nYour body would be decimated.\nInstead, we go to the gym for 45-90 minutes at a time. We push ourselves at the expense of physical energy. We create a routine and schedule it into our days so we can prioritize rest, recovery, and general quality of life (because we have other parts of life to explore.)\nWhile corporate culture is handing you a pretty paycheck to incentivize sustained intensity, we must push back.\nIntensity isn\u2019t sustainable. It\u2019s not rocket science. Sustainability, consistency, and creativity must be prioritized before we even mention the word \u201cproductivity.\u201d\nII. The Fill \u2013 Empty \u2013 Use Framework For Sustainable Productivity & Creativity\nNow, this framework can be used by anybody but is best used by those that are in the creator space. Knowledge workers, consciousness workers, marketers, creatives, and the rest as opposed to manual labor jobs. Those that are creating value with their mind and post their findings, perspectives, and creations from the depths of their study online.\nThis letter will be dedicated to understanding the depth behind a tweet I wrote a while back.\nFill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization\n\nEmpty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation\n\nUse your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 5, 2021\nThis letter is also assuming that you understand the importance of meeting your basic needs. Your psyche is wired for survival. If you have attachments to the external world \u2014 relationships of any form \u2014 that threaten your identity when the relationship is challenged, then you will not be able to act authentically. That is to say, you will have difficulty opening your mind to reality to leverage nature. Your attachments \u2014 or perceived needs \u2014 will act as obstructions that slow the flow of your productive and creative energy.\nYou cannot be your true, authentic self if you need something that you do not already have.\nAuthenticity and openness is the key to all of this.\nBefore we jump in, a gentle reminder that Koe Letter readers can join Modern Mastery for $5 \u2014 a community dedicated to one-person businesses, personal development, lifestyle design, and the depth that comes along with that.\nII.I. Fill Your Mind\nWe set the scene in the afternoon, not the morning, why? First, personal preference. Second, because this approach is holistic. Deep work hacks that only mention the time \u2014 usually morning \u2014 in which it\u2019s time to be productive will always fail. Productivity and creativity are not one time things, they are modes of being.\nIt is not a matter of deep work. It is a matter of the balance and degree of which you engage in deep play, deep rest, and lastly deep work.\nFor value creators, those that intend to put good out into the world, you must adopt the habit of conscious study. Without expanding your worldview, mind, and knowledge through exposing yourself to novel perspectives; how do you plan to create? Creativity, in some aspects, is about pulling from multiple sources and mashing them together. Like deconstructing a topic, learning about its parts through study, and building your own creation like you would playing with legos as a kid.\nWhen aligned with your vision, values, and goals you can consume information with the intention to understand and apply. This can begin to act as a vessel for raising your consciousness. You start to gain clarity on your life\u2019s work through exposure to the information that aligns with you the most. If you don\u2019t know where to start, re-read the book that changed the way you think, it will do it again.\nMy favorite way of doing this comes in 2 parts:\n1) Listening On A Walk\nI go on multiple walks throughout the day. Once in the morning, once after my work sessions, and once in the evenings. Not only is this crucial for sleep (see: circadian rhythm and sunlight) it has a multitude of other benefits.\nIt is quite nice to have an office and even nicer to have a warm, well-furnished home. But my mind often comes to a standstill after some hours indoors. So I take a walk. Once outside, my mind immediately begins to move freely and instinctively over my subject. Ideas come rushing to my mind, without being called. Soon enough, the best answer emerges from the jumble. I realize what I can do, what I should do, and what I must abandon. \u2014 Eugene Wigner\nAside from movement and exercise being great for your health, there is something unique about walks. Ancient masters swore by it, industry leaders took them religiously, and the world\u2019s most respected creatives made them a part of their everyday routine \u2014 I have noticed immense benefits myself.\nWhen I pop in an audiobook, lecture, or video with the intention of applying what I learn to my current project (like a newsletter, tweet, module, or anything else that comes from having a personal brand as your consciousness work vessel) the ideas flow in a steady stream. From subconscious to conscious.\nI pick up gold nuggets here and there from what I am consuming, but the real magic happens when I hear the right word that triggers a waterfall of insight. I\u2019m not sure what the phenomenon is, but sometimes you just need that one word, letter, sound, example, anecdote, or story to bring up a thought that leads you down a rabbit hole of questioning and exploration.\nWalks are how I do my best work, as they are a necessity for creativity. Being a writer, I can get 80% of my work done by generating ideas, outlining, and writing on my phone while on a walk. Hence why my unique process is bundled up inside The 2 Hour Writer.\n2) Reading In The Sun\nAnother reason I love walks is that they act as creativity time blocks. When you get out of the house you become less prone to familiar distractions that will impact your study just by being in that environment. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you try to block out the distractions. You know they are there and they will occupy creative energy.\nThe same goes for going out in the sun. I\u2019ve tried reading on walks but I end up tripping and getting hit in the head with tree branches (being 6\u20195\u2033 does come with it\u2019s downsides)!\nHeading out to my apartment pool with my Kindle and a bottle of San Pellegrino allows me to block out time specifically for reading. Reading \u2014 as opposed to listening \u2014 allows me focus my attention and study deeper. I can highlight ideas that I want to contemplate over the coming weeks and months for the sake of understanding.\nFilling your mind can be done at any time, and may be scattered throughout your day, but for the sake your own experimentation and clarity; start with doing this in the afternoons. If you do not have time to do this in the afternoon, sprinkle it throughout your day. I will give personal examples below.\nIf you are unsure what to study, how to capture ideas, and want to develop your ability to learn a subject with speed and ease \u2014 download my free 7 day creative challenge.\nII.II. Empty Your Mind\nIn psychology, there is something called the Default Mode Network. From the book Rest, the DMN is \u201ca series of interconnected sections that activate as soon as people stop concentrating on external tasks, and shifts from outward-focused to inward-focused cognition.\u201d\nWhen \u201cactivated\u201d through restful, meditative, or open activities the brain is not any less active than it would be when engaged in something like focused work, or something that demands narrow focus and concentrated attention.\nThis can be associated with presence, surrender, and divine inspiration. When your focus is open, your subconscious mind is still working hard and munching on problems. Many programmers understand this well. They will often work on a project, encounter a bug, struggle to fix it, \u201cgive up,\u201d and go about their day. At the most unexpected time, the perfect solution will pop into their head and the excited programmer will rush to open their code base to test it out. Shower thoughts is another example of this.\nFrom personal experience, the greatest insights come after a period of struggle. My attention engaged with the natural battle raging in my head to the point of seeing its pointlessness. When you are hyper-focused on a problem in your life, the best way to solve it is counterintuitive. Letting go \u2014 surrendering, that is \u2014 and engaging with life itself will bring the answer to mind. Have faith \ud83d\ude09\nEmpty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend. \u2014 Bruce Lee\nEveryone should be familiar with that quote, but how do you empty your mind?\nBy immersing yourself in the present moment. Flowing with the river of life and the highs and lows that it presents.\nThere are many ways to make this easier on you to grasp, but understand that all of these means lead to the same end. A few ways you can practice immersing yourself in the present moment:\n1) The Gym\nGym bros talk a lot about \u201cmind-muscle connection\u201d and other things that are just short for anchoring your attention in the present. When you are at the gym, be a silent observer. Observe the voice in your head that tells you to quit. Observe how the muscle feels as it contracts. Observe the blood flowing quicker through your body.\nThis works for any exercise, not only the gym. Elevated bodily functions that are easily observable makes it easier to treat the gym as a meditation practice.\n2) Nature Bathing\nWhat better way to tap into the source than Source itself?\nFrom a psychological lens, nature presents the perfect formula for flow. On a hike, you order your consciousness by having a vision of how you want the hike to go. You construct a hierarchy of goals in your mind that allow you to gain clarity on the climb. You may have a water intake goal, distance goal, health goal, or just the goal to have a good time in nature. Intention.\nFrom there, you begin your ascent up the trail and are faced with a challenge. Is the challenge too difficult to the point it upsets you or makes you latch on to negative thoughts about not reaching your vision? Or maybe the challenge is too easy and it disappoints you. Even better, you planned the hike to match your skill level and you don\u2019t have to incessantly think. Hiking becomes an art form and you kick into flow.\n3) Other Meditative Habits You Can Adopt\nConscious meditation (obviously), conscious walks, conscious listening during conversation, conscious writing, conscious creating \u2014 can you start to see the picture I am painting here?\nWork when it\u2019s time to work.\n\nRest when it\u2019s time to rest.\n\nPlay when it\u2019s time to play.\n\nWhen immersed in the present moment, there is no difference.\n\nLive when it's time to live.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) July 3, 2022\nThere is a big problem in self-help that everyone is prone to, myself included. When you are just starting out, and even when you are deep into the space, you are just doing the activities that people tell you to do. Most people are meditating unconsciously, which is a funny example. They are mechanically going through the motions because it has become habitual. They aren\u2019t getting the benefits they would get if they simply prioritized consciousness at any given moment \u2014 not just during meditation.\nThe best way I can explain consciousness in this context is by understanding relativism. Everything that is not absolute truth (unknowable or unspeakable with words alone) is relative. Relative means that there is a relationship. Cause and effect. Polarity. One thing cannot exist without the other. During meditation, can you follow a thought to another thought to an event until the lines are blurred and you glimpse into Infinity?\nWhen you are writing, can you spot the gaps in your understanding? Can you bust through \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d by following a paragraph and becoming conscious of what is missing? Can you see how I am weaving in concepts into this article and connecting them with other concepts that are seemingly unrelated but they aren\u2019t because everything is relative?\nAs a note, that is the secret to my writing. I choose a topic that I know and fill in the blanks in a way that I understand it according to my direct experience. Stream of consciousness, then edit. If you can\u2019t tap into an infinite stream of consciousness, question why. Questioning shines the light of awareness onto resistance and allows it to dissipate.\n4) Physical Mediums\nAnother way to order consciousness or create clarity is to express the unorganized thoughts that are in your head. This is done through writing or speaking.\nMy favorite method was shown to me by my good friend Joey Justice. That method is brain dump journaling. How do you brain dump journal? First, by writing out every single thing that you can bring your attention to in your mind. Once you have all thoughts, reactions to feelings, emotions, and tasks written in chaotic fashion on your paper \u2014 you can start to organize them.\nThis is where connections are made and clarity is gained. You can organize the entities on your page into specific categories, potential projects, deep work priorities, and any other relationship that can be made by the connection of your brain dump.\nNot only will this quiet your mind and prepare you for sleep \u2014 which is why I enjoy doing it at night \u2014 it can be used as an intentional planning session for the months, weeks, or days ahead.\nBy taking your attention off work and placing it on life, the gap between the two dissipates and The Unknown will deliver the insight you were looking for to the forefront of your conscious mind.\nThis aspect is also baked into my work as a writer, I just choose to do it online so I can do it for a living. By treating social media as a \u201cpublic journal,\u201d I kill two birds with one stone.\nII.III. Use Your Mind\nI\u2019ve talked about focused work a lot. I\u2019ve also talked about the depth behind focus, that most humans glance over, even when it is the main thing that separates us from other beings.\nUsing your mind comes last as we have filled and emptied our mind. By filling our mind we have expanded it, broadening our awareness and allowing The Law of Inspired Action to come into play. This gives us fresh creative firepower for when we use our mind. By emptying our mind we have allowed the Default Mode Network to come into play. Our subconscious mind will deliver insight to our conscious mind and we can order said consciousness through brain dump journaling.\nThere are 3 main things that come into play when getting into deep, focused work:\nLeveraged familiarity\nOrdered consciousness\nConnection to The Unknown\nWe have checked some of these boxes already \u2014 like ordering consciousness with journaling \u2014 but everything serves a different purpose under different contexts. Our goal with focused work is to eliminate distractions, get into flow, and produce quality work in the short amount of time that our finite creative energy allows.\nLeveraged familiarity is a soft morning routine. The human brain loves to conserve the energy wasted on familiar things. Hence why habit formation is so popular, like putting certain and preferably beneficial aspects of your life on autopilot. As with most things, there is depth to the term habits. There are mental, emotional, physical, and financial habits that could each be broken down even further to take a peek into how robotic we truly are in our unconscious lives.\nLeveraged familiarity is just that. Being conscious that your morning routine is familiar and remaining connected to The Unknown or infinity throughout by being conscious of your direct experience. For my Tolle fans, and in simple terms, this means being in the Now \u2014 as you can only \u201cknow\u201d what you can project on reality from the familiar past or potential future.\nOrdered consciousness comes into play with your routine. Having a familiar wake-up time, work environment, and little friction when it comes time to work is key for preserving creative energy. If you have not already planned your morning out with your nightly brain dump, you can set an ideal yet challenging outcome for your work and 2-3 priority tasks that will move the needle towards that outcome. When this micro hierarchy of goals is aligned with the macro \u2014 your life\u2019s vision and goals \u2014 the flow state should come seamlessly.\nThere are 3 steps to unlocking deep focus\n\n1. Goal (direction)\n2. Plan (clarity)\n3. Reduced friction (action)\n\nA desired outcome + knowing how to get there + simple execution will put you into a distraction-numbing state of flow.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) January 25, 2022\nTake a few deep breaths, assume that you know nothing, and start working.\nMy Daily Routine For Inspiration & Self-Experimentation\nLike Charles Darwin, I like to split my focused work blocks with long walks. I start my mornings with a long 45-minute walk without my phone. I focus on my breath, body, and other sensations that I bring my attention to. My intention with this is to ground myself in \u2018not knowing\u2019 before it\u2019s time to work. Sometimes, I\u2019ll read a bit from Kindle on my phone if I spot a welcoming bench on my walk.\nAfter that walk, I head to my local coffee shop about 10 minutes up the road. I\u2019ll ask for my typical hot Americano, snap a pic for my Instagram stories, then block out anything and everything that could distract me from my writing. I throw my AirPods in (despite the dreaded EMF frequencies!), put on music that will help me channel a specific energy into my writing, and allow my writing to dance between the known and Unknown.\nAfter 2-3 forty-five-minute work blocks \u2014 with a bathroom break in between \u2014 I\u2019ll walk back home to eat. I like \u201cfasting\u201d for a minimal time while working. I\u2019ve always been more clear-headed on an empty stomach. After eating, I\u2019ll either go to the gym or head out on another long walk. This time I listen to an audiobook or lecture to expand my mind. I double this as consciousness work by paying close attention to the words permeating my ears and allowing my curiosity to open up new mental pathways through questioning.\nWhen noon hits, my day is mostly won. If I have to catch up on some writing (like I am right now at 5pm to finish this before the morning) then I will. Otherwise, I am reading, socializing, running errands, or entertaining myself in other mediums \u2014 I do enjoy some good old Netflix.\nCome bedtime, I\u2019ll pull out my notebook and write down everything that comes to my mind. Morning priorities? Check. Self-reflection? Check. Alignment with goals? Check. Immense mental clarity? Check. With so much purpose and depth behind something as simple as a journaling practice, I look forward to these parts of my days. These are often the times where I learn the most about myself, and therefore, learn the most about the world.\nAll in all my routine may seem similar to others. The difference is depth of consciousness that has been cultivated over time. If you ask anyone else why they walk so much, they may not be able to give you an arsenal of 10+ different \u201cwhys\u201d as to why they are walking that much. Every aspect of this lifestyle was designed with intention. I hope that you can pull inspiration from my experience, experiment with it, and become directly conscious of modalities of being that will increase your quality of life.\nIf you enjoyed this letter, I\u2019d love to hear about it. Just hit reply and let me know what it was that made you think a bit deeper than usual.\n\u2014 Dan \u201cSometimes I make sense\u201d Koe"

That\u2019s all it is. Money is the result of value exchange. Offer to solve someone\u2019s problems for money in the areas you know best.\nThe limits that come along with employment cease to exist when you start taking the internet seriously.\nMost of us \u201conline business folk\u201d refrain from talking about making a lot of money because that\u2019s what most people\u2019s lives revolve around.\nI think more people need to talk about money. Normalize it. Condition people into believing that they can earn as much as they want doing what they want. As cheesy as it sounds, self-belief is the first step in almost anything.\nThought comes before action.\nThe Experience Model\nThis can be as easy or as difficult as you can make it.\nForget about finding a niche. I\u2019ve seen hundreds of business beginners quit because they think that the niche they chose is the problem.\nChoose 2-3 curiosities to pursue that have the potential to solve your own problems.\nImmerse yourself in an informational and social environment conducive to solving those problems.\nRead books, follow people online, and eliminate everything else that has the potential to distract you.\nTreat your Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn account as a place for sharing your discoveries and talking about your interests in a persuasive way (study persuasion, influence, and marketing).\nThat is your niche. YOU are your niche. YOU, at this very moment, are interested in a select few things that intersect. That intersection is where your audience is built.\nSince I am interested in the book Rest, my niche are those that want to decrease their work times, produce higher quality work, and enjoy the entirety of their lives. See how that works?\nPeople are interested in more than one thing.\nThose that are interested in health can also express interest in spirituality or learning to code. That\u2019s where the fun comes in \u2014 it\u2019s on you to craft a persuasive argument for the interests that will help others solve their problems.\nAs you evolve, your content and brand will evolve.\nThat means you will move on from what you are currently talking about and selling.\nYou will desaturate the market beneath you.\nThe creator economy is impossible to saturate, otherwise it\u2019s not the creator economy (one-person businesses).\nHuman connection cannot scale.\nIf you want to build a billion-dollar company, then yes stick to one thing, but that\u2019s not what I want\u2026 and I would argue 99% of people don\u2019t actually want that.\nGive me $1M a year and complete personal freedom. I\u2019ll be good.\nAt the moment, the creator economy + one-person business model seems to sustainably provide this.\nHow do you evolve? By solving your own problems.\nAll of this is so simple. It just takes people a bit of time trying to find the complex answer before they realize it.\nI didn\u2019t like freelancing. It took up too much of my time and I disliked working on projects that weren\u2019t my own.\nThats a problem I can solve, write about, and start to teach\u2026 see how this goes?\nI had to evolve, so I started writing on Twitter, built a product, and decreased my time on client work.\nTime to evolve again, I built a new brand consulting offer, charged more, productized certain aspects of it, and hit my first $50K month.\nI wanted to maintain that income as a baseline and decrease my work times to 2-4 hours in the morning \u2014 so I evolved yet again, built Modern Mastery, and once again reduced client work.\nTo most freelancers and B2B agencies this would be impossible to accomplish.\nIf you are one of them, the best thing you can do is build leverage by writing online.\nGet out of the B2B space if you are dead set on living a life of self-reliance, fulfillment, and meaning.\nJoin the C2C (creator to creator) space that is continuing to grow, almost exponentially.\nFlow with the current that few can see without being in the space.\nFlow with the shift from societal constructs and big business to individual education systems (social media and authentic products) and one-person businesses with media (writing) as the backbone of your success.\nThe Experience Paradox\nLike a crappy job posting that you feel unqualified for:\nYou need experience to start, but you gain experience by starting.\nMost of what you are told you can\u2019t do is an illusion. You take it as law and impose limits on yourself.\nLet me make it easy for you.\nBlock out all advice you hear about building an online brand until you execute on this and figure it out for yourself:\nTreat Twitter (a writing platform) as a public journal.\nPost your thoughts, ideas, beliefs, likes, and dislikes\nSpeak to yourself. Give your current self the advice it needs to here and your past self advice it wish it had heard.\nStudy your curiosities and share what you learn\nActively improve your life and share the lessons and insights you came across\nPursue your purpose, document how you solve your problems, and offer to help others in exchange for money\nIt is an incredibly difficult journey.\nYou will have many mental battles. Write your way through them.\nYou will have many personal battles. Write your way through them.\nBut what else would you expect?\nA comfy, limited, job handing you a paycheck every 2 weeks in exchange for 80% of your waking hours?\nNo thanks. Sounds even more difficult than the former.\nYour survival-wired psyche will thank you with good dopamine by pursuing your vision, goals, and hunting for its survival on a daily basis.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nThe July 21st Masters curriculum enrollment ends in 5 days.

        "id": 85,
        "heading": "How To Master Your Focus",
        "content": "One of my favorite books is The Way Of The Superior Man by David Deida.\nDavid has some transformative ideas on modern masculinity. He brings a unique light to the misconceptions surrounding it and a spiritual approach to relationships. My favorite aspect of David? His writing.\nThere\u2019s something different about it. Some of it doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 yet it still makes sense. You can tell that Deida isn\u2019t writing from his mind, he\u2019s writing from his heart. He isn\u2019t only talking the spiritual talk, he is walking (or writing) the spiritual walk.\nHe is channeling from his deepest source by immersing himself in the present moment. Connected to the infinite, God, the universe, a higher intelligence\u2026 fully conscious. Deida is writing while hovering a few feet off the material ground. He is painting a picture. He is \u201cshowing, not telling.\u201d He is attempting to explain his present, direct experience by explaining what it is like, not what it is.\nThis has taught me a lot about writing in itself. I write my best when I can sit down, no distractions, present, and speak in words that may not make sense to the unconscious eye.\nLittle thought. From source to screen.\nWhat hold\u2019s people back from reaching this state? I\u2019ll let Watts set the scene.\nHuman consciousness is at the same time as being a form of awareness and sensitivity and understanding it\u2019s also a form of ignorance.\nThe ordinary everyday consciousness that we have leaves out more than it takes in.\nAnd because of this, it leaves out things that are terribly important.\nIt leaves out things that would if we did know them, allay our anxieties and fears and horrors. And if we could extend our awareness you see to include those things that we leave out we would have a deep interior piece because we would all know the one thing that you mustn\u2019t know\u2026 what is profound, what is mysterious, what is in the depths.\n\u2014 Alan Watts\nLike Deida, Watts is describing what he sees in these \u201cdepths\u201d of human consciousness.\nLet\u2019s discuss. Maybe this can make all of us better writers (and open us up to a new dimension of human life.)\nWarning: This is going to be one of my more spiritual or philosophical letters. I would encourage you to read through it with an open mind and curiosity to understand.\nThe Focus Matrix\nI am writing my book, The Art Of Focus, to expose people to the depths of something we don\u2019t appreciate enough, focus.\nFocus is vastly misunderstood for this exact reason.\nPeople only see it from a surface level and decided to leave it at that. Most people \u2014 especially those in the self-improvement space \u2014 see it as a once-in-a-while tool for deep work.\nIn reality, focus is the entirety of our lives.\nYou'd be surprised how much you can get done with 1 hour of uninterrupted focus.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 25, 2022\nLearning how to get into deep, focused work is an incredible way to introduce yourself to the power of harnessing attention.\nYou can get 8 hours of work done in 2.\nYou can utilize the finite energy you have in the day.\nYou can make a habit out of making massive progress on your goals.\nWe\u2019ve talked about all this before (and to be frank, the focused work is getting a tad repetitive on social media).\nBut that\u2019s not what I meant by the tweet above. It has nothing to do with focused work\u2026 yet everything to do with \u201cfocused work.\u201d\nLet\u2019s dive deeper.\nFocus, in my definition, is conscious attention.\nConsciousness is the essence of the human experience.\nAttention is how we process information within the infinite realm of consciousness.\nFocus is how you maneuver your attention to navigate reality towards optimal outcomes.\nIn my book, I present an argument for what I call The 3 Pillars.\nThis is the overarching meta concept that I conduct my life by.\nI: Focus\nYour vision, purpose, hierarchy of goals (mission), and priority actions are focus anchors. These \u201canchors\u201d must be cultivated, refined, and revisited to give you consistent intrinsic energy.\nII: Energy\nNow that you have something of importance to dedicate your time and attention to, everything else must follow suit. All inputs. Food, thoughts, money, information, etc. Every stimuli you encounter either aids your future (that includes collective impact) or it is ignored.\nYou can expand, contract, narrow, or widen your focus on these specific entities to \u201ctap in\u201d to their level of energy. If a negative thought pops into your head, you can transmute that negative thought into a positive experience through polar thinking.\nIII: Experience\nWith accurate focus and an open energy channel, you conduct yourself from your direct conscious experience right now. That is, you anchor your focus to the present moment. While connected to source, you \u201cgive your gift\u201d or \u201cfuck the world\u201d as Deida would say with your full ability. Nothing held back. Impacting the minds and hearts of the world, thus impacting the collective mind and heart.\nThink of this in the aspect of writing or communication. Deida is \u201cgiving his gift\u201d fully in the present moment in his writing. He encourages you to give your gift fully while communicating and interacting with the world.\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg of course. It is taking an entire book to explain. For those wondering, it will be dropping sometime next year. I am in no rush.\nFocal contraction and expansion is how you live a life of meaning, enjoyment, and progress. It is an art form. No matter how \u201cnegative\u201d the situation is to the untrained eye. All Is Mind.\nNarrow, unconscious focus leads to stress, anxiety, reactivity, and annoyance.\nWhen you find yourself projecting into the predictable future, it is easy to narrow your focus on a stressful upcoming situation and pull that future experience into your present experience.\nOpen, unconscious focus leads to feeling lost and overwhelmed with where your life is headed.\nThere are tasks, goals, and life outcomes that trigger thoughts, emotion, and experience unless caught by the watcher.\nConscious focus \u2014 both narrow and open \u2014 have an entire lifetime of use cases, but I want to focus on one that has radically transformed the way I navigate relaity:\nDepth, appreciation, and love.\nDon\u2019t worry, I used to be the guy that would cringe at all of the \u201cgood vibes only\u201d lingo. For the rest of this letter I want you to set your labels, judgements, and reactions aside. Open your mind beyond words as I challenge the way you think for a bit.\nMid Koe Letter reminder: readers can join Modern Mastery for $5 here. MM contains 170+ life and business strategies, live trainings, and step-by-step roadmaps from people who have built sustainable and passionate one-person businesses.\nInfinite Consciousness\nThere is one thing that separates human beings the most from other species:\nDepth of focus.\nExpansion and contraction.\nExpansion being a large area of attention.\nContraction being a small area of attention.\nLike a circle that gets larger and smaller depending on what you are directly conscious of.\nFocus is the most important skill that has flown under people\u2019s noses.\nIt isn\u2019t tangible. It isn\u2019t material. It is near impossible to pinpoint the exact state of your focus. You can\u2019t quantify it.\nFor that reason, and multiple reasons we have discussed before, the majority of the human population are asleep. Living out pre-programmed unconscious lives. Habitual actions, thought patterns, emotional reactions, and decisions that result in their direct experience in this present moment.\nConscious living is another layer deeper. Through practice, you enjoy life in an entirely new dimension. You begin to see this world from another dimension.\nWhat is stopping people from tapping in to this new dimension?\nThink of the tip of an iceberg.\nIt sits above the surface of the water.\nNow imagine that iceberg as anything you were to come in contact with in reality. Infinite icebergs that create the fabric of reality.\nA thought, emotion, phone, glass, plant, computer, word, letter, design, social media profile, tattoo, keyboard, key, shirt, belt, button, room, cloud, chair, smell, or anything else you can become directly conscious of through your sensory experience.\nThis is how most people conduct their lives. They see what they see (or feel what they feel) and forget the rest. There is no depth. There is no understanding. There is no awareness of the interdependence of life itself.\nHow do you dive deeper?\nThrough conscious attention and awareness.\nCan you become aware of the EMF frequencies that your phone is emitting? I\u2019m not asking you to see or feel them. I am asking you to become aware of them. Visualize them. Know that they are there. Let your curiosity take you on a learning spree. Understand how it impacts everything it touches.\nCan you become aware of the coffee that is in your hands? What is the chemical composure of the coffee? Whose hands were involved in the manufacturing process of the coffee? What about the glass that it is held in?\nCan you see how you are focusing your attention on one specific figment of consciousness throughout this? You can separate the coffee from the glass, the molecules from the liquid, and as you expand and contract your focus \u2014 you become more or less aware of infinity.\nCan you contract down to a valve in your heart, expand out to everything within your field of vision, and manipulate your focus to everything in between?\nLike driving a car. Sometimes you are happy, windows down, singing your favorite song at the top of your lungs. Other times you are scared for your survival, hyper focused in a moments notice of the deer that just jumped in front of your car.\nYou navigate, appreciate, and thrive in life by mastering your focus.\nA Thought Exercise\nWe talk a lot about my concept of The Unknown.\nIt is a dark, scary place where infinite opportunity lies.\nA layer beneath your perceived reality.\nThink of your ego as a flashlight that your being is holding.\nThink of the beam of light being emitted as your perception.\nThink of your life as being a culmination of everything you have become directly conscious of by shining your flashlight on it.\nThink of yourself as an explorer on The Unknown.\n(All understanding is metaphorical, you have experienced this before. Language is how we communicate our experience. Your direct experience is a manifestation of infinity.)\nYou are in a dark room that spans in infinite directions.\nYour vision is the north star, the tiny light at the end of the tunnel.\nYour goals are dimly lit candles that outline your mission. The path to actualizing your vision.\nThe limited consciousness that comes along with holding the flashlight will not serve you well on this journey.\nThe ego, or flashlight, is in a common state of narrow focus. What the light reveals is what you see. If you turn your back on (or forget) your vision, you will be lost in the dark.\nThrow the flashlight away for a second. No, it\u2019s not that easy in reality. Just imagine with me.\nThere is a ball of light in your chest that you can contract and expand.\nStop. Imagine a ball of light in your chest. Can you sense it\u2019s warmth? With your conscious attention, can you move it slowly down your body and into your stomach? Can you move that ball of light down and out into the middle of your legs \u2014 feeling the edges of the ball radiate on the inside of your calves?\nNow, can you slowly expand that ball, wider and wider, it has engulfed your entire body now. Feel it \u201cbrightening\u201d your blood, veins, brain, and anything else that you can become conscious of in this moment.\nExpand your focus further and out into the room. How far can you go? Can you bring everything within a 50 foot radius of you into your open focus?\nAs you are navigating The Unknown, can you become more present, conscious, and aware of the path in front of you?\nWhen you \u201czoom out\u201d are there any worries in the world?\nCan you see the big picture?\nWhen you hit a roadbump in your path and your inner light goes out, are you going to pick up the flashlight and narrow in on the problem \u2014 making it your entire world?\nTwo steps to happiness:\n\nZoom in on what's important.\nZoom out from everything else.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 2, 2022\nThis is one of my favorite meditations I like to do on my daily walks. It\u2019s fun contract and expand your focus and visualize your path to a better life.\nMaybe I\u2019ll create a true process, even a guided meditation for this one day to solidify it even further.\nThis letter was fun to write.\nI hope you enjoyed it \u2014 although it\u2019s not hyper practical \u2014 which I would see as a good thing for breaking more people out of their surface-level existence.\nUntil next week,\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nNot much.\nThere are no podcasts or YouTube videos this week in preparation for the Digital Economics Masters curriculum.\nI will be building out and launching a product live with everyone that is enrolled.\nYou will get a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d look at how simple it is to build out a product that sells with the knowledge you already have in your head.\nIf you\u2019re interested in building a leverageable brand for the future, creating original content around your interests, and solving your own problems to earn an income \u2014 enroll in the next Master\u2019s curriculum here."

        "content": "I\u2019ve been riding motorcycles for most of my adult life.\nMy first \u201ccar\u201d at 16 years old was a motorcycle. (A CBR250R for my fellow enthusiasts).\nI eventually graduated to a Yamaha R6 after a year or so. (A much faster sport bike). Ended up going through 2 of those.\nLast year, before moving to Austin, I was riding my Yamaha R1. (Even faster, like\u2026 too fast\u2026 but it fit my tall body).\nMy Previous R1\nAfter being in Texas for a few months, I had the itch to get on a bike again.\nMy roommate (also my YouTube editor) wanted to learn how to ride.\nSo we went and picked up a used beginner bike for him to learn on.\nHe purchased a Honda Rebel 500.\nI ended up purchasing this beauty.\nCoffee Cup In-Hand (Of Course)\nNow, I could talk all day about how riding a bobber is SO much different from riding a supersport, but that\u2019s not what we are here to learn.\n(The motorcycles will make sense soon, I promise).\nThe Importance Of Learning\nI have some issues with the modern education system.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 it has some great aspects to it \u2014 everyone should be on a similar page in terms of how we operate as a society.\nBut in terms of living as nature intended?\nIt\u2019s a horrible solution for helping people find, learn about, and make a career out of something they care about.\nThe modern education system works against our psyche that is wired for survival.\nIt pushes us to \u201clearn,\u201d memorize, and get trained into a job that has nothing to do with what we spent learning and memorizing.\nThe other thing\u2026 mass education will never be able to keep up with the digital economy that continues to evolve at an exponential rate.\nOnly those that know how to pursue their curiosity, learn fast, and become \u201ctool-independent\u201d will end up on top.\nBy leaning into your nature \u2014 your survival-wired brain \u2014 you will begin to reap the benefits of doing so.\nLearning is how you become more aware, conscious, and skilled in the game of life.\nWhen you start playing a game for the first time, you learn:\nThe rules of the game\nThe mechanics and controls\nHow to win the game\nYou are curious about how fun the game will be.\nYou go through a tutorial video or read the rule book.\nYou test your limits as a level 1 player and quickly realize that you have a lot of work to do.\nYou start asking yourself questions:\nIs this game for me?\nIs it actually worth my time?\nWill I even have fun playing this?\nAre my friends playing the game?\nHow many people are playing the game in the world?\nHow much time, money, and other resources will this consume?\nAsking questions is how you determine if it is worth adopting this new activity into your life.\nYou have other things going on, no?\nYou have routines, lifestyles, social events, habits, errands, and other things that could be impacted by playing this game on a consistent basis.\nIf playing that specific game isn\u2019t perceived as more \u201cfun\u201d or more \u201cvaluable\u201d or an activity than the other games you are playing, why would you make a constant in your life?\nThis is where a lot of people fall off.\nThey stop playing the game while they are still level 1.\nLearning is how you uncover the depth that life has to offer.\nWhen you first start learning a game (or trying something new in life) you may not like it.\nIt may not make sense to you just yet.\nMaybe you \u201chate\u201d going antique shopping with your wife on Sundays.\nIt\u2019s not that you hate it. It\u2019s that you don\u2019t understand it.\nIt\u2019s not a game to you, it\u2019s a nuisance.\nAll you see are boring old antiques that serve no purpose in your life.\nTo your wife, however, antique shopping is a fun game that she is a high level in.\nShe has fun trying to find the \u201chidden gems\u201d in the antique shop\nShe understands history to a point where she can appreciate the antiques\nHer father was a woodworker and it brings back memories of him when she see\u2019s rocking chairs\nShe is curious to dive deep into the inner workings of the game.\nShe has clarity on how to play the game through experience.\nShe makes connections to other past or potential experiences that the game presents.\nShe fabricates a challenge in her mind to engage in the game on that day.\nShe raises her consciousness to see the web of interconnectedness the game presents.\nBut you\u2026 you haven\u2019t even started playing. You don\u2019t see it as a game. You fixate your focus on the tip of the iceberg and assume that everything under the water serves no purpose.\nYou aren\u2019t giving yourself a chance to find your \u201cwhy.\u201d\nDo this enough and you won\u2019t see past the tip of the iceberg of life itself. A shallow existence.\nYou will find yourself ready to quit before you even leave the tutorial.\nAt level 1, you can only assume or predict what exists in levels above you.\nAt level 100, you have a birds eye view of the levels under you.\nThe Art Of Doing Whatever You Want\nWhenever I talk about \u201cdoing what you want\u201d I always get the same responses.\n\u201cYou mean if I wanted to jump off a bridge I should???\u201d\n\u201cYou mean if I want to be the next Hitler I should?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean it\u2019s okay if people are mass murderers?!?!\u201d\nWake the fuck up. Stop it. Have some common sense and think critically about what you are saying.\nThis brings up the difference between conscious and unconscious living.\nIf you were conscious of the widespread impact of what \u201cbecoming the next Hitler\u201d would lead to, you wouldn\u2019t want to do it.\nIf you did it anyway, good. That\u2019s how you become aware of your blindspots and work to change them.\nIf you were conscious of your immoral actions and how it displaces the balance of the collective system, you would work to change them.\nYou would want to improve\u2026 if you were conscious.\nMid Koe Letter reminder: readers can join Modern Mastery for $5 here.

Not only occasionally, but on demand. That is, once you understand the parts of the system. The aspects of the game.\nI call it The Life Enjoyment 5.\nAll five \u201cC\u2019s\u201d of enjoyment are both tools and tells.\nYou can use and combine them to increase your enjoyment of day-to-day existence.\nOr you can become aware of them when you are doing things you genuinely enjoy.\nThis reminds me of Eckhart Tolle\u2019s 3 Modalities Of Doing\nAcceptance\nEnjoyment\nEnthusiasm\nWhich are great tools to be at peace with whatever situation you are in \u2013 but that\u2019s just it\u2026\nEvery situation brings vastly different variables to the table.\nI love Eckhart and his modalities served me well, but there is more.\nMy purpose with this is to build and create from his work (as well as others) to bring a more powerful concept to the table. One that allows you to become aware of the depth and opportunity that life has to offer.\nThe LE5 is not linear, they happen as they happen. Non-sequential.\nCuriosity\nWhat do you feel pulled to do?\nWhen you feel the pull, what limiting beliefs arrive?\nFrom there, pause and question.\nDon\u2019t let your monkey brain think that your survival is at stake.\nThe death of a belief is not death itself \u2014 even when it feels eerily similar.\nQuestioning is how you open up new mental pathways to explore.\nQuestioning is how you expand your consciousness by diving down the rabbit hole of infinity.\nQuestioning is how you dictate what you need to self-educate on next.\nThis is difficult at first, but is usually catalyzed by the question:\n\u201cWhat if?\u201d\nWhat if I learned that skill?\nWhat if I traveled no matter the cost?\nWhat if I committed to starting that business?\nWhen we went out to purchase the motorcycles, we got absorbed in all of the different models, the purpose they serve, and the minor differences.\nWe were both curious.\nWhat would our days look like if we had this new mode of transportation?\nThat triggered many other questions, which begin to tie in the other tools of the LE5.\nAs you can guess, that has opened up a new world to explore and experience (not just on the road).\nWe\u2019ve met new friends that have bikes and effectively expanded our network of high-level individuals in Austin.\nWe\u2019ve felt compelled to explore backroads and get out in nature.\nThe list goes on.\nClarity\nThe cause of most modern problems is clarity.\nAnxiety, uncertainty, fixed mindsets, closed-mindedness, and the rest are all due to a lack of clarity.\nWhat you want (goal)\n\nHow to get there (clarity)\n\nWhy you want to (intention)\n\nWhen these 3 things fall into place, your choice to act becomes seamless.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) December 6, 2021\nThis deserves an entire article, and is the backbone of The Creation Pyramid, creativity in general, and Intelligent Imitation.\nRelating to motorcycles, here was the process:\nImmerse\nImitate\nInnovate\nDevan, my editor that bought the motorcycle with me, used me for a few things:\nEducation \u2014 I ran him through the tutorial of playing the motorcycle game (the basics, mechanics, and/or fundamentals of riding).\nCoach \u2014 I revealed his blind spots AS he was riding. I helped him eliminate problems as they arose.\nResource \u2014 I gave him other \u201cmentors\u201d to study and material to read to speed up his learning.\nWhether you are learning a new skill or struggling with a specific task\u2026\nClarity comes down to structure, information, and surrender.\nInformation is abundant and potentially overwhelming, yet necessary.\nStructuring that information (or ordering consciousness) is how you start to \u201coutline the puzzle.\u201d\nSurrender and rest usually piece everything together.\nLike when a writer brainstorms 15 headlines, puts his pen down, and goes to lay out by the pool (this is actually a thing, most writers get most of their work done during rest).\nOr when a programmer can\u2019t figure out a bug, but the perfect solution comes to them when they are in the shower.\nThis can be applicable to motorcycles, but the \u201csurrender\u201d aspect comes into play with longer commitments. Starting your business, improving yourself, making the most of life, etc.\nConnection\nIn psychology there is a phenomena known as pattern recognition. There is also the \u201cconstruct aware\u201d stage of ego development along with systems thinking as a whole.\nConnection stems from the ability to zoom out, see the big picture, and recognize patterns, models, constructs, and connections.\nThis is best illustrated as the \u201caha!\u201d moment (or a series of these moments).\nAlong with curiosity, connection raises dopamine in the brain.\nIt causes excitement. It makes you want to share what you are learning. Most of the time you can\u2019t help but tell everyone about your new motorcycle and everything you\u2019ve learned about it.\nReferring to Steven Kotler\u2019s 5 intrinsic drivers, connection can also be seen under the lens of purpose and passion.\nWhen you connect what you are learning with something else that has real world utility, you start to cultivate passion for the purpose that your new skill holds. (like solving a big problem in the world, starting a business, or direct application to your life right now).\nChallenge\nChallenge is encoded in the system.\nChallenge is what kicks you into flow.\nChallenge is what eliminates boredom.\nWe are so afraid as a society to take on new challenges because they threaten the comfort we\u2019ve been conditioned into.\nIf your work, life, or self isn\u2019t challenging you on a consistent basis, I can assure you that your life won\u2019t be interesting. I can also assure you that you aren\u2019t making much progress.\nAgain, this brings up the importance of consistent self-reflection and setting new goals.\nSet a challenging goal\nGain clarity by breaking it down into smaller goals\nAct with intention by aligning all aspects of your life (mind, body, spirit, business) with those goals.\nIf you get anxious or start overthinking, you need clarity. You need to learn, practice, and teach to increase your skill that revolves around that goal.\nIf you get bored or aren\u2019t engaged with the task at hand, you need to set new goals that match your skill.\nConsciousness\nWe will discuss consciousness more in the coming weeks.\nConsciousness is about depth and appreciation. Love.\nFor now, start seeing beyond the surface.\nTake on the challenge of becoming curious in understanding all of the connections that any given situation presents (so you can gain clarity).\nWhile most people perceive a motorcycle as a purposeless death machine \u2014 you can make the conscious choice to see beyond that and break out of your unconscious, conditioned emotional reactions to life.\nDive deeper.\nAppreciate the entire process it took to create that motorcycle.\nAppreciate the opportunities it opens to those who ride it.\nAppreciate the game that people have chosen to play.\nSeek to understand by dissecting what you see into smaller parts. Then dissect further.\nSeriously, stop what you are doing, think of a motorcycle, and start to dissect downward and construct upward.\nWith your mind, dissect the motorcycle into it\u2019s parts, where those parts came from, who was involved, and keep going deeper until you reach the base elements that we use to build physical material.\nWith your mind, construct a potential reality that would be conducive to your vision if a motorcycle was involved. Can you meet new people? Can you adopt a new hobby into your life?\nThis is impossible to do if you are a slave to the unconscious thought patterns that keep your mind closed and narrow.\nContinue this dissection and construction process as you go about your day to day life.\nYou can do this with anything. (Even the screen you are looking at). A n y t h i n g.\nHow do you think I create content?\nHow do you think I create an income via unconventional methods?\nHow do you think anyone creates in general?\nPause, dive deep, and appreciate.\nRaise your consciousness.\nDissect and construct.\nThink.\nYou can use the LE5 to identify, understand, and solve problems across multiple domains using everything we just talked about.\nThis is difficult to understand until experienced.\nMy advice:\nSave the LE5 graphic to your phone.\nStudy it\u2019s parts and let your curiosity run wild. (Dissect and construct \u2014 create)\nWhen you are learning, start to notice the different aspects of this concept.\nNotice how you feel and question why you feel that way.\nThis will allow you to understand yourself on a deeper level and start to replicate those results.\nWhen you find yourself in a bad mood, use the LE5 to your advantage:\nQuestion why you are in a bad mood (curiosity)\nSet a goal to reverse the bad mood (challenge)\nReverse engineer it so you know what to learn (clarity)\nAs you learn, observe the excitement that fills your mind as you make new discoveries (excitement)\nRemain conscious during this entire process.\nThis is a huge topic that we will continue to apply, dissect, construct, and understand.\nUntil next time my friends,\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nI uploaded a podcast that gives an overview of consciousness and the role it plays in creativity.\nListen here.\nA new YouTube video titled \u201cWhy You Won\u2019t Change (How To Reinvent Yourself)\u201d just went live.\nWatch here.\nInside Modern Mastery, I uploaded my simple and intuitive process to building out profitable digital products.\nJoin here for $5."

        "content": "Society is a mass hallucination.\nAsk yourself this:\nHow did you determine what is true or false when you were growing up?\nMeaning, how did you interpret the positive or negative feedback that programs the complex systems that compose your mind? This leads to your unconscious decision-making, thought patterns, how you perceive reality, and everything else that makes up your direct experience right now.\nSystems learn from the \u2018bad\u2019 and double down on the \u2018good\u2019 to hardwire neural networks relating to the survival of the human race.\nThe question again, how did you determine what was true or false from the time you were born?\nYou learned from your parents, school system, mass media, possibly university, and other societal constructs like religious organizations, right?\nNow ask again, how did your parents determine what is true or false when they grew up?\nHow did your school teachers determine what was true or false? University professors? Google search results that are heavily manipulated and favor university-level information? Maybe Wikipedia? Created by universities and those that went to university, used by university students to create the research papers that will go up elsewhere on Google?\nIf you question your beliefs enough, you end up with nothing but the pieces of a game. You end up with an understanding that everything that we can make sense of with words is a human construct that does not have a base of absolute truth.\nThese constructs are what anchor your mind to reality. These constructs create the game that we\u2019ve unconsciously built ourselves into.\nWhen you are aware of this game, you can learn to win it.\nWhen you are unaware of this game, you are just another construct. An anchor to help the players navigate and win the game. An NPC.\nSee: keyboard warriors, political zealots, bible thumpers, flavor of the day drama, and others that are brought to the attention to the minds of many (usually by the media) either causing an emotional reaction in them (consumers, unaware, unconscious, mindless, etc) or being used as feedback on what to avoid (creators, aware, conscious, mindful, etc).\nContemplate this. You may not be as unique as you think you are. I am not excluding myself from this. Nobody is excluded.\nBreaking Free Of The Conditioned Path\nIt is rare to see somebody that is living a passionate, zestful life.\nIt is even more rare to see somebody that willingly \u201cworks\u201d all day.\nBuilding, writing, contemplating, curious, experiencing, diving deep into the unknown, and meditating on the problems that keep them up at night.\nSomething has to change.\nIf your future is the result of societal education and conditioning, it is safe to say you will have the same future as everyone else. And to be frank, that doesn\u2019t seem very enticing.\nIf you are lost, the answer is education.\n\nIf you are educated, the answer is action.\n\nIf you are acting, the answer is consistency.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) March 29, 2022\nYou will feel lost when you start pursuing your own path.\nNothing worthwhile is predictable. There is not a set path. You cannot expect one, because if there were one, it would be taught in schools. The people that get paid the most are not those that are trained into an occupation constructed by society. Anybody can do that. That is how you become a \u201ccog in the machine.\u201d\nYou\u2019re reading this letter because you have a (good) desire for more in life. You want to bridge the gap between work and life. You want to live a life of zest, passion, and deep satisfaction for the domain you decide to pursue with full force.\nI may not be able to give you an exact path to more money, passion, and satisfaction \u2014 but I can give you a rough guide.\nThe first step you need to take when going down a new path in life is education.\nSelf-education to be exact. You have to revive your child-like curiosity, feel into it, and let it guide you throughout life. Some people use the words intuition, your \u201ccalling,\u201d your purpose, or anything else that refers to tapping into the intelligent voice inside you (that everyone is born with).\nA good place to start is to think about your childhood. Did you have a natural affinity towards anything? Did you gravitate towards specific interests? Some people may have a slight inclination towards sound, making them want to get into music.\nI recently realized that I had been suppressing my curiosity for a long time. As a teenager I was obsessed with weird people like Frank Yang, a spiritual bodybuilder, that would spout off about consciousness and other esoteric topics. I\u2019d like to entertain the thought that I understood what he was talking about, I didn\u2019t.\nIf I had dove deep into that interest, it would have opened new paths for my curiosity to explore:\nHow can I make an income out of this? If I became obsessed with figuring that out for a year \u2014 it would happen.\nHow does consciousness work help with bodybuilding? Or vice versa? How about yoga? Is there a benefit to it beyond physical health?\nWhat nutritional protocol, if any, would help raise my level of consciousness?\nAnother reflection \u2013 I\u2019ve always been hell-bent on avoiding the corporate life and doing \u201cwhat I love\u201d for a living. I knew it wasn\u2019t impossible, so why not dedicate my life to figuring it out?\nDiving DEEP \u2014 and I mean DEEP (over time) \u2014 into a particular interest is how you pursue a truly unique path.\nIf you chose email marketing, your curiosity could pull you in 1000 different directions. You would have to learn copywriting, email marketing software, sequences, social media to grow the newsletter, etc. All of these open up new paths again for your curiosity exploration.\nYour curiosity would eventually lead you to something that seems completely unrelated to your the interest you initially chose. This differentiates you from the sea of individuals pursuing a set path \u2014 giving you informational leverage that you can charge big bucks for.\nWe live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) June 21, 2017\nCan you see how simply adopting the habit of self-education (and execution, of course) will lead to the life you want? It is the simple commitment to never rely on anything but yourself to actualize your potential.\nMoney is no longer optional. The need for money is encoded in the system. We don\u2019t live in huts or hunt our own food anymore. Our psyche remains the same \u2014 wired for survival \u2014 but the environment we live in is completely different.\nThe first thing you should begin educating yourself on is a skill that will eventually help you make money. This can be anything really, but marketable skills are usually the best option (and beginner-level information is readily available online). We will talk more about this later.\nThe Domain Of Mastery has you choose 3 interests. These can change at anytime. These are just a starting point for pursuing your curiosity. By studying these and improving your skillset, you are diving deeper into the unknown. You are exposing yourself to information that schools won\u2019t teach you.\nThe thing that most people don\u2019t understand is that in order to be a Master Of One, you have to be a jack of all trades. You have to dive deep into the iceberg of awareness if you want to be creative in that domain. A health coach without deep knowledge in psychology will not be able to get client results. They will think its a calorie intake problem when the root problem is societal conditioning and habit formation.\nBeing a specialist can be trained. We are not trying to do something that others can be trained into.\nAs you dive deeper into these interests, you will realize that they all lead to the same thing \u2014 which is life itself. The universe is a giant mind. A network of complex and creative systems.\nHere are 4 tips to begin your curiosity exploration:\n1) Study The Principles\nWhen you learn Photoshop, aside from knowing how to navigate the software, there are only a few things you need to know \u2014 the principles.\nSelections, masks, and adjustment layers.\nWhen you understand those, you can pretty much create anything you would need (unless the project demands something more.\nThis is true with almost anything. When you understand the principles, you can accomplish 80% of the work you would need to get done in that domain.\n2) Find \u201cMentors\u201d\nWhen I say find mentors, I mean find a congruent voice that you can learn from. Some of you are attracted to the philosophical or spiritual aspect of this newsletter even though I talk about business.\nYou may or may not get useful information from someone who talks strictly about business.\nSearch for books, social media accounts, podcasters, YouTubers, and any other information you can find on your topic of interest. If what they teach does not register with you, find another mentor that has a congruent voice you can make sense of (and are excited to learn from).\n3) Start A Real-World Project\nI always recommend starting a personal brand to post your learnings online. That alone will force you to understand money-making skills if you want to see real progress. Copywriting, marketing, persuasion, sales, etc are all necessary to put out an impactful message and turn your interests into income.\nRemember, you can only learn so much by learning. You have to apply what you learn if you want to open new mental pathways to explore.\nIf you keep things in your head, you will get stuck in a loop of learning the same thing over and over without moving to the next level. You need real world feedback.\n4) Be Observant Of Connections\nThis leads into our next point, but once the principles are solidified in your head and you are actively struggling / failing with your real world project \u2014 you will start to recognize patterns in everyday life.\nCreating content brings an entirely new sense of enjoyment to life. Pattern recognition increases dopamine levels in the brain (because you are hunting for your survival). You start to recognize things you never have before \u2014 because they actually have a use case now.\nYou start to appreciate the depth that life has to offer when you have something to apply your everyday experiences to \u2014 writing content online.\nThis all falls within the Intelligent Imitation process \u2014 in short, immerse yourself in an environment conducive to your goals and relentlessly eliminate distractions that do not serve your development.\nSide note: my free 7 Days To Genius challenge will help you study, dissect, and take notes on your interests in a way that is unique to you. This is how you come up with unlimited content ideas, 10X your creative output, and raise your consciousness by diving deeper into your Domain Of Mastery.\nThe private community, Modern Mastery, will help you write engaging content, grow an audience, and monetize your knowledge (like you see other\u2019s doing, but think they are any more experienced than you) \u2014 Koe Letter readers can join for $5 here.\nThe Experience Model\nKen Wilber \u2014 possibly the most conscious man alive \u2014 talks about developmental states and stages.\nStates are temporary.\nStages are permanent (ish?).\nYou can have a high month in business \u2014 which is a state \u2014 but it may not be maintained month to month.\nBut, if you develop your business leverage to a point where it\u2019s near impossible to dip under $20K a month, that is a stage.\nYou can enter a flow state, or you can develop yourself to a point of being in a perpetual degree of flow (see: enlightenment).\nYou can have a burst of creativity, or you can develop yourself to a point of having a baseline level of creativity.\nThis is true for most traits, skills, and domains of life.\nLet\u2019s think of it like a video game.\nYou can get powerups and buffs \u2014 states that allow you to perform better temporarily.\nOr you can increase your XP, add points to your talent tree, and unlock new stages of the game that you didn\u2019t know existed at a lower level.\nThis stresses the importance of self-development. It is not optional. If you want to make it in a world where low-skill labor jobs are consistently being phased out \u2014 self-development, continuous skill acquisition, and mental expansion are not optional.\nThis is why I recommend \u201cdevelopment\u201d being one of the interests in your Domain Of Mastery.\nSpecifically cognitive or mental development.\nMost of your problems stem from mental limitations and blockages.\n\nIf you want to master all areas of life, mental mastery must be at the top of your list.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) December 4, 2021\nOne more thing before we move on:\nWhen you max out a specific trait, do you just stop?\nOf course not, you move on to the next trait and aim to max that one out as well.\nNot to mention, in order to max out any specific trait, you need to make some form of progress in related traits.\nThis is why some unhealthy businessmen suffer. They are financially wealthy \u2014 but they lack the physical, mental, and spiritual wealth.\nThis is also why some dictators are corrupt. They\u2019ve surpassed multiple stages of development in communication and leadership \u2014 but their moral development lags behind significantly.\nNow, how does this all relate to business?\nAs you dive deeper into your Domain Of Mastery, it will demand a certain amount of cognitive development to reach the next \u201cstage.\u201d\nWhen you reach this first stage, you are ready to start monetizing.\nYour job is to help people reach that stage of development faster than you did with what you learned along the way.\nYou do this by selling a creative solution that will help someone navigate your path in less time.\nThe funny thing \u2014 by helping others reach that developmental stage that you have (whether it\u2019s free or paid) you are forced to organize the information and make connections.\nThis is why writing online is so powerful. You HAVE to struggle with organizing information (or ordering consciousness) to pass along to others.\nThe teacher learns more than the student.\nThis will open up room to reach your next developmental stage faster.\nWhen you have everything you\u2019ve made sense of packaged up and hosted in the digital world \u2014 you don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. You get to build on top of it. Iteration.\nBy doing this consistently over a 2-3 year span, you will bust through new stages of development, help others get there, and gain a deep satisfaction for life in general.\nDiscovering Your Life\u2019s Work\nIf you are reading this, I am assuming that you don\u2019t know what your life\u2019s work is.\nNOBODY can tell you what it is. NOBODY can tell you exactly how to find it. NOBODY can help you discover YOUR life\u2019s work. This isn\u2019t mine. This isn\u2019t your professor\u2019s. This isn\u2019t your parents. This isn\u2019t any other entity that is projecting its wants and needs onto you. It is up to you to embrace the inevitable uncertainty that comes with \u2018forging your own path\u2019 and picking up pieces of the \u2018life\u2019s work puzzle\u2019 over years of exploration.\nI cannot give you a clear path to discovering it. That is the beauty in it. Only you can find it through consistent self-development, putting your message out into the world, and iterating on your creations until the perfect idea pops into your brain (just for you to continue iterating and refining what you think your life\u2019s work is.\nHowever, there are a few questions you can begin contemplating to prime your brain.\nAccording to Joe Dispenza:\nContemplation builds the circuits in your brain in preparation for the experience.\nMeaning, if you are intentional and actively expanding your awareness in search for your life\u2019s work, you will find it. I \u201cfound\u201d mine last year after outlining a book I\u2019ve been wanting to write. I can\u2019t explain the feeling.\nUntil then, here are two questions to meditate on:\nWhat is the BIG problem you want to solve in the world? The one that keeps you up at night.\nWhat is the BIG problem you want to solve in your life? The one you know is holding you back.\nIf you want to take it a bit further \u2014 if you could have any question about the world answered and hand-delivered to you, what would that question be? Start there.\nThis is how you develop yourself as a human.\nYou start asking questions to uncover problems.\nYou solve those problems through self-education and self-development.\nYou uncover problems that you can solve for others by pursuing your genuine curiosity (your Domain Of Mastery).\nOnce you solve enough problems, you will reach new stages of development.\nNow you can help people 1 stage under you navigate those same problems in a creative fashion.\nIf you are able to stay on this path (once you start, it\u2019s near impossible to stop) you will understand every aspect of this letter.\nHere are some problems I see people encounter that prevents their growth:\nThey don\u2019t take themselves or their message seriously. They are too afraid of external judgement, it dilutes their message, and they get stuck in a developmental stage.\nThey are too focused on the money. Which is fine at first, but given time leads to a lack of meaning and fulfillment in the work you\u2019ve built yourself into. It becomes another 9-5 instead of your life\u2019s work (work + life combined for a deeper satisfaction in the balance)\nThey do not see the value in consistent self-development (or they refuse to develop critical aspects that hold other aspects behind). Hence limiting their personal, creative, and professional potential.\nIn summary:\nChoose 3 interests that you are genuinely curious about.\nBegin studying them via books and online content from a congruent voice that you are excited to learn with.\nBuild a real-world project and do not suppress the problems that come up. YOU will need to change at some point. You will lose some people and things from your life as your development demands.\nIf you stay on the unconventional path for more than 6 months \u2014 you will understand on a deep, internal level that it is impossible to fail.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA YouTube video just went live on how to make an income as a creative with the infinite leverage that the internet presents.\nWatch the new video here.\n2 podcasts went live (they are only 10 minutes each).

        "content": "I was a boy scout when I was a kid.\nI would show up to my former church on Tuesday nights, put a 3 finger salute in the air, and recite the scout oath.\nOur troop would discuss our weekly agenda, work towards merit badges that interested us, and plan our next camping trip.\nEvery year we had what was called a \u201cHigh Adventure\u201d trip.\nThese adventures were week-long camping trips. Sometimes we would go and build our own snow caves to sleep in. Others we would join other scout troops from across the state, work towards different merit badges (like the survival merit badge where I had to create a shelter out of tree bark and \u201csurvive\u201d the night), and during the night we would sit around the campfire and play games.\nOne year we decided to go to Catalina Island. We had the lofty goal of kayaking around the island and camping on different beaches along the way.\nWhen that day came, we drove to California, got on the fairy, and landed in Catalina after an hour of card games and virgin Pi\u00f1a Coladas.\nSince we got there late we had to rush to our kayak rentals and \u201cset sail\u201d almost immediately. No downtime, a tad stressful.\nWe partnered up, strapped our oversized duffle bags to the back of the small boats, and banked on our previous canoeing (a canoe is a boat similar to a kayak) merit badge to have made us skilled enough to navigate the next 5 hours in the ocean.\nLife Comes In Waves\nThe waters were smooth for about an hour. No problems. Peaceful.\nThat was until the ocean\u2019s waves started getting a bit deeper. We thought it was temporary because we couldn\u2019t see the storm that was coming over the other side of the island. We were too close to the cliffside to see anything aside from the clear skies to our right.\nLong story short, we got caught in the middle of the storm halfway through our adventure.\nThe waves grew to a minimum of 10 feet in size.\nOur group started to get split up \u2014 the strong and able in the front, the weak in the back.\nMy buddy and I flipped our kayak multiple times. Soaked. Cold. Nearly losing our paddles. Can\u2019t hear a thing. Dense and heavy rain needling the parts of our body that were above water.\nMy duffel bag fell off at one point \u2014 soaking all of my food and clothes \u2013 making me dive in to grab it and attempt at tying it back on.\nNot to mention\u2026 we were paddling against the strong winds. Making barely any progress towards our beach destination.\nThis was the one moment in my life where I truly thought my life was over.\nThe scout leaders\u2019 orange paddles could only be seen when they were at the bottom of a wave when we were at the top. We lost them after about the first 30 minutes of the storm.\nMy kayak buddy and I went through phases of paddling as hard as we can and accepting our demise. Slouched in the storm. Defeated. Giving in to the waves and praying that they didn\u2019t slam us into the cliffside that was ~100-200 feet away from us.\nTime was a blur at this point. We eventually saw the shore, regained hope, and paddled as hard as we possibly fucking could to reach land.\nCrashing on shore, we dragged our kayak onto the beach and collapsed. All of us slightly convulsing from the cold trying to expose as much of our bodies to the sun as we could.\nThose that fell behind showed up with the island rescue team about an hour later. All of my food and clothes were still soaked (and ended up getting eaten by birds while we were sleeping).\nSafe to say, we had to call the trip short and left the next day.\nThere is a lot we can learn from this story, it mimics life\u2019s cycles of intensity quite well \u2014 but I want to paint a different picture.\nHigh Highs And Low Lows\nWhen we were on top of the waves, there was hope.\nWhen we were deep in the trenches, hope was scarce.\nWhen you feel on top of the world, nothing can stop you.\nWhen you fall to the bottom of the ocean, anything can stop you.\nYou\u2019re out in the cold, you start shivering, why? Because you\u2019re resisting the cold, you are tightening your muscles against the cold and you get the staggers. Take it easy, go with the cold, relax.\n\n\u2014 Alan Watts\nIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that tries to maintain equilibrium (homeostasis).\nThe 80/20 of what you need to know is that when equilibrium is displaced, it bounces back in the same amount the opposite direction and eventually brings itself back to equilibrium.\nOur mind is no different.\nThe high highs that we grow to look forward to in life are always followed by a low low. Always. If you don\u2019t recognize it as a low low \u2013 congratulations, you have developed a certain level of mindfulness when interacting the battles that come while you are deep in the trenches.\nOur mind is a network of complex systems that have been conditioned over time through positive and negative feedback. That\u2019s how systems work, right?\nIf you receive negative feedback, you won\u2019t do that again.\nIf you receive positive feedback, you will do that again.\nIf you consistently receive positive feedback for doing one specific thing, it becomes engrained in your psyche. The action, belief, or thought pattern become habitual. They happen on autopilot.\nLike training a dog. They don\u2019t understand words, but they can associate tones and patterns with certain meanings \u2014 positive and negative. If a dog has sub-optimal behavior, you use a certain tone or strategy to give the dog negative feedback. Do this enough times and they will eventually change their behavior, which you can reinforce (condition) with positive feedback.\nThis malleable nature of our mind can be very dangerous (when unconscious) or very beneficial (when conscious).\nThis shows that we have the power to recondition, reprogram, or rewire our brain \u2014 but our harmonic oscillator of a mind won\u2019t let us off that easy.\nShameless Mid Koe Letter Plug: Readers can join Modern Mastery for $5 \u2014 join 1000+ members and access 170+ life and business strategies, roadmaps, live trainings, & personalized help.\nLayers Of Identity\nIf you want to change your life, you must change your identity.\nA healthy person does not see eating healthy as a chore. They ARE a person that eats healthy. There is no other option. It is enjoyable to them.\nA businessman does not see focused work as a burden every morning. They ARE a person who gets work done every morning.\nChanging your beliefs, identity, and life is not as simple as it sounds.\nI want you to think of your mind as a city. Seattle Washington in specific.\nIn 1889, a glue pot tipped over resulting in a fire that destroyed a large portion of the city. Why?\nAside from the person that thought it would be wise to throw water on the flaming glue (making it spread fast) the city was built on a terrible foundation. Wooden buildings. Wooden sewage system. Poor construction \u2014 the lot of it.\nThe human psyche is wired for survival. When your beliefs, identity, or life is threatened \u2014 the brain signals the body, your focus starts to narrow, and you give a bit too much attention to the thoughts flooding your mind. Equilibrium is displaced and your mind starts reacting accordingly to bring you back to homeostasis.\nThe problem is that we live in a completely different world than our ancestors. We are rarely threatened on a physical level. Most of us have shelter, access to food, and the ability to make a living.\nHumans are the only beings that equate the death of a belief to physical death.\nThis survival mechanism can be dangerous and damaging. If you attempt to change your identity by making one small change, you displace equilibrium (or tip over a pot of glue) and potentially set fire to a portion of the city that has been built in your mind over years of construction (conditioning).\nWhen you try reconstruct a piece of your city, it may threaten the entire foundation. When you are at the bottom of the wave, you can\u2019t see anything. You may lose hope for reaching the shore. You may tip over your kayak a few times.\nWhen you are deep in the trenches of life, you may not interpret it as a good thing. You may take it as negative feedback \u2014 conditioning a faulty systematic thought pattern \u2014 and avoid anything that threatens the identity that isn\u2019t conducive to a high quality of life.\nThat\u2019s the challenge with all of this. New Rome is built on top of Ancient Rome (and no, it wasn\u2019t built in a day!). New Seattle is built on top of Old Seattle.\nAll of the buildings, foundations, streets, and other networks are all interconnected. Layers upon layers that rely on each other for proper function. An array of systems that work in unison to perform what it was meant to perform. Removing a specific part may cause temporary damage to how the systems function.\nSimilar to your identity \u2014 we make sense of ourselves through the layers of stories, beliefs, and engrained thought patterns that construct how optimally our mind operates.\nWould I cease to exist if I reconstructed my story? If I revealed and recreated the traumas of my past? What if I questioned my hardset religious beliefs? Would I still be \u201cme\u201d if my entire life didn\u2019t revolve around the church? What would my life look like if I didn\u2019t do the same thing day after day?\nIt would be difficult to make sense of \u2014 that\u2019s for sure.\nHow To Reinvent Yourself\nThere are 2 routes to reinventing yourself:\n1) Hit rock bottom.\nBy feeling into the lowest of lows in your life, you start to become fed up with your life situation.\nYou become hyper aware of what is holding you back. You dig deep into the layers of your identity and find just the right piece to remove in order to launch in the opposite direction.\nThis comes with a lot of pain and suffering \u2014 and is often uncontrollable. Burning down your metaphorical city may cause some deeper issues leading to another rock bottom years later in life.\nEverybody I have met that hit rock bottom was from an unfortunate hand they were dealt with by life itself.\nThere is a better option. One that is completely within your control.\n2) Stack small wins.\nEverybody has heard of James Clear\u2019s \u201cOne Percent Better Everyday\u201d mantra.\nIt holds a lot of power.\nWhen you reconstruct your city piece by piece, you build what would be New Seattle (without having to burn down half the city).\nWhere do you begin?\nBy getting crystal clear on your vision and anti-vision.\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want, understand what you don\u2019t want and work in the opposite direction.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 15, 2022\nThanks to our brains negativity bias, it is easy to observe what you don\u2019t want and start working in the opposite direction.\nWhen you outline a vision for your future, it will shine the light of awareness on your blindspots.\nIf you are lost, the answer is education.\n\nIf you are educated, the answer is action.\n\nIf you are acting, the answer is consistency.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) March 29, 2022\nAs you reverse engineer your vision into 10-year, 1-year, and monthly goals \u2014 you start to gain clarity on what you need to do in order to actualize that vision.\nNow, we can break things down into priority tasks.\nFrom there \u2014 and by far the most important step \u2014 is reducing the friction of taking action.\nWhat is the smallest mental, physical, emotional, or financial step you can take?\nIs it putting on your gym shoes and walking out the door?\nIs it moving one leg and getting off of the couch?\nIs it investing $25 into a course to show you are serious about improving your skill set?\nIs it reading the first word of a book or writing the first word of your own book?\nActively Construct Your Life\nThis is not an easy process. You are still in a metaphorical kayak in the middle of a storm. Life is chaotic. Ordering consciousness through vision and goal setting is how we gain a sense of certainty and control over our life.\nSince we are in an age similar to 5th century BC \u2014 there is information and an abundance of ideas circulating our world. People are losing trust in externally assigned hierarchies of goals whether it be from corporate culture, organized religions, or formal education.\nBecause of this, you must play an active role in constructing your life. This requires personal responsibility, massive self-belief, and the realization that nobody is coming to save you.\nIt is in your hands to collect and organize the abundant information in the world and organize it in a way that will result in a fulfilling income source, radiating health, an ordered mind, and a connected spirit.\nHard pill to swallow:\n\nMost of your limitations are self imposed. If you want something, there\u2019s always a way \u2013 your mind just won\u2019t let you see it.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) April 12, 2021\nIf you believe you are in the middle of a storm, you will be.\nIf you believe you are having fun on a roller coaster of waves, you will have fun.\nHow do you actively construct your life?\nThrough consciousness, creativity, and intention.\nThe easiest way to do this is by treating every facet of your life as a project.\nHere is all you need to start changing your life:\nPurchase a blank notebook\nIn big letters write \u201cMy Scientific Journal\u201d\nTreat your mind, body, spirit, and business as a lifelong project\nNote observations, test small changes, analyze the results, and double down on what works\nStay conscious and aware through silent observation (that can apply to your mental, physical, financial, and spiritual projects).\nSelf-educate to expand awareness and uncover new paths.\nHypothesize and experiment with solutions that will solve your problems.\nAnalyze the result and get feedback that will begin to rewire the network of systems in your mind.\nDocument a replicable process that can help other people and bring you more feedback.\nRinse and repeat.\nIt took 18+ years to condition you to the point you are now.\nDon\u2019t expect much progress overnight.\nThat, my friends, is how you reinvent yourself.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA new YouTube video went out about my story. How I failed at most online business models and turned it into a half-mil a year one-person business.\nYou can watch it here.\nWe are prepping for the live training next week with Dakota Robertson inside Modern Mastery. We will be going over how to get into Twitter Ghostwriting, landing your first client, and the skills you need to learn.\nKoe Letter readers can join for $5 here.\nFor those that are wondering why there haven\u2019t been podcast episodes recently \u2014 I\u2019ve had to prioritize my attention due to the launch of Digital Economics. The podcast has always been the first thing to go when I need to refocus. I will either get back on the same schedule soon or start doing bite size big ideas of the week (5-10 minute episodes).\nIf you have suggestions on a podcast style you\u2019d like to see, let me know by replying to this email!"

        "content": "Humans are lazy.\nWe have been creating solutions to make our lives easier for the entirety of human evolution.\nAt times, this comes at a cost. It is a common theme for us to phase out labor jobs.\nWe didn\u2019t like plowing fields. It was unsustainable and almost impossible to scale with a growing population.\nSo, over a few decades, we created machines, tractors, distribution, GMO crops, and many other things that opened up more room for creativity.\nI found this tweet the other day as I was scrolling the timeline.\nThe McDonalds in Marana AZ got rid of human cashiers \u2014 your only option is the self-serve kiosk. Giant step backwards for our society. Takes like 20minutes to order $57 of food (a quarter pounder, burger not meal, is $6.50 in Joe Biden\u2019s economy!). Bring back the humans pic.twitter.com/eSigaCA3NZ\n\u2014 Blake Masters (@bgmasters) June 6, 2022\nPolitics aside, this is nothing new. It has been coming for a long time.\nLow-skill labor jobs are being phased out. History has shown this pattern time and time again. There is no escaping this phase of evolution.\nIf the work doesn\u2019t require creativity, delegate it, automate it, or leave it.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) September 30, 2020\nPeople are already doing this.\nIf the work doesn\u2019t require creativity, you can bet your future that it will be delegated, automated, or phased out.\nThere is only one option: take responsibility for your future and relentlessly self-educate.\nCreate Or Be Created\nConsciousness is the fabric of reality. The ability to order consciousness is the greatest skill of the 21st century. That is, the ability to:\nCreate certainty from uncertainty\nCreate sense from non-sense\nCreate clarity from chaos\nCreate focus from distraction\nCreate signal from noise\nCreate something from nothing\nCreate success from failure\nCreate meaning from struggle\nCreate life from death\nCreate positive from negative\nThat bullet point list is the path to your version of success.\nNature is creative. You are creative. God is creative. The universe is creative.\nOur subconscious stores information that is processed based on what we are exposed to via our senses. Like collecting the dots before you can connect them with your conscious mind.\nCreation is the process of molding, controlling, and ordering consciousness (that can be tapped into via the subconscious). At that point, we can bring that gift into the world via the senses.\nSight, sound, taste, touch, smell, and of course the 6th sense that very few people tap into:\nAwareness.\nOur subconscious stores everything that we have been made aware of at some point in our lives.\nThis is the foundation of creativity \u2014 the ability to pull from, connect, and solve problems from the depths of infinity.\nCreativity is to create clarity from chaos.\nCreate + clarity = creativity.\nCreative solutions to modern problems are how you pull in the big bucks.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that creative abilities are harnessed by so few. By the time we are 18 and have been popped out of the school system, we are aware of very little. Everyone does what they are told \u2014 because that is all they are aware of \u2014 instead of exploring the unknown and making new discoveries. Expanding their mind, awareness, and consciousness.\nRather than creating our own reality via the internal, our reality has been created via the external.\nLiving in the now or \u201cbeing present\u201d isn\u2019t exclusive to spiritual people. It is a necessity for living a life of joy, creativity, and wonder. The present moment is how we tap into infinity (or God source, the universe, or any other interpretation of the intelligence that we can\u2019t grasp with the traditional 5 senses.)\nAs a creative, your job is to expand your awareness and raise your consciousness by diving into the unknown.\nThink of your exploration of the unknown as a mission to collect dots. When it comes time to create, you tune into infinity with the intention to connect the dots.\nYou cannot tap into your creative ability when your focus is unconscious and narrow.\nYou can tap into your full creative ability when your focus is conscious and open.\nWe can philosophize about this all day, but I want to give you practical steps to harnessing your creative abilities to thrive over the next decade.\nCreativity Is Not Inherently Valuable\nYou can spend 6 figures to earn a PhD in artistic basket weaving \u2014 but if you don\u2019t understand what humans perceive as valuable, you will never be able to live off of that profession.\nThere are skills that need to be learned (how you expand your awareness / consciousness) in order to increase the perceived value of your creativity.\nAnd that\u2019s just the thing, value is dictated by perception. What you deem valuable may be a hunk of garbage to the next person.\nIt is absolutely crucial that you study all facets of human understanding:\nStorytelling\nPsychology\nSpirituality\nPhilosophy\nMarketing\nSales\nBranding\nPersuasion\nDesign or visual storytelling\nColor theory\nCapturing attention\nYourself (self-awareness)\nBy studying one of these, you expose yourself to all of them and open up unique paths into the unknown. They are all the same thing, just viewed under different lenses of perception and perceived via a unique combination of senses.\nHuman understanding is an iceberg that everyone must master. Why? Because you need to understand how to communicate the value of your creativity. You need to play the money Game if you want to make money. Don\u2019t let your ego get in the way of developing communication skills. They are necessary if you want to build a creative income.\nThe deeper you dive into this iceberg of mastery, the more life will flow in your favor. Start with the ones that are most practical to distributing your value \u2014 marketing, branding, persuasion, and sales.\nThose are the fuel for monetizing any skillset. If you want to be able to sell a creative solution, you need to be able to attract people to that solution. In other words, you need traffic and distribution. You do this by building an audience, building leverage, and building other distribution networks like an email list. There are other methods like paid ads and media buying \u2014 but those make sense once you have a creative solution that is selling.\nHow do you learn these skills?\nLike you would any other \u2014 but most people suck at learning:\n1) Immerse yourself in an echo chamber of information related to the skill you are trying to learn.\nFor 1 month, only consume information related to what you are trying to learn.\nBuy 1 book that gives a broad overview of all aspects of that topic. Buy a course from someone that is an expert in that topic and has condensed the information to what you need to know. Follow blogs, podcasts, social media accounts, and everything else you can.\nWherever you go, you want to be exposed to all aspects of this topic of interest. You want to gain awareness \u2014 collect the dots \u2014 in the iceberg of mastery you are diving into.\n2) Start a personal project with potential profitability.\nWhen I was learning to code there was one piece of advice that every educator harped on:\nGet out of tutorial hell.\nNobody listens to this advice of course. They are afraid of diving into the true unknown.\nWhy would someone start personal project when they have no idea what to do after they start (and sometimes have no idea how TO start)?\nThat\u2019s exactly why you should start one.\nBecause it makes your unconscious problems conscious \u2014 fast.\n3) Embrace the chaos and understand that nothing worth having is predictable.\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018\nOrdering consciousness by exploring the unknown is how you find specific knowledge. Specific knowledge is \u2014 in the context of this letter \u2014 is a creative solution that you find by collecting and connecting dots through self-education and building personal projects.\nBy constructing your own hierarchy of goals related to the vision you are trying to actualize, you experience the phases of life that teach the lessons that 99% of the population won\u2019t have access to.\nConsistency and persistence are key here.\nIt is okay if you start over from scratch.\nIt is not okay if you abandon the unconventional path as a whole.\nWhen in doubt, take some time off and reflect on your exploration for a meaningful life through the unknown.\nThe 3 Point Business Model\nThe first personal project with high potential profitability that you will start is a personal brand on social media.\nThis is no longer optional. You are a creator by nature. Employers are hiring based on individuals public resumes (a personal brand). The market is not and never will be saturated. We have returned to 5th century BC where the power is back in the individuals hands rather than organizations or corporations. With the influx of ideas and information that lead to uncertainty and anxiety \u2014 it is up to the individual to take responsibility for constructing their life. Opposed to having religion, corporate culture, or other organizations create certainty in your life.\nThe best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) January 29, 2019\nWhy am I so adamant on starting a personal brand? Because building an audience and leverage was the greatest thing I ever did for myself.\nYou can practice any creative or marketable skill in the real world.\nWant to learn copywriting and persuasion? Follow the 3 steps to rapid learning above and practice by writing emails and tweets.\nWant to learn email marketing, web design, sales, or any other skill? Build an email list, build a personal website, and DM people to get on sales calls to increase the value of your personal brand (and make some money along the way.\nI\u2019m rambling a bit, let\u2019s get actionable. Here is the 3 point business model (for personal brands):\n1) Start a weekly newsletter.\nWhy? Because most people are playing the short-form content game with no authority to show for it.\nAuthority comes from depth and expertise. What better way to build that authority than making a high quality newsletter the main pillar of your business?\n95% of my sales come from my long form content. It builds trust that others can\u2019t compete with.\n2) Start a twitter account.\nWhy?\nYou don\u2019t have to show your face (if you don\u2019t want to)\nYou don\u2019t have to create fancy designs\nYou don\u2019t have to spend hours creating content\nAll you need is half a brain and the ability to type.\nAnyone can write less than 280 characters and press \u201csend tweet.\u201d\nOther benefits of Twitter:\nThe retweet is arguably the most powerful share feature \u2014 if you can connect with others and leverage their audience with retweets, you can grow quick.\nYou can post links anywhere \u2014 meaning you have more creative potential for promoting your products and newsletter (to make more sales)\nYou can condense your weekly newsletter into a thread \u2014 threads are how you gain followers fast.\nNobody cares about professionalism. If I had to bet on one platform that will be the center of the creator economy, Twitter would be it (just look at how everyone copy and pastes tweets to other platforms, they usually go more viral than posts that took hours to create).\nYou can test ideas fast since creating Twitter content takes very little time. If a tweet does well, that means a YouTube video, product, service, podcast episode, article, or Instagram post will do well.\nThere is zero barrier of entry to this.\n3) A creative solution to iterate on.\nThe easiest way to start making money is by starting a service business related to your expertise.\nYou can help people for free at the start, get some results, and start charging $500-$1000 for a pack of 4 consulting calls.\nGood at web development? Write for developers, connect with them, and charge to mentor them on a project they are building.\nGood at marketing? Write for creators, connect with them, and charge to consult them on any aspect of their marketing.\nThe list goes on \u2014 you can do this with anything. I know some people that do it for marijuana therapy and some people that do it for Muay Thai online coaching. I\u2019ve seen people offer surf lessons and critiques as well.\nThere is a progression to this.\nYou begin to collect dots that will turn into a creative solution or system that you can sell at a premium.\nThis is where most people go wrong \u2014 they want to go straight into selling $5,000 coaching packages or $3,0000/month marketing retainers when they have no idea how to create a unique system that gets results (and makes you stand out from the crowd).\nExample of a unique solution that I\u2019ve discovered myself (that I could charge $5K+ per month for):\nWhile everyone is trying to sell sales funnels, lead generation, and other things that are extremely common now \u2014 I have enough experience and practice with all of those.\nI\u2019ve recently created a content ecosystem (that I teach in Digital Economics) that pulls in sales without being salesy. It allows you to focus on what you love (producing high quality content) and streamlines promotions, social media growth, and authority building. That is 10x more enticing than a \u201cconversion centered website,\u201d sales funnel, or lead generation \u2014 I\u2019ve baked them all into one with my content ecosystem.\n(I am not saying conversion centered websites or sales funnels are bad. They are a part of the ladder. You just won\u2019t be able to charge the premium price that you want to without practice and iteration).\nWork your way up the ladder.\nFocus on helping people for free to understand their problems.\nStart researching, writing about, and creating solutions to solve those problems.\nBegin charging a low amount for a consulting or freelance service with this solution.\nContinue making your solution better and getting more results\nIncrease your prices\nWhile doing all of this, you are growing an audience \u2014 clients will start to come to you and you have the potential to launch a product\nYou can package up the system that you\u2019ve created into a digital product, market it well, and start to gain full control over your time and energy\nI could go on \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t make sense to you if you haven\u2019t started. It is common practice to teach from the perspective of the people that are 2-3 steps behind you. If I told you what I do now and you haven\u2019t even started \u2014 it will go straight over your head.\nIn a game, you have to be a specific level in order to learn specific traits, acquire high level armor, and take on more challenging quests.\nStop trying to get a level 100\u2019s results while you are level 10.\nDive into the unknown starting today. Start gaining XP in the real world.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nEarly enrollment for Digital Economics ends tonight at 7pm ET.\nIf you want to enroll in an accelerated education for future creatives, marketers, and solopreneurs (while learning the ins and outs of everything we talked about in this letter) \u2014 join 57 other students that have already enrolled in the June cohort before 7pm tonight.\nThe new YouTube video will be dropping tomorrow morning \u2014 it will be 45 minutes of diving into the Creation Pyramid.\nSubscribe here and turn on notifications to get it.\nJoey posted a training in MMHQ for starting your newsletter with Convertkit.\nKoe Letter readers can join for $5."

        "content": "I was observant as a child.\nI knew there had to be a better way of living.\nIt seemed like every corner I looked\u2026 people were unhappy.\nUnhappy with their careers, boss, spouse, children, colleagues, self, mornings, nights, everything.\nThis may just be the environment I was exposed to or what my mind gravitated towards, but something made me want to avoid this \u201cdefault\u201d lifestyle like the plague.\nComplaining about the cards I was dealt wasn\u2019t going to change my future.\nTaking matters into my own hands was the only option.\nPersonal responsibility, self-education, and the pursuit of sovereignty is what I dedicated my sub-20-year-old life to.\nIf everyone was told to watch the news, go to college, get a job, retire at 65, and do as they\u2019re told \u2014 would that not lead to everyone getting the same results?\nIs that not the cause of this global unhappiness?\nThere was only one option: Do the exact opposite of everyone else.\nWhile everyone glued their eyes to the TV, I glued my eyes to online educators.\nWhile everyone sat on the couch after work, I went to the gym straight after school.\nWhile everyone let toxic mainstream news flood their mind, I read books on spirituality and actualizing my full potential.\nThe Bane Of My Existence: The Conventional Career Path\nOne thing that I was truly excited to do was go to college. I knew that it would give me a chance to let me to try new things, meet new people, and ultimately:\nDelay the amount of time I had to build a sustainable income source for myself.\nThe minute that I set foot on the ASU campus I knew that I had started a timer.\nIt was do or die time. I had to learn the skills necessary to make an income without a job, or end up the same as everyone else. If I had to get a job, I knew that 8-hour days and energy-draining work would leave little room for me to break free of that job.\nI was hell-bent on trying different business models.\nIn freshman year, I started a fitness YouTube channel with my buddy that lived in the dorm room 3 doors down from mine.\nWe made workout videos, educational videos, and food challenges (like this unlisted 10,000 calorie challenge I did).\nAfter a few months, we decided to call it quits. I didn\u2019t do much else during freshman year aside from partying, playing video games, taking graphic design, marketing, film, and other classes to see what I was truly interested in.\nAround that time, my group of friends and I were arrested for smoking weed in the parking structure across from our dorm building. I got to take a ride with the not-so-kind police officer, give him my fingerprints, and have him interrogate me about where I got the weed (funny story that we\u2019ll dive into another time).\nThis is an important turning point in my life. I had forgotten about my goals of avoiding the conventional career path. When I went home for the summer, I got a letter from the court in the mail that gave me 2 options:\nGo to court, defend my case, and possibly be a convicted felon\nPay ~$5-10,000 for a program that made me pee in a cup every week for 3-6 months\nThis scared the sh*t out of me. I hid the letter from my parents and dealt with my emotional turmoil in silence.\nThis was the moment I purchased The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I glued my eyes to the page hoping it would ease some of my suffering \u2014 and it did. This was one of the times where I genuinely stopped caring. I let go. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen.\nI regained that drive to blaze my own path, started making YouTube videos again (talking head videos, kind of like Elliot Hulse at the time), and continued learning about spirituality along the way.\nAs with every other business model I tried, it didn\u2019t work out.\nFailing, Failing, and Failing Again\nIn sophomore year of college, I picked up photography. I watched YouTube videos like mad to educate myself, used my summer job money to buy a camera, and shot pics of whatever I could. Skyscrapers downtown, landscapes after a long hike, macro shots of nature.\nI didn\u2019t really care for taking pictures, what I really loved was editing. That realization shot me down a Photoshop learning rabbit hole and come junior year of college I committed to posting some of my edits on Instagram.\nI spent 6-8 hours at a time glued to my computer working to actualize a surreal image I had in my head. These were some of the results:\nMost of these were just mashups of stock images, some had my own photos (like the buildings and plane).\nI never planned to make an income from this \u2014 but I ended up gaining around 2500 followers on Instagram. I got bored of the whole digital art thing after a few months, but it taught me the importance of graphic design, visual storytelling, and opened my mind to the possibility of growing on social media with quality content.\nIf I had the awareness I do now, I could have easily created a course teaching people how to make these compositions.\nThat same year, I tried a few more business models.\n1) A Facebook Ads Agency\nI bought a course that taught me the fundamentals of landing clients, creating facebook ads, and advertising local businesses.\nI gave up after sending around 50 cold emails and never landing a client after 2-3 sales calls.\n2) A Rave Clothing Dropshipping Store\nI went to my first rave and was exposed to the whole EDM scene in sophomore year (hence my obsession with dubstep for focused work and gym music). I knew the industry like the back of my hands and knew there was a demand for fancy (and skimpy) clothes. Especially during \u201cfestival season.\u201d\nI bought an eCom course that taught me branding, copywriting, Shopify, and how to find \u201cgood products.\u201d\nI used my previous Facebook ads knowledge, spent ~$100 on ads, and made one sale of a shiny bra (lol).\nThe first online dollar felt amazing, but I felt like a piece of garbage having people wait 30 days for the product to be shipped from China.\n3) Freelance Web Design\nThis is where things get spicy. At this time \u2014 in senior year \u2014 I was living with 6 other guys in an old frat house. Yes\u2026 6 guys in one house. There were 2 master bedrooms that people split.\nI took an intro to web development course that launched me into an entire new phase of life. I loved coding. I skipped class, studied Udemy courses, took free coding classes, and ended up learning the entire college course curriculum in about a month. I didn\u2019t show up to 95% of the classes and was still top of that class.\nPart of the reason I loved it so much is that I knew I could freelance with that skill and at minimum get a job whether I graduate or not.\nI tried my hand at freelancing, reached out to friends and family, built some portfolio sites, and landed a few cheap clients (I made around $500 total).\nThat was senior year \u2014 my time was running out.\nI had to make something work or succumb to my fate of \u201cgetting a real job.\u201d\n4) Two Ecommerce Brands\nI decided to combine my branding, web development, graphic design, and advertising skills into one and create a real brand.\nI knew that developers were stuck at a screen all day \u2014 and this is around the time blue light glasses were gaining mainstream popularity \u2014 so I called my dad.\n\u201cHey pops\u2026 question for ya\u2026 can I uhhhhhh borrow a few thousand dollars? I promise I\u2019ll pay you back, here\u2019s my entire plan for getting rich, makes sense right?\u201d\nMy dad probably thought I was insane, but he believed in me, something I am truly grateful for \u2014 not many have this opportunity. I couldn\u2019t waste it.\nI looked for the perfect product, ordered them, waited 30 days for them to show up, took product pictures (with my photography skills!), and started paying for ads and influencer shoutouts.\nHere\u2019s one of my ad images:\nYes. That\u2019s a hedgehog. His name was Momo. Very cuddly despite his spiky demeanor. He ended up getting sick \u2014 and after multiple efforts to syringe feed him \u2014 he passed away.\nRIP Momo.\nThe glasses were great. I was proud of the product. But I was just shoveling money down the drain on ads at this point. I learned about influencer promotions, paid a meme page to post an ad, and have everyone in the comments calling me a clown. That hurt, I quit once again.\nThis sparked another major low point in my life, similar to when I got arrested.\nI had wasted my dads money, maxed out my first credit card, and could not see the light. I was doomed.\nThe only logical option was to accept my fate, use my previously learned coding skills, and opt for plan B of getting a job.\nLuckily enough, I got a web design job fairly quickly. It was a cushy job that taught me about what it really takes to run a web design agency. I used my free time there to try to land clients and saw some success.\nNow that I had money coming in, I decided to try out another eCommerce brand. This time with minimalist wallets (that my friends and I still use to this day, they were top quality.)\nI even invested quite a bit in professional product pics:\nAgain\u2026 didn\u2019t make a sale, wasted money, and got tired of it.\nThis is when I went all-in on freelancing.\nThere was a blurry moment throughout all of this where I also tried an SEO agency, content marketing agency, and was still kinda trying to find clients for anything I could get my hands on, mostly web design.\nAll of the skills I had developed up until this point could not fail me.\nNothing Makes Sense, Then Everything Makes Sense\nEven though I had a decent-paying job, my inner child was still screaming at me to live up to my promise.\nI may not have been able to avoid a job altogether, but I could sure as hell get out of it before other life responsibilities started to pile up.\nI walked into local businesses, reached out to my network again, tried LinkedIn prospecting, and everything else.\nI was able to land 2-3 clients a month at $1500-$2500 from this.\nWhen I learned more about the businesses I was helping (mostly service businesses) I had learned a bit about email marketing and copywriting.\nI pivoted my offer and started creating simple service funnels.\nA landing page, opt-in, and email sequence that would get calls booked for people like contractors, lawyers, accountants, pest control, and anyone else that were already getting leads but wanted to convert more into calls and customers.\nThis is when I started increasing my prices (because it was a more specific offer that got better results).\nI was charging $2500-$5000 to set this funnel up. It took me less time to build that than it did a full blown website.\nAgain, this is a bit blurry, but this is the time where I quit my job.\nIt wasn\u2019t as exciting as I thought it would be\u2026\nA few months later I took to Twitter, started posting content, and planned out a freelancing product while trying to land web design / funnel clients there. This is when my niche shifted towards creators, coaches, and freelancers. I knew them well, liked working with them, and could get them some killer results.\nOver the last 4 years, I built out products, pivoted my brand, tested different offers, and here we are now.\nHere\u2019s a soft timeline:\nI hit 6 figures freelancing\nI built out my freelancing product, grew my audience, and started making an extra ~$3,000 per month in info products\nI created a complimentary product that teaches web design\nI hit 10,000 followers on Twitter and created a product on how I grew + landed clients on Twitter (this bundle of courses is now inside MMHQ \u2013 Koe Letter readers can join for $5)\nI launched a physical planner, got tired of physical product e-commerce and shipping out of my house, and made a digital version free (The Power Planner)\nI hit 6 figures in digital product sales\nI pivoted my freelance offer into a marketing consulting offer \u2014 because creators like to do things themselves, and it freed up more time\nI built Modern Mastery HQ\nI hit my first $50K month and was pulling in a consistent $300-$500K a year as a one-person business\nModern Mastery grew to 1000 members\nI\u2019ve stopped consulting and am launching Digital Economics \u2014 my school for rapid skill acquisition, audience building, content creation, and the rest \u2014 on June 14th (less than 2 weeks!)\nNothing happens. Then everything happens.\nWe will be going over this business progression (and what I would do differently if you are just starting out) in the next Koe Letter.\n7 Rapid Fire Lessons Learned From A Decade Of Failure\nI\u2019ve learned many lessons from this journey, but here are a few that I find most impactful:\n1) Nothing Makes Sense, Then Everything Makes Sense\nI will let this tweet speak for the paradox that is life:\nThe perfect idea always comes after a period of feeling lost. Nothing makes sense, then everything makes sense. It\u2019s cyclical and unavoidable. Enjoy it.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) June 2, 2022\n2) Figure It Out\nAnything is possible. It really is. You have infinite opportunities and education at your fingertips. You may not see it because you haven\u2019t opened your mind to that possibility.\nNever stop learning. You should always have a project you are working on while educating yourself on how to build out that project. That\u2019s how you learn fast.\n3) Don\u2019t Be Afraid To Start Over\nLife goes on. If the current business you are trying to build isn\u2019t bringing results (and you just don\u2019t see yourself doing it for life) then go a different route.\nTry something new. Go get drunk with some friends and have an epiphany on what you need to do next (take this with a grain of salt lol).\n4) Embrace The Uncertain And Unknown Path\nNothing worth having is predictable. If you are reading this, you weren\u2019t meant for the conventional path that everyone goes down. You know there is more to all of this \u2014 and hopefully I have opened you up to the possibility of more in your life.\nUncertainty will have you in your head, a lot. Embrace this. Muscle is built from resistance, tension, and ample recovery.\n5) Try Everything\nBuy books. Follow advice on social media. Try every business model imaginable. Post content online.\nYour job is to find the problem you love solving, what you love talking about, and how those intersect. That is how you start to uncover your life\u2019s work.\n6) Give Give Give\nAt the start, work for free. Build out projects for yourself. Build out projects for your friends. Build out projects for imaginary businesses. Get on calls with people. Network on Twitter.\nGive out all of the value you have with no expectation of being repaid. Good things will come.\n7) Shoot Your Shot \u2014 Then Shoot Again\nThere is absolutely nothing holding you back from putting yourself out there except for yourself.\nGet used to being denied.\nWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? You have to try again? You get to learn another valuable lesson? You become that much more accurate with your shot?\nShoot.\nThank you for reading \u2014 I hope this brought some inspiration into your life.\nInspiration is powerful.\nDon\u2019t waste it.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nA new YouTube video on how to stop caring what people think went live.\nWatch here.\nA podcast on niching down and creating your own reality went up.\nListen here.\nA new challenge, article about authenticity as a creator, and this months training with Dakota Robertson on starting a ghostwriting business was scheduled inside of MMHQ.\nJoin here for $5.\nMy school for rapid modern skill acquisition, branding, and creating a content ecosystem that will bring you high paying gigs as a creative, marketer, or solopreneur starts on June 14th.\nSecure a discounted spot before the 11th here."

        "content": "If I could attribute all of my progress to one thing \u2014 it would be clarity. The ability to order consciousness, that is. Clarity makes focus seamless, and we all know how important that is in the age of information.\nAs a kid, under 12 years old, I would carry a notebook with me everywhere. One of those \u201ccollege-rule\u201d notebooks that you would go school shopping for. Except this one wasn\u2019t for school. This is where I drew weird monsters, robots, and anything else that my young mind could imagine.\nThese drawings were usually the same shape. A humanoid creature with a body, arms, legs, and a head. Sometimes I would make them muscular, sometimes skinny and alien-like, sometimes with horns, sometimes with halos.\nAs I grew up, I stopped drawing but kept the notebook around. Instead of imaginary figures, I wrote imaginary scenarios for my future. A vision board, if you will. A map of steps I needed to take to get there. I would pin these to my wall above my computer. Whenever I was feeling especially lazy, my vision would stare me in the face \u2014 reminding me why I am here.\nTurning Dreams (Or Nightmares) Into Reality\nAwareness begets awareness. Thoughts beget thoughts. Ideas beget ideas. Projects beget projects\u2026 I can go on.\nThe point: you cannot create a future reality for yourself if you have not first imagined it.\nVice versa, you can only create a negative present reality if you have first imagined it (or experienced it).\nTesla \u2014 the company \u2014 would not be here if the wheel, wagon, carriage, electricity, and car came before it.\nThis brings up what could be the biggest problem we are experiencing as a species. And of course, we are the only ones who experience it, because we are the only species alive that has the cognitive ability TO experience it.\nI am talking about psychological time or the concept of linear time. That is the big problem. Reminiscing on a familiar past \u2014 something you have physically experienced before \u2014 and having the same familiar thoughts. Those thoughts pull your past experience into the present. You literally have the same sensory experience. You ARE your past self.\nAs you repeat these thoughts, emotions, and experiences \u2014 your brain hardwires these patterns via neural networks. This is how habits and routines are formed. These are dangerous when unconscious. You remain the person you were in the past. Living out the same negative thoughts and sensory experiences over and over again. We have to learn how to program (internal) or be programmed (external). Create or be created.\nThe same thing happens with the future. You project into and stress over the predictable future based on your past experiences. Again, you feel those experiences in the present, meaning you haven\u2019t changed throughout your entire unconscious life.\nThere is a specific neural network for each of these. One for the stress your boss causes. One for getting in the shower. One for arguing with your spouse when you get home. As time goes on, these become more unconscious and disastrous.\nMost people wake up and immediately project into a stressful future because of their programming. They wake up as a past version of themselves, having the same exact negative sensory experience they have every morning.\nThe only way to solve this problem is by diving into the unknown. Thinking new thoughts. Exposing yourself to new ideas. Immersing yourself in an environment conducive to growth (my notion of tactical stress). Building projects that lead to a positive potential reality. Taking unfamiliar actions that you have been told were \u201crisky\u201d \u2014 because the people saying that haven\u2019t experienced the \u201crisk\u201d itself.\n90+% of the population are a walking contradiction. They live out a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ccertain\u201d path on autopilot \u2014 which holds the most risk and uncertainty in our ever-changing world.\nThe Greatest Skill Of The 21st Century\nThe mind can cause a lot of problems as we\u2019ve learned. This is because of psychic entropy \u2014 the mind tending towards chaos and disorder. This is not bad if you understand how to navigate these phases. They can be very rewarding. However, the solution is clarity. Ordered consciousness. The ability to organize information in a way that quite literally brings it to life. From mind to matter.\nNobody knows what they want to do in life. Nobody sees this as a blessing. Not knowing what you want means you get to create what you want in the infinite potential of the unknown. We will dive more into the science behind the quantum realm in a future letter. Just know, the unknown is where all potential exists. If it is known, that potential has already been actualized. You need to break the habit of living as your known, familiar, and predictable self in your known, familiar, and predictable life.\nNow, understand that this is a BIG topic. Everything in the pyramid above deserves its own letter. People have written entire books on all of the different aspects of the pyramid. Hell, I\u2019m writing an entire book on it. We will not be able to understand this all in one post. All future and prior posts incorporate this.\nIn this letter, we are focused on ordering consciousness to create a positive reality for ourselves. Here are the steps to do that:\n1) Material VS Immaterial Experience\n\u201cI am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.\u201d \u2014 Carl Jung\nDo not interpret this quote from a materialist paradigm. Think of it from an immaterial, experiential perspective. You ARE who you choose to become. Right now. In this very moment. There is no gap to bridge in the immaterial world.\nWhen you tap into optimal experience, or the flow state, you are having the sensory experience that you crave. You do not care about the fancy car, house, or lifestyle. You care about the feeling or experience it gives you.\nYou can achieve that experience right now.\nUnpopular opinion: \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d is incredible advice.\nFrom a material perspective, it makes you look like a fraud. From an immaterial perspective, there is no faking. You already are that person. The material world will catch up.\n2) Create A Crystal Clear Vision\nHow do we dive into the unknown? Through the power of our mind to visualize the potential reality we want to attract and work towards through intention.\nFun fact: \u201cIntention\u201d comes from Latin intentionem (nominative intentio) \u201ca stretching out, straining, exertion, effort; attention,\u201d noun of action from intendere \u201cto turn one\u2019s attention,\u201d literally \u201cto stretch out\u201d\nWhen you act with intention (a driver in The Creation Pyramid) \u2014 you are stretching towards something through attention.\nMany people talk bad about the \u201cLaw Of Attraction\u201d but think of it like this: through consistent and specific visualization, you are framing your focus. When you practice focusing on your vision (instead of your boss causing you stress) you begin to deprogram the unconscious thought patterns in your brain.\nAnother example: if you believe you can make money online (because you have clarity on your vision) you will start to notice money-making opportunities. Like when you see a certain car that you haven\u2019t seen before \u2014 then you see it EVERYWHERE. You are actively opening your mind to pay attention to new, unknown things and \u201cattracting\u201d those experiences into your life.\nBy getting specific on how you want your future to look \u2014 you can start to tap into that energy.\nEnergy? Like vibes? What do you mean?\nHave you ever \u201clooked forward\u201d to going on vacation and gotten excited in that present moment? That\u2019s what I mean. Environments hold energy. Nature holds energy. Everything holds energy. The frequency of certain energy is information. Our brains process and organize information. Stop thinking about all of this from a materialist paradigm.\nYou can use my free planner if you want a guided way of doing all of this.\n3) Reverse Engineer Your Vision Into Goals\nThe purpose of creating goals isn\u2019t to focus on them, but to provide more clarity and prove that it can be accomplished. You can think of these as micro-visions if you want. They are simply here to provide additional energy sources to tap into and be able to create a process to execute on when it\u2019s time to actualize your vision.\nEverything here is variable. That\u2019s why this is such a large and difficult topic to tackle. I am trying to guarantee success in a world where success is reserved for the 1% that understand The Creation Pyramid.\nHow I have done it is break it down into 3 goals depending on the scale of what you are trying to create. If you are trying to create a better life, think big. Write out a 10 year goal, 1 year goal, and monthly goal.\nNow we can complete these quests, milestones, checkpoints, or \u201cmicro-visions\u201d by executing on a specific process.\n4) Begin Testing A Process\nThink of all of this phase as an experiment. You don\u2019t know what will get results unless you test specific parts. Scientists don\u2019t come up with a replicable process that gets results the first time around. It may take weeks, months, or years.\nPatience, faith, and surrender is necessary here. You are creating a reality that nobody has created before. If you want to go back to the \u201csecure,\u201d predictable, and conventional path of living, be my guest. If not, open yourself up to failure.\nWhat lever-moving actions can you execute on everyday that will actualize the monthly, yearly, decade-long, and life-long vision for the reality you are working to attract and create?\nIf this part makes you anxious, you will need to self-educate and practice to increase your skill. If this part makes you bored, you will need to increase the challenge.\n5) Leverage Intrinsic Drivers\nCuriosity, passion, purpose, inspiration, and intention are all tools at your disposal to improve the quality of your work.\nThese all influence dopamine and other neurochemicals in your brain. When you are inspired through curiosity pursuit, you do better work. When you have a strong why or purpose, you do better work. These are energy sources that you can tap into at any time.\nThese should be intrinsic motivators, not extrinsic.\n6) Control & Channel Your Attention\nThis deserves an entire post in itself. For now, understand that you can tap into the energy from any level of the pyramid. These are all options to free up creative energy.\nAttention gives and receives energy. We process the information that comes from frequencies, but can only process it if attention is given to it.\nWhen you give unconscious attention to negative energy \u2014 like visualizing a stressful scenario with your boss at work \u2014 you tap into that energy source. There is an exchange of energy and you feel that energy going to waste.\nBy managing your attention, you free up energy to put maximum effort into your vision.\nWhen in doubt, bring your attention to the present moment. Expand your awareness. Open your focus. And tap into the infinite potential and positivity that the unknown holds.\nExample Breakdown:\nOne aspect of your vision for the future is to make 6 figures with a creative skillset. We can get more specific, and you should, but let\u2019s break it down into goals:\n10 year goal: make 6 figures creating content selling design tutorials (4 clients at $2250 per month OR 84 sales of a $99 course)\n1 year goal: make $60,000 with graphic design mentoring and plan out a course\n1 month goal: land one consulting client at $1,000\nNow we need a process to focus on for making that a reality:\nPost 3 tweets a day to build authority and a public resume\nDM 10 people that interact with my posts and run them through a DM outreach soft-script\n1 timeline promotion per day for your product or service\nNow, tap into certain intrinsic drivers. Even better, bake it into your routine with my free creative process.\nFrame your focus further by blocking off 1 hour every day to execute this process.\nBecoming Multi-Dimensionally Jacked\nThe Creation Pyramid is not only for creating a better life for yourself. It can be applied to all dimensions of your personal and professional life.\nStarting a new project?\nCreate a vision for it, gain clarity with goal setting, reduce the friction of taking action, and focus.\nHow about creating a better relationship?\nCreate a vision for how you want the interaction with your significant other to go, gain clarity on how to make that happen, and frame your attention.\nStarting an online business with a personal brand?\nThis is how you create your brand.\nYour vision is the desired outcome you are helping others reach. The goals to get there are what you educate your audience on. Your drive is what attracts like-minded people. Capturing attention and framing the focus of your audience is how you help them navigate roadblocks.\nBonus: create a vision board of images that you like. I like black and white skyscrapers (I used to dream of living in a big city, and black and white is just my style) can you see that in my brand?\nWhat about the feeling you want to convey? What environment, profile pictures, colors, and other forms of information that humans process through attention do you want to convey? It\u2019s about the experience.\nThe same thing goes for creating a product or service. What is the desired outcome? How do they get there? What is the process that gets results that you walk them through? Are they able to focus and actually achieve those results? Are you making it seamless for them?\nThe next time you feel lost in any dimension \u2014 mind, body, spirit, business, and the rest \u2014 refer to the creation pyramid to gain clarity and create the reality you want to live in.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nMy school for future full-time creatives, marketers, & solopreneurs \u2014 Digital Economics \u2014 starts June 14th.

        "content": "As a kid, video games fascinated me. I remember begging my mom to buy me my first \u201crated M\u201d game Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, because all of my friends were already playing it. She caved. I spent my nights slamming Dr. Peppers, cursing kids out in the pre-game lobby, falling asleep at 2am \u2014 just to wake up an hour before school started to play one more match.\nYou could call me addicted. Moreso, obsessed.\nAs time went on, I built my first PC. A fun little hobby that opened an entire new world of games I could play. League Of Legends and World Of Warcraft were my thing. For what seems like 5 years, I was glued to my screen every night (after I hit the gym! It was my \u201ctreat.\u201d).\nI will not be the guy that tells you to stop playing video games. I made it out just fine \u2014 and I see my time playing them as a net benefit to my life. I no longer play them \u2014 but there are many lessons to pull from my time as a gamer.\nWhy We Become Obsessed\nWhy do we become so obsessed with games? A few reasons.\nThe mind craves order. It despises chaos. Humans pursue a hierarchy of goals to maintain mental order. This can be conscious or unconscious. Assigned or created. Both leaders and manipulators know this. Corporate workplaces have daily goals, weekly goals, yearly goals, and personal goals that they assign to you. This reduces the uncertainty of what you need to do daily. Culture and politics have goals. Political leaders get you to rally behind their vision for the world, bring clarity to how they are going to accomplish that (goals), and ask for your vote.\nWant to add more firepower to this? Use storytelling. As we\u2019ve discussed in previous letters, all understanding is metaphorical. Story based. One thing has to come before another. This word has to come before this word in order for this word to make sense to you. One goal has to come before another in order for it to make sense. Understand the perspective \u2014 the metaphorical world \u2014 that people are talking about before the rest makes sense. That is to say you need to understand the setting of the story. What\u2019s next? The rising action. Then a battle of the protagonist and antagonist. Then the falling action and resolution.\nWhen we don\u2019t understand something, our mind fills in the blanks of the story. This is called an assumption. You don\u2019t have a piece of the puzzle, so you imagine it based on your experiences. Your programming. This is dangerous, and often useless. A distraction from what is truly important to you.\nThis causes obsession. When something makes little sense to us \u2014 we have the urge to make sense of it. In order to make sense of it, we need to uncover the rest of the story. We want to understand what came before, after, and in between.\nTransferring Obsession \u2014 The Key To Extreme Success & Not Caring What People Think\nArnold was obsessed. Walt Disney was obsessed. Elon IS obsessed. Joe Rogan IS obsessed. Did they care what others thought of them? Did they care about the people calling them crazy? No. They were hyper-focused on actualizing an idea that they were passionate about, regardless of the short-term payout.\nObsession, to me, signals ordered consciousness. A difficult-to-distract state of clarity. Some call it flow, others call it presence. We can label it all day, in reality \u2014 it just feels good.\n\u201cTo make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something.\u201d \u2014 Naval Ravikant\nWhat story do you want to understand? What is the tip of the iceberg that sparks excitement in you? Dive deep into that. This is where most people go wrong. They deny themselves the permission to dive into an iceberg of opportunity.\nA recent example. I came across an Alan Watts 2-part lecture called \u201cYou Are God.\u201d That sparked excitement in me. It was a novel perspective that caught my attention. Wtf? I\u2019m God? How is that possible? So rather than closing my mind to a new idea (like most people in the pre-rational and rational stages of development would) I dissected it. I had to piece together the story. What led him to saying that? Horizontal and vertical questioning. Since then, I\u2019ve listened to the lecture 10+ times, noticed his teachings in other content I am consuming (like Actualized.org lectures on God Consciousness), was able to make connections (pattern recognition) and at least gain some form of understanding.\nI still don\u2019t understand it fully, but that\u2019s the fun in it, no? Will we ever explore every square inch of the iceberg we are obsessed with?\nNow, all of this obsession stuff is great, but how do we obsess in the right direction? A direction that will lead to extreme success?\n\u201cFollow your obsessions until a problem starts to emerge, a big meaty challenging problem that impacts as many people as possible, that you feel hellbent to solve or die trying.\u201d \u2014 Justine Musk\nObsession, in my eyes, is associated with the flow state. People that naturally become obsessed with things are entering the flow state over time and labeling it as obsession. Entering the flow state is a science. I want to introduce you to 2 things.\n1) Steven Kotler\u2019s 5 Intrinsic Drivers\nThe 5 intrinsic drivers are curiosity, passion, purpose, autonomy, and mastery. We have discussed this before \u2014 but I want to bring your attention to the \u201cpurpose\u201d driver.\nYou cultivate passion by pursuing your curiosity and making connections at the intersections of your curiosities. Purpose is born when these \u201cintersections\u201d gain real world utility. What is a big problem that you want to solve in the world? How can your curiosities solve that big problem? Don\u2019t know? Cool, now you have things to research and rabbit holes to go down.\nMy purpose is to end human suffering. That lights a fire in me. I am doing that by studying philosophy, business, spirituality, and other things that allow me to spread my message. I am obsessed with this. Random opinions mean nothing because I can bring my focus back to my purpose. This is key.\n2) Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s Flow Model\nThere is a progression to following obsession. It is a balance of challenge and skill.\nYou can kick into degrees of the flow state at any given moment. You need a desired outcome, clarity on how to get there, and a challenge that matches your skill.\nOptimal Experience\nIf you are pursuing a specific goal (desired outcome) and the journey is boring, you need to increase the challenge. If the journey makes you anxious, you need to increase your skill. You do this through self-education via the internet.\nThis will make sense soon.\nMid Koe Letter Plug: If you want access to 170+ social media growth, monetization, branding, marketing, sales, and performance strategies \u2014 join 1000+ members inside MMHQ.

Games give you a structured, goal or quest oriented way of achieving a desired outcome \u2014 the happy ending of a story.\nEverything is a game if you perceive it as a game. Games imply rules, skill, challenge, and milestones. We can consciously create these. This is how you predict obsession and give yourself something worth focusing on. That is to say, something worth caring about so you can stop caring about the things that don\u2019t matter.\nWhen done correctly, other\u2019s opinions, modern distractions, personal insecurity, and potential mediocrity stop existing. They only existed in the first place because you gave them your attention.\nHumans are divine creators. When we are tapped into optimal experience, flow, or the present \u2014 we open up room for creation.\nLet\u2019s create our own game:\nCreating Your Reality\nAs humans, we create our own reality. Your reality is based on your perspective and perception. That is how we make sense of the non-sensical. It\u2019s all labels, symbols, words, and interpretations strung together into a story. It\u2019s all imaginary \u2014 as the only thing there is is the present moment. Psychological time \u2014 the past and future \u2014 are just parts of the story that you remember. The points in time that you were conscious of. The 1 out of 7 billion perspectives you had at that point in time.\nIf you want any situation to be in your favor \u2014 shift your perspective to a point where you can create an advantageous perception of the situation. Perspective is the camera, perception is the lens. Most people have a camera on a tripod with a blurred lens. They won\u2019t move their camera or try to unblur their lens. This leads to the inability to see the situation for what it is.\nLet\u2019s say you are in a busy coffee shop and see an attractive person. Where does your mind go? I guarantee it will be from a faulty perspective, one that doesn\u2019t serve you. Your mind will start making excuses.\n\u201cWhat if she denies me and everyone notices? That would be embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she has a boyfriend? I shouldn\u2019t even risk it.\u201d\nEvery excuse imaginable will flood your head. Notice these thoughts, pause, breath, and see the situation for what it is. If you approach the girl and she denies you, the situation is over. Everyone is off in their own little reality. They won\u2019t care in 5 seconds and you will probably never see them again.\nThis goes for anything. Afraid to speak in front of a camera and post it online? What\u2019s the worst that happens? Somebody calls you a \u201cdweeb\u201d in the comment section? Does that comment warrior not have an entire life to live?\nDon\u2019t make one comment your entire world. Zoom out. Gain perspective.\nCreating Your Character\n\u201cI am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.\u201d \u2014 Carl Jung\nIn many video games, the first thing you do is create your character. The one that you want to play as. The character that you believe will play the game best. Pull out a pen and paper, this is where things get important.\nFrom my experience, the only way to stop playing the game is to win the game. If you want initial success in growing on social media \u2014 you need to play the game. Once you have enough leverage \u2014 once you reach max level \u2014 you can do whatever you want.\nWhat does the maxed out version of your character look like?\nWhat skills and traits will that character develop?\nHow much gold will that character earn?\nWhat is your vision for the future (desired outcome)? What are the steps to getting there (goals & clarity)?\nWriting Your Story\nLife unfolds in chapters and phases.\nIf you were to imagine a story of your life being written, what is being written right now? What chapter are you in? Are you the protagonist or antagonist? What battle are you fighting? Are you on the winning side? What perspective is this being written from? Did you care too much about asking the girl out at the coffee shop? If so, did you redeem yourself?\n\u201cHappiness is the feeling that power increases \u2013 that resistance is being overcome.\u201d \u2014 Nietzsche\nStories are how we create meaning in life. Meaning is found in the struggle, the battle, the resistance being overcome.\nAre you going to play to win? Or are you going to play to help others win? Are you going to pursue your own character\u2019s storyline? Or are you going to be an NPC in another characters storyline? It\u2019s all within your control.\nWinning The Game\nEverything is a game.\nSocial media growth, online business, confidence, self-improvement, skill acquisition, etc. Everything.\nYou start the game by learning the rules, mechanics, and principles.\nYou play the game by keeping your attention on an intrinsic hierarchy of goals.\nYou win the game by achieving those goals, gaining experience (XP), and maxing out your character\u2019s desired traits.\nThere is no way around this. You either play the game or get played by the game.\nThe only way you can stop playing is if you win.\n\u2014 Dan Koe\nWhat Happened This Week\nDigital Economics Founder\u2019s pricing is live \u2014 with 11 spots left.

        "heading": "How To Copy Your Way To Success (Instead Of Mediocrity)",
        "content": "When I read a new book, I know if I want to continue reading it based on one thing:\nI can feel certain areas of my brain lighting up. The words on the page dig into my soul and give me the answer I\u2019ve been looking for. My curiosity pulls me deeper and deeper. Rampant thoughts flood my mind, keeping me up past my bedtime (which has been around 9pm nowadays). I have to keep reading. I have to keep going down the rabbit hole. I have to learn anything and everything about this topic. I have to acquire all perspectives so I can artfully navigate future conversations.\nIf a book doesn\u2019t do that for me, I put it on the bookshelf for later. Why would I waste my time reading something that doesn\u2019t interest me? We have that reward mechanism in our head for a reason, right? To help us move in a positive life direction? To give us feedback on signal from noise? The one that so many use to drown themselves in dopamine? Video games, memes, masturbation, and any other fabricated replacement for pursuing your curiosity.\nThe real question; does this have utility? Can pursuing my interests carry real world value? Will my curiosity exploration have a purpose? Aside from making my brain feel good and expanding my depth of knowledge?\nLet\u2019s explore.\nYou Are A Copy Cat (By Design)\nFrom the beginning of time (as soon as time started for you, birth) you have been imitating \u2014 or copying \u2014 those around you. How else could you survive?\nAs a child, you imitated your parents. You learned to speak, walk, eat, and (hopefully) use the bathroom correctly. As you aged, culture came into play. The school system gave everyone the same curriculum. Your friends projected their opinions on you (that they imitated from their parents). As you progressed through the school system, the wonder chemical \u2014 dopamine \u2014 worked to separate signal from noise. You would imitate the things that lit up part of your brain.\nThis is not a problem. The problem reveals itself when attachment joins the party. These traits, biases, beliefs, values, and perspectives that we unconsciously adopted form our identity.\nThe mind hates disorder. It needs a hierarchy of goals to gain clarity and thrive. Your mind will construct a hierarchy of goals, whether or not you are conscious of it. Culture and corporate lifestyles all have goals, big and small, that direct the actions of the people. Go to school (goal 1), get a job (goal 2), retire (goal 3) \u2014 but at what cost?\nThe mind needs a story to latch onto and make sense of. The mind makes sense of the world by knowing what came before, and after. We have to know what happened in the psychological past in order to have a sense of certainty about the future. Without certainty \u2014 anxiety, stress, and the children of entropy take their reign.\nTo overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nIf someone is not aware of this imitation process, they attach to their identity \u2014 the layer of stories that helps their mind make sense of what they are. When their identity sees a threat, their survival radar goes off. Their worldview is threatened. The mind equates this threat of identity to potential death. Humans are the only people that do this. If there isn\u2019t a human to call it a phone, is it a phone? If there isn\u2019t a human to call me Dan, am I Dan? If there isn\u2019t a belief to make sense of this all \u2014 do I even exist?\nThis is yet another reason I recommend writing out and refining your vision. Having a hierarchy of goals that you create in alignment with a life that you want to live is important. A clear vision brings clarity to your daily actions. It brings order to your mind. It removes all stress and anxiety from your life \u2014 if that hierarchy of goals is intrinsically motivating (see: curiosity, passion, purpose, values, etc). You won\u2019t get this right at first. It is a lifelong process of experimenting, testing, and iterating. Write it down. Even if you think it will not work the first time around.\nThis is how you make the unconscious conscious.\nThe mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life. \u2014 Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\nSuccess is a game of intelligent imitation. Imitation can be harmful to our future \u2014 but imitation itself cannot be escaped. We are imitating everything around us. We process information we get exposed to and it is stored somewhere in our brain.\nTo make the most of this survival mechanism, we need to be conscious of what, and who we are imitating. If we are exposing ourself to a person, what is their message? Are they promoting negativity and limiting beliefs that you will adopt? Or are they promoting growth, education, and showing you how to move in a positive life direction? What is their hierarchy of goals and does it align with ours?\nOnce again, this is where curiosity comes into play. Pursuing your curiosities is how you imitate intelligently. How? The first step towards curiosity is \u201clistening\u201d \u2014 or feeling \u2014 the dopamine levels in your head. This is near impossible when you are distracted. Drowning in dopamine from cheap stimuli. Following the path that others assigned to you. Etc.\nYou Are A Perspective Vessel\nIntelligent Imitation\nEverything is perspective. Reality is perspective. Think of perspective as a camera and perception as the lens. Both combine to create your worldview. At the end of the day, everyone is trying to defend their perspective based on their worldview. You see it in the comment section, in the news, in arguments with your significant other, everywhere. This is a necessary practice; being able to zoom your camera out, see the big picture, and move your camera around the world. This is how you stop reacting to things that don\u2019t matter. You change your perspective in order to set yourself up for an advantageous perception. Finding a vantage point for advantageous perception (interpretation of the situation) is how you make positive decisions in your life.\nA side lesson on making better choices:\nTerrence was scrolling on social media. He saw a post that made him angry. A reaction that was caused by years of imitation, conditioning, and programming from the beliefs and opinions that were projected from other people\u2019s perspective.\nTerrance left a mean comment, felt the squirt of dopamine, and enjoyed the instant gratification that would come back to bite him. The comment sat there, made more people angry, and created a chain reaction of dopamine junkies enforcing their poor perspective in their heads.\nNow, imagine the power of a simple pause and reframe. If Terrence had shifted to a perspective that opened up room for curiosity, he could have pulled a positive lesson from what originally made him angry. Rather than assuming the full story, he accepted that the other person has a different perspective. A perspective composed of their own vision, goals, experiences, values, and everything else that would be impossible to assume.\nWith a simple pause, Terrence could have opened his mind to an opportunity that would shoot him in an entirely new life direction.\nBack to humans being perspective vessels (and how it relates to increasing your value):\nAttention is the new currency. Novelty is what grabs attention. Novel perspectives are what will make people listen to you over someone else. We talk a lot about entrepreneurship in The Koe Letter, but this stems far beyond that. Novel, positive perspectives are what make people remember you. Helping people make sense \u2014 connect the dots in their head \u2014 will mark your words in their brain.\nNovel perspectives make people hire you over the next person. They are the foundation of authenticity \u2014 giving your unique, intrinsic, and unfiltered perspective on the situation. Novel, well-thought-out perspectives are the key to seeing things for what they are \u2014 so you can use them to your advantage.\nIf you master the art of perspective, you master the game of mind.\nThe Intelligent Imitation Process\nThis is not only for entrepreneurship. Pursuing your curiosity, posting online, and building digital leverage is something everyone can do. Employers are actively hiring people that have a polished digital resume. A personal brand is a project that you can apply and test everything you learn on (making you learn faster). And as we talked about last week, the world is shifting back towards trust, simplicity, and individuality.\nYou build trust by being authentic. You express simplicity by distilling the information in a way that makes sense. You practice individuality by taking full responsibility for the outcome of your life.\nYou do all of the above by pursuing your curiosity, distilling what you learn, and posting about online through your unique perspective. (This is what I am doing right now).\nIf you want to start building a loyal audience, digital leverage, and start having opportunities come to you, here is my Intelligent Imitation Process for condensing & understanding knowledge.\nStep 1) Choose 3-5 \u201cmentors\u201d that you aspire to be like.\nYou become what you consume, so consume in accordance with who you want to become.\nMake this process easy by writing down the 3-5 names of the people that have changed your perspective.\nWhat is your favorite book that you recommend to everyone? Write down the authors name.\nWho is the YouTuber, podcaster, or blogger that you can\u2019t stop watching? The one that \u201cblows your mind\u201d every time they post?\nWhat social media accounts do you follow that make you think, \u201cHow did they say that so perfectly?\u201d\nBecause that\u2019s the thing\u2026 not everyone thinks that. Only you. The combination and connection of these \u201cmentors\u201d is how you create your own niche, perspective, and content that separates you from the crowd.\nRe-read the first chapter of your favorite books again \u2014 I guarantee your brain will light up.\nStep 2) Don\u2019t consume. Research.\nConsuming content implies that you aren\u2019t doing anything with it. You aren\u2019t using it (see: the universal Law of Use).\nWhen you adopt the perspective of a researcher, you see everything as an experiment. Everything you research gains utility. You test ideas, formulate theories by connecting the ideas, determine how that gets results in the real world, then turn them into replicable processes that gets results for others (this is what people sell under a personal brand, it is also how I came up with this process ;))\nI have a podcast called \u201cStop learning if you want to make more money\u201d that dives deeper into this.\nStep 3) Get in touch with yourself and write it down.\nYou can\u2019t be drowning in modern distractions if you want this to work. You must give room for dopamine to accurately distinguish signal from noise.\nAs you are researching in alignment with your curiosities, don\u2019t take notes. Wait for the novel perspective that catches your attention. Feel the excitement. Feel your focus narrow in and listen (or read) more carefully.\nThis is what you write down in your notes.\nStep 4) Dissect and distill.\nThis is the key to developing a unique perspective. In an experiment, you dissect something in order to learn about its parts. If you don\u2019t do this, all you will have is a shallow understanding of the topic (most people on social media do this). Shallow understanding prevents you from making deeper connections that separate you from the crowd.\nMy free 7 day creative challenge gives you a template for this process (and an in-depth guide to how I use it).\nHere is what you will do based on what you wrote in your notes:\nThe topic it relates to\nA brief summary of how you understand it.\nThe common problems associated with that topic.\nThe common benefits to overcoming those problems.\nObjections or limiting beliefs people have to solving those problems.\nPersonal experiences and stories you have with that topic\nA step-by-step process for overcoming that problem\nNow, after these are written down, you will summarize all of those into a one-sentence big idea. This will show you that you can create profound, quote-like sayings from your unique perspective.\n\u201cOkay, Dan, but what can I do with all of this information?\u201d\nIn essence, you have just created an outline for an article, video, thread, multiple tweets, a product, and landing page from a novel, persuasive perspective. Yes. I really did distill that all into one process.\nIf you have a basic education of marketing, sales, or content psychology \u2014 I know you can see the power in this.\nWhen you do this for few months, you build a web of genius ideas that have real world utility. Ideas that attract others. Ideas that can be monetized. Ideas that open up room for new ideas \u2014 accelerating human evolution. Yes, ideas are the exact thing that move human evolution forward. They stack on top of eachother. Remember\u2026 stories. One thing has to become before the other \u2014 a brilliant idea can literally change the direction of mankind\u2026 or just the direction of your life.\nIf you enjoyed this edition of The Koe Letter, consider sharing it with a friend.\nIf this letter was shared with you, you can subscribe here to get them straight in your inbox every Saturday morning."

        "heading": "There Will Only Be 1 Career Path In The Future",
        "content": "This past month, I have realized a common theme in my life (and the lives of many others).\nObsession.\nAs a kid, I was obsessed with finding a better way of living. I don\u2019t know what sparked this. All I know is that I was a silent observer. Everywhere we went, I paid close attention to people\u2019s actions. Not in a judgemental way, but in a discerning way.\nHow did that person get to that point in life? Why did they look that way? Was it because they were going through the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru every morning? 2 sausage and egg McMuffins with a large iced coffee (and don\u2019t forget the 3 extra pumps!)? Many things didn\u2019t sit well with me.\nOne of them was the conventional career path. Go to school. Think you know what you want to do at 18 years old (when in reality it\u2019s what culture conditioned you to do). Possibly get a good job the first time around. Possibly enjoy life while having no control over 70% of your day. Possibly have the freedom to do whatever you want with your time\u2026 at 65 years old. Sign me up!\nNope. Didn\u2019t like that. A \u201csecure\u201d future didn\u2019t sound so secure. So I spent my time in the gym, learning from people I aspired to be like on social media, learning whatever skill could help me, and failing at 7+ business models.\nSide note: I found this was a missing piece in my brand. So I am launching Digital Economics on June 7th. It will be a modern business degree (taught by someone who actually understands modern online business). Skill acquisition, brand building, rapid content creation, and creating your own niche that nobody can compete with (in 30 days). Here is the waitlist for early-bird updates.\nWhen it all clicked, I started seeing success. Throughout the last 4 years, I\u2019ve pieced together the puzzle. Here is what I wish I knew at 18 years old:\nThe Future Career Path\nThe Future Career Path\nThe future of work will not be work. It will be play.\nThe human psyche is wired for survival. Entrepreneurship is modern-day survival.\nThe people of the past would hunt, gather, trade, and earn within their own little community.\n\nThe internet gives us the opportunity to hunt, gather, trade, and earn within our own infinite community.\n\nReturn to nature.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) May 5, 2022\nWe cannot control human evolution. The path is already laid out and it is unfolding rapidly before our eyes. Those that hop on the train will survive and others will experience neurobiological decay.\nGood dopamine VS bad. Pursuing your curiosity, making discoveries, and being able to maintain that lifestyle in a world that is shifting from corporation to individual. Tapping into your creative genius, creating solutions to problems, condensing information, and raising the well-being of the collective.\nPursuing Your Curiosity\nSpecific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018\nWe\u2019ve talked about curiosity a lot in these letters, specifically in the last one.\nFor the first 18+ years of our lives, culture is designed to strip our child-like curiosity away from us. This is a blessing and a curse. A blessing for those that realize it, a curse for those that don\u2019t.\nCuriosity is the path to doing the things you want to do \u2014 not the things that others want you to do. The school system assigns us learning material that we may or may not be interested in. It may spark curiosity to explore something in your own time, but kids rarely do that. Especially when their parents are yelling at them to do their homework.\nYou pursue your curiosity by questioning instead of coping.\n\u201cWhat if I learned that skill?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I improved my health?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I started that business?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I failed? What if I didn\u2019t? What if I stuck it out? Would the world end? Of course not.\u201d\nAfter a series of questions, what follows is exploration of the unknown. Action. Finding resources to self-educate online. Letting new discoveries lead you down another unknown path. Repeating the process until you\u2019ve connected all of the dots.\nLuckily, we live in a world where anything is monetizable. If you know how to learn fast, build an offer, and sell \u2014 you can build distribution just by talking, learning, and teaching about your curiosities online.\nThe Medium & The Message\nI have a theory. A theory that we as humans are mapping out the collective consciousness online.\nCreators, personal brands, \u201cthought leaders,\u201d and online educators are increasing the rate of evolution at an exponential rate. We are condensing information through courses, systems, step-by-step guides, and mentorship that distills years of experience in a digestible way. What would have taken 60 million bits of information to process now takes 10 million.\nWe can learn more, act faster, make new discoveries, and pass down our own lessons in the same manner. Some argue this is the meaning of life and some people are sitting on the sidelines as others are building massive leverage for their future. All while pursuing their unique curiosities that would allow everyone to go in a unique, unsaturated direction in business.\nThat is exactly what humans do. They imitate for survival. We imitated our parents, teachers, and friends in order to learn how to function in the world. Many stop there. Intelligent imitation comes after the fact. You learn from those that are condensing information you are curious about, dissect it, understand it, and experience it. How? By documenting what you learn, build, and experience online. To do this correctly, you need an understanding of what captures attention. That is, how to distill your learnings in a way that attracts others pursuing their curiosity.\nIf you want my Intelligent Imitation process for faster learning, download my free 7-day challenge. It will 10x your creative output and make content creation ideas seamless. (It\u2019s how I write these newsletters).\nNow, back on track. There are 2 paths you can take to pursue your intrinsic curiosity.\n1) Media (The Message)\nMedia is how we communicate with other human beings without being right in front of them. The front end of the internet is media. That is how you capture attention to educate, entertain, and inspire others. That is how you attract an audience, learn in public, and distribute your condensed zip-file-like knowledge that you can sell (while simultaneously accelerating evolution and raising the collective well-being).\nTo master media, study marketing, persuasion, sales, psychology, epistemology, philosophy, and everything else that allows you to understand the mind. The best way to do this is to learn in public. That is, learn by building out a real-world project. Start a social media account based on your curiosities. Create videos, podcasts, articles, posts, and the rest. Treat it like a hobby, a game where you are learning what makes other human beings tick.\nAt a minimum, you have created a public portfolio and developed modern skills that can get you a high-paying job without a degree. Media jobs are hot. You can work for marketing and media agencies, creatives, other personal brands, and many other options. You can then use your increase in income to fuel your entrepreneurial journey (and have already mastered the media game).\nAt a maximum, you build leverage for your future, create a system-based project, and make more than enough money than you need to live a happy life.\nEither way, you win. Start creating.\nModern Mastery HQ \u2014 the private community \u2014 has 1000+ members doing just that. Koe Letter readers can join for $5.\n2) Code (The Medium)\nThe tech world has exploded in the last decade. Tech, specifically code, is the vessel for media. It allows us to package up information in a structured way. It allows us to house the information, products, services, and everything else in the digital economy. It is the back-end of the internet.\nAgain, you can learn to code and get a job in ~6 months without a degree, make a good amount of money, and then transition into whatever you would like. When I was in my last year of college before dropping out, code was my curiosity. I took a basic HTML and CSS class, got hooked, and started self-educating via YouTube videos and courses. I ended up getting a job at a web design agency after failing on the media side of things. I used that income to fuel my business and ended up seeing success freelancing. I took what I learned, talked about it online, packaged up a system, and sold it under my personal brand.\nThere is more to the coding side of things, like blockchain and web3, but I can\u2019t let my focus split from what I\u2019m building just yet. So I\u2019ll leave that to your curiosity \ud83d\ude42\n3) The Brutal Combo\nThe beautiful thing about all of this:\nThe coders of the world have gotten so good that no-code tools are popping up out of nowhere. Anyone can build a website, email list, blog, product, membership, community, and other things that allow them to harness their media skills online.\nWith these no-code tools, the average individual will learn both media and code by just starting a personal brand. You educate yourself on communication by learning and posting, you educate yourself on code by housing that information on your website, landing page, and email list.\nBuild Distribution, Then Build Whatever You Want\nBuild distribution, then build whatever you want.\n\u2014 jckbtchr (@jackbutcher) May 22, 2021\nAs we\u2019ve learned, anyone can build distribution. Distribution is just a fancy way of saying potential traffic. An audience is traffic. An email list is traffic. Communities are traffic. Your network is traffic. All can be sent to your digital product or service.\nThe world is craving human connection as we learn to navigate the internet. Decentralization is a hot topic. Corporations can\u2019t be trusted. Formal education can\u2019t be trusted. Individual distribution centers (personal brands) are popping up to give that human connection and educate. Everyone can pursue their curiosity and do what they love \u2014 if they realize this opportunity.\n\u201cThere are almost 7B people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7B companies.\u201d \u2014 Naval\nMedia is the information (content). Code is the real estate (where content is housed). Brand is distribution (how you attract people to your content). By building these digital assets, you can create a system-based digital product or service (that condenses information, which is valuable) and talk about your expertise from the lens of your curiosities (so there is no \u201ccompetition\u201d).\nMaking A Fortune\nSo far, we\u2019ve gone through the curiosity, media, code, and distribution steps. But what do you distribute? Digital products or services. The things that impact human\u2019s direct experience through accelerated education or solving a problem.\nThere are 3 ways to do this:\n1) Done For You\nDone for you services are things like freelancing or agency work. Someone has a problem, you have a unique system for solving that, they hire you, and you solve the problem for them.\n2) Done With You\nDone with you services are things like consulting, coaching, or mentoring. Rather than doing something for someone, you are walking them through your system. You are teaching them, educating them, on how to improve a certain aspect of their life. You help them navigate the roadblocks that you\u2019ve experienced previously.\n3) Do It Yourself\nDo it yourself is for digital products. You package up your system in a digestible way via no-code tools and distribute it infinitely via the internet. You can go straight into the digital product game, but you will need distribution to monetize well. When you don\u2019t have distribution, freelancing or consulting can help you develop your system, get results, and make an income without a large audience.\nThis is how you make a fortune. By working your way up the ladder, developing your system, packaging it up, and distributing it with \u201cno marginal cost of replication.\u201d\nFortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).\n\u2014 Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018\nStart Building Leverage\nI could go on and on about this, and I will in future letters, but for now \u2014 just start. That is how you learn. Use my Power Planner to develop the mission and vision for your brand (what you are leading people towards, what you are going to study, and what you are going to learn in public). Then, use my intelligent imitation process to aid in the process of documenting your mind.\nThat is what we are all doing. Mapping out a giant mind (like the universe is) online. Join the party and reap the neurobiological benefits, or wait until you have no other option. I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cfear-mongering,\u201d but there truly seems to be no other path. You either live in accordance with nature or be a product of man. That is, create or be created.\nIf you want The Koe Letter sent to your inbox every Saturday morning, you can subscribe here."

        "content": "It has always felt that my life unfolded in phases. In one phase, I felt lost. In another, pinned to my desk. Surging with energy. Deep in the flow state. Building out my future. In another phase, I was going through the motions, but with enjoyment.\nThe silly thing is that I had never felt this way while in high school or college. When teachers and employers directed my attention. The cyclical nature of sovereign living only came into play when I had to manage my goals. When I had to master my attention in relation to where I wanted to go in life.\nThe phases of being lost were the most destructive, yet most enlightening. Fumbling around in the dark, hoping to find a candle. Finding one. Watching it die out. Finding another and hoping it guides you to the next one before the darkness collapses once again.\nThrough awareness and the intention to improve, these cycles have become less destructive.\nI could only imagine how some others must feel. Not knowing how to leverage those periods of feeling lost \u2014 when, in fact, you are only preparing for the next round of heat.\nLike a sauna. Don\u2019t fight it. Let it purify you.\nThe 3 Drivers Of Progress\nThe 3 Drivers Of Progress\nWhen you commit to building a life according to your goals \u2014 as opposed to someone else\u2019s \u2014 there are 3 drivers of progress. Meaning if you are engaged \u2014 or conscious \u2014 of these phases, you are making progress toward a better life.\nThese phases occur for everyone but are the most devastating for those that aren\u2019t doing what they enjoy. For those that followed someone else\u2019s path instead of blazing their own. Conditioned for a repetitive future since childhood.\nUnderstanding these phases will help you identify where you are at in your journey, what you can do about it, and how to make accurate decisions.\nThe 3 drivers of progress are:\nIntensity\nConsistency\nCuriosity\nThese come in cycles. Phases. One leads to another. They are inevitable cycles of life. Ebb and flow. Wu wei. Push pull. The secret is to let go. Let these cycles happen as they will. Flow with the river. Fighting it will only keep you trapped in that phase of life until you learn the lesson it is trying to teach you.\nIntensity is for building. Consistency is for maintaining. Curiosity is for exploring.\nThese are not only life cycles, but year, month, week, and day cycles. We will be diving into the macro perspective in this post. While we are at it, can you start to become aware of these cycles in your day-to-day life?\nHere\u2019s how you navigate them:\nExploring The Unknown\n\u201cWhen you walk to the edge of all the light you have and take that first step into the darkness of the unknown, you must believe that one of two things will happen. There will be something solid for you to stand upon or you will be taught to fly.\u201d \u2013 Patrick Overton\nWe will start with the curiosity phase as many people misperceive it. This is the phase that people get trapped in for life. Infinite room for improvement, but keeping a 50-foot distance from the edge of their comfort zone.\nLife is a series of experiments. Nobody \u2014 not a single soul \u2014 has or ever will have it all figured out. The unknown is a land of infinite opportunity. Yet most people perceive it as a land of immense risk.\nSide note: risk, as with everything else, is a label. A fabricated concept that implies a reward. The 1% of top performers perceive risk for what it is, a part of life. The 99% of under-performers perceive risk for what it does, destroys their bubble of familiarity. Scary.\nThe curiosity phase is tricky. It doesn\u2019t seem like exploration. It seems like you are floating in space. No routine to ground yourself in. No sense of direction in life. Halfway between \u201cI want to do this for the rest of my life!\u201d and \u201cWho would do this for the rest of their life?\u201d\nWe must adopt the mindset of an explorer. Slashing through the jungle in search for a new life-changing discovery. Exploring the unknown is the real-world manifestation of \u201cthrowing sh*t at a wall and seeing what sticks.\u201d\nIt takes intuition, surrender, and acceptance to navigate this phase with ease \u2014 but there are ways to navigate it more effectively. Try this:\nWrite out 20 interests you have\nMake a note of related interests (intersections)\nImmerse yourself in information related to those\nRead books, listen to podcasts, follow leaders in that space\nConnect the dots and understand the real world utility\nTeach what you have learned to understand it better\nBy the end of it all, you gain a deeper understanding of the direction you must move in. Your neurobiology \u2014 the feeling of excitement \u2014 will hint at passion. Educate yourself along your journey in the unknown. Education shines the light of awareness on the map of the unknown. Invest your time in free content. Invest your money in the teachings of those you aspire to be like (courses or coaching).\nThe curiosity phase is for exploration, experimentation, and making new discoveries. Those new discoveries lead you down a path that you want to go down \u2014 not the one someone else wants you to go down. This requires you to be in touch with your intuition \u2014 your neurobiology \u2014 and let curiosity be your intrinsic driver. It is a time for testing new interests, gauging their utility, and eventually connecting the dots. This leads to immense clarity that launches you into the next phase.\nBuilding A Better Future \u2014 Fast\nThe intensity phase is for building a project related to your curiosities. When the clarity hits \u2014 mornings, nights, and days are a blur of trying to find the time to get things done as fast as possible. Nothing will stop you from blazing your trail. Focus is seamless. Flow seems to last all day. You don\u2019t even need your precious to-do app to keep you on track.\nThis phase comes after the curiosity phase. It occurs when everything clicks. You make the new discovery, have a burst of clarity, and develop a strategy that will launch you to new heights. You can already feel yourself in your future shoes. Who you are and who you want to become merge into one. You are that person. You are just waiting for time to catch up.\nIntensity clarifies. It creates not only momentum, but also the pressure you need to feel either friction, or fulfillment. \u2014 Marcus Buckingham\nThe building phase is for turning curiosity into obsession. It is for brewing the neurochemical cocktail that launches you into the flow state. It is for cultivating passion and purpose while building towards autonomy and mastery. This is where you build out your future. Personal freedom. Self-actualization. This phase is best used on a project with high potential profitability. It can start as a hobby \u2014 and can remain a hobby \u2014 but autonomy is necessary if you want to continue down this path.\nTowards the end of this phase, you must systemize if you want to maintain your progress.\nConsistency Compounds\nAt the end of the intensity phase, you reach a new baseline. Mental, physical, spiritual, financial, whatever it may be. If you don\u2019t maintain this baseline, you will hit a new low. Again, this is a cycle. You don\u2019t have to fall back into a curiosity phase just to feel lost again.\nConsistency is best navigated with systems. These systems should revolve around the fundamentals. The lever-moving actions that result in growth. Bake these fundamentals into your routines, automate them if you can, and delegate what you hate doing.\nAgain, take out pen and paper, or download my planner:\nNote your lever-moving goal-oriented tasks\nSchedule time blocks for executing on those\nAvoid distractions and get into a deep work routine\nDo this when your energy is highest\nReflect often and delegate what you don\u2019t like to tech or VAs\nBy building out proper life and business systems, you can maintain a full-time income with 2-4 hours of focused work. No-code tech advancements have reduced the workload of solopreneurs. Digital product and service creators have a luxury that many can\u2019t fathom. You can only decrease your work times by automating or delegating tasks. Employees are the ones that get delegated tasks.\nOnce you feel stable, you can maintain your progress and take the plunge into another curiosity phase. Explore the unknown, self-educate to find your way, and let new discoveries launch you into a cycle of intensity. (Bonus points if you build on top of what you\u2019ve already built \u2014 that\u2019s leverage.)\nMacro & Micro Phases\nOnce you have consciously experienced these phases, they become more predictable. You can navigate them more efficiently. You can predict what is going to happen and ease your worries about the future.\nThe thing is, these phases do not only exist in the macro. They exist in the micro. You can use your understanding of these phases to craft a sustainable routine. For example, I:\nBuild for the first 2 hours of the morning (intensity)\nMaintain for 2 hours after that (consistency)\nExplore in my afternoons (curiosity)\nThis is baked into my schedule. A well designed lifestyle. Micro phases within macro phases. It is a balance of segmenting your time and knowing when to pivot.\nBut we can talk about that at another time. We will dive deep into lifestyle design in a later post.\nIf you want weekly updates on my articles and my top 3 life & business tips of the week, subscribe to The Koe Letter."

They set the tone for the rest of the day. Your morning routine should have the purpose of generating energy.\nWe want to carry and maintain that energy throughout the day.\nGo On A Walk\nWe all know that the body follows the mind, but the mind can also follow the body.\nThey play into each other.\nIf you want to generate unstoppable momentum into the rest of your day, start by moving your body.\nBetter yet, do it outside.\n\u201cAn early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.\u201d \u2013 Henry David Thoreau.\nHenry was onto something.\nNot only are you getting some of your daily steps in, but you are also exposing your skin to direct sunlight.\nThis is critical for healthy circadian biology when you do it on a consistent basis.\n(It will even help you get on a more consistent sleep schedule \u2014 maybe you aren\u2019t a night owl after all!)\nYou can walk to a coffee shop, around your apartment complex, or wherever else you please.\nWrite this down in your planner the night before so it is top of mind in the morning.\nThe 10 Minute Creative\nLet\u2019s make the snowball of momentum even bigger. Let\u2019s make it impossible for the day to be considered a loss.\nMy favorite morning habit is one that I\u2019ve been developing over the years.\nIt is a combination of journaling, note-taking, and writing.\nIt helps you learn faster, train your creative muscle, and have immense mental clarity.\n(And if you are a creator, it helps you have unlimited ideas for your work.)\nHere\u2019s what you do.\nStep 1) Get Inspired\nRead an article, blink, favorite quote, or page from a book.\nYou can also listen to an audiobook during your morning walk!\nNote: these should align with your interests.\nThis will give you inspiration for the rest of your day.\nStep 2) Take Note Of Your Excitement\nDopamine separates signal from noise.\nAs you are reading or listening, write down what catches your attention and makes you a bit excited.\nI have a running notes app in my phone that I write all of these down in.\nStep 3) Write A 3-5 Bullet Summary\nWhat should you include in this summary?\nA description of how YOU understand the topic.\nPersonal experiences and stories\nOther ideas that come to mind\nBonus Step For Creators\nWrite out a common problem related to the topic\nWrite out the benefits of solving that problem\nWrite out steps to overcoming it\nNow you have an outline for a blog, thread, newsletter, or multiple tweets.\n(That\u2019s how I wrote this article.)\nStep 4) One-Sentence Big Idea\nThis is where the creativity comes into play.\nFrom everything you\u2019ve written before, write a one-sentence summary.\nGet creative. Try to write it with the quality of your favorite quote.\nWhy are we doing this?\nIt gets the creative juices flowing\nIt primes your brain for pattern recognition\nIt shows you that you CAN be original & profound\nThis will only compound as you write more big ideas.\nIf you want a guided 7-day challenge for the 10-Minute Creative habit, here it is.\nThe Power Hour\nSo far we\u2019ve spent about 20 productive minutes of our morning.\nOur body and mind are ready to keep going. To take on a challenge. To get into flow.\nNext up is what I like to call the Power Hour (no, not the drinking game).\n\u201cHappiness is the feeling that power increases \u2013 that resistance is being overcome.\u201d\n\u2014 Nietzsche\nThe Power Hour is a 1-hour timeblock that is dedicated to builiding.\nNo distractions. One priority. Laser focused.\nThink of it as an automated 1% better everyday.\nWhat are you building?\nPersonal freedom.\nWork on your side business\nWrite an article, thread, or book\nCreate social media posts\nLearn a marketable skill\nReach out to potential clients\nYou know, the things you said you would start doing but haven\u2019t\u2026\nHow do I know what to work on?\nWrite out your vision for the future\nReverse engineer it into a 10-year goal\nThen a 1-year goal\nThen monthly goals\nNow align your Power Hour tasks with that monthly goal.\nLever-moving fundamental-focused action that results in an automated 1% better everyday. This is why I created The Power Planner.\nYou will end your Power Hour feeling positive about the future.\nWithin 1 hour you have won the day before most people have woken up.\nThat feeling is unbeatable.\nTo recap:\nGo on a walk for movement and direct sunlight.\nSpend 10-minutes training your creativity muscle.\nSpend 1-hour building a better future for yourself.\nWhen done consistently, you will look back after 6 months and bask in the progress you made."

        "heading": "Why Choosing A Niche Is Stupid (For Intelligent People)",
        "content": "Human beings can process 126 bits of information per second (per my research, Google says different, oh well). That adds up to 185 billion bits of information throughout our entire lives (on average). These bits of information are stored somewhere in our brain. Through consciousness, we order this information. That is, what we are conscious of gets stored. We are conscious of what we bring our attention to. What we focus on. There is more to this, but the point is that we are limited in the amount of information we can be conscious of throughout our lifetimes.\nI would consider this a crucial player in human potential \u2014 if not the main metric for human potential. While most give 15% of their conscious attention to showering, bathing, grooming, cooking, and other necessities \u2014 most also lay around, watch TV, scroll memes, and numb their mind with useless activities. Throwing their potential down the drain.\nLast week we discussed Ken Wilber\u2019s holonic theory. How we are beings that must develop ourselves in specific areas and pass through the 3 developmental stages \u2014 having our skill in that area become art. Ken has mentioned this, but the statistic above solidifies it. Human beings can process 185 billion bits of information through conscious development. This limits the amount of areas we can truly develop ourselves in. This also means that others are limited in the same manner. Everyone will develop themselves in different domains of life \u2014 per many philosophers and ancient teachers, this is what brings happiness. The act of not doing so brings unhappiness.\nThat is, having a vision, goal, and consciously working to actualize those things is what works \u2014 \u201cfind joy in the process.\u201d\nFrom Nietszche:\n\u201cHappiness is the feeling that power increases \u2014 that resistance is being overcome.\u201d\nFrom Csikszentmihalyi:\n\u201cThe mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life.\u201d\nIf we think of this in the context of a game \u2014 like World Of Warcraft \u2014 you tap out at a max level. There is only so much experience you can gain. There is only so many \u201cpoints\u201d you can give in a specific trait on the skill tree. If you do not play the story or participate in various parts of the game, you will not max out your level (or potential). If you spread your points too thin, you will end up having little power compared to others that distributed their points wisely.\nMindset, focus, ordering your mind, avoiding distractions, and other sayings that imply using your limited consciousness to develop awareness and pursue a hierarchy of interest-based goals is one of the master keys to overall life enjoyment.\nThis is a lesson in itself that I will talk about in a future letter. You will never have access to another person\u2019s state of mind. You will never understand how they have controlled their consciousness. You will never understand the hierarchy of goals they are pursuing that brings them happiness. Just because somebody doesn\u2019t lift, start a business, improve their health, and all of the stuff I talk about \u2014 does not mean they are not thoroughly happy. One that follows their dopamine-induced rabbit hole explorations in vegan eating may be happier than me due to their ordered consciousness. Judgement is useless. Assumptions are useless. Expectations are useless. Do what\u2019s best for you and let others do what\u2019s best for them. Only teach when others want to be reached. \u201cThe lips of wisdom are closed except to the ears of understanding.\u201d\nIf we want to take it further, The 3 Pillars in my future book are focus, energy, and experience. Focus, in my eyes, is conscious attention. Energy, whether you believe it or not, is held in everything around you. Positive or negative. What you focus on breathes life / energizes whatever it is you are \u201cpaying\u201d attention to. This energy is reflected in you, dictating your experience. Experience, per Csikszentmihalyi, is stored information based on what you were conscious of. This experience will form the foundation of everything going forward.\nI\u2019m rambling\u2026.\nHow The \u201cCreator\u201d Economy Is Accelerating Our Development\nI was having a talk with JK Molina the other night and we were discussing the need for creativity in the development of business. Think of it like this\u2026 through specific knowledge \u2014 that is, courses, coaching, apprenticeships, and other forms of online education \u2014 people are packaging up and simplifying ~10 years of information, experience, and failures into a simple and actionable roadmap for success in a specific domain of life. Books, articles, videos, podcasts, etc. Consume them, but have a project to tie ideas back to and invoke pattern recognition.\nYou could say that this information has been condensed or compacted. A zip file if you will. Our brains can now process what used to be 10 years of information much faster. Instead of this information taking up ~5 billion bits of our conscious attention, it takes up ~10 million bits. Meaning that we are \u201ccreating\u201d solutions to problems, busting through the limits of individuals\u2019 personal and professional development, and opening up room for them to do the same.\nIt took me 5 years to see success with freelancing. After I packaged up everything in my first eBook and sold it \u2014 others saw success within months. Now they can see MORE success in less time, package up their learnings over 1-3 years, and pass down their teachings. Leading to exponential development in particular domains. Also allowing for quick development in multiple domains. Computer programming used to be extremely specialized. Now their are frameworks, education, and ways of learning that can get you a high-paying web dev job in 6 months without a degree. This will only continue to accelerate \u2014 especially for those in tech and those that dare to pursue creative work.\nMy point is, we are compressing the amount of information that needs to be processed. We can learn more than those before us thanks to creators and tech. We do not have to specialize in a specific area. In fact, we are drastically limiting ourselves by specializing in one thing. One becomes valuable through specialization, and irreplaceable by becoming a modern renaissance man. By enhancing their specialization and opening up room for creativity by learning complimentary areas. A solopreneur can thrive because they can learn marketing, sales, a marketable skill, email marketing, create content, edit videos, run ads, build products, generate leads, etc. By compressing, systemizing, and productizing this process throughout your lifetime as a creator \u2014 you can make $1-$5MM as a one-person operation. A small team adds more firepower, of course.\nDo you see the power and necessity of becoming a creator? You are quite literally \u201craising the collective human consciousness\u201d while doing what you love. By creating novel solutions that rapidly increase the domain-specific development of individuals. While at the same time increasing your own development even moreso due to teachers learning more than students. You open up room for further innovation if you are consistently producing / creating content, products, services, and simplified ways of understanding.\nSide note: I am honestly surprised of how much of a creative \u201cfusion\u201d this newsletter is. I would not have been able to make these connections without being a creator, and that is exactly my point. You have to go through the developmental stages, utilize the specific knowledge available (self-education), and become a creator to further enhance, connect, and simplify that knowledge through value production.\nSpecialization Is A False God\nRemember from last week how we discussed the pre-trans fallacy? The developmental stages of going from pre-rational, rational, and trans-rational? In essence, how this meme is true for every aspect of life?\nNiche IQ Bell Curve\nThe \u201cjack of all trades\u201d or Renaissance Man used to bring one success in older times. Then came the age of specialization. Now, for those that see the opportunity and seize it, the renaissance times are coming back \u2014 mainly in the online world.\nLet me ask you a question. What is my niche? What is my specialization? Can you give me a straight answer? If you told me \u201conline business\u201d or \u201cself-improvement\u201d or \u201cphilosophy and spirituality\u201d or even \u201cfitness and health\u201d I would not agree. My brand is a synthesis \u2014 an interconnectedness \u2014 of the areas I have chosen to develop myself in. My niche is \u201call of the above\u201d which is the precursor for creativity. Not limiting myself allows me to connect with those that are developing themselves in similar areas. Not limiting myself opens up room for pattern recognition, allowing me to connect the dots and bring knew, novel perspectives on any given topic. It allows myself and my products to separate themselves from the sea of commodities.\nNow, specialization is important at the start and can serve very useful long term. This is the difference between becoming valuable and becoming irreplaceable. Jack of all trades master of none VS jack of all trades master of ONE. Specializing in one area while taking advantage of modern innovations that allow you to develop yourself quickly in multiple domains gives you leverage. Your development in sub-domains will only aid in your effectiveness in the development of your main domain.\nThe Experience Model For Modern Business\nThe world is shifting. As technology advances, we are slowly becoming more human (if you use it wisely). It is opening up room for more creative pursuits and the ability to earn a massive income doing so.\nIn comes my notion of The Experience Model to thrive in the creator / attention economy.\nThe amount of information you process throughout your life determines your conditioning, programming, beliefs, biases, perceptions, identity, personality, skill level, and the rest. Where and how your attention is placed (or manipulated) determines your experience. Your experience is what will serve as the foundation of your creations. That is your content, products, and services. Your potential will become your brand. That is your vision, goals, and values. Nobody can replicate this \u201cniche\u201d and you are not limited to the products you create. They will be profitable as long as you understand the Evergreen Skills.\nDo you see everything coming full circle? Personal growth = business growth.\nOne thing to think about in terms of content creation: can you capture peoples attention through novelty, make them aware of a specific interest they want to pursue, fill their limited consciousness with compact and valuable information, leading them towards a better life? Above all, that is the key to a personal brand or creator.\nYou craft your own vision, goals, and values \u2014 work towards them, and attract followers that you lead toward this better life. Your vision is the desire outcome for you and your followers. Your goals are what you are working towards. Your values are the areas that you & your followers are developing themselves in. All of these form your content pillars. When it comes time to create content, you bank on your experience. The lessons you have learned that consistently get more creative as you develop yourself in these areas. You teach from your mistakes, insights, and successes as you blaze the path towards actualizing your vision. It is a highly fulfilling line of work. People follow you because you are the confident and authentic leader towards a better life.\nIn comes creativity. How do we incorporate it into our life and business for maximum, rapid advancement? By building off of the ideas and specific knowledge that are already created. You bring clarity to your vision when you follow and emulate other leaders or aspirational archetypes. Like that saying, \u201cevery good coach has a coach.\u201d\nAs a side note and reminder, this is more of a philosophical take \u2014 if you want my simple and straightforward business, social media, and performance systems to build a multi-six figure business as a creator, join MMHQ here.\nHow To Live (And Earn) In Accordance With Nature\nThe first step is awareness. Awareness of your conditioning and programming. Given time, you heart and mind open. You revert to your child-like state\u2026 or should I say you transcend your adult-like state (pre-trans fallacy) and unlock the gifts of confidence, curiosity, and creativity.\nThrough curiosity, you pursue the areas of development that truly interest you. You build momentum through pattern recognition and dopamine. You begin making connections from different domains \u2014 and unless you transcend to creator (child = creator, adult = consumer, childlike adult = creator) you cannot fully develop yourselves in those areas. You are not teaching, leading, and doing the things necessary to reach the next stage of development.\nBy pursuing YOUR interests in accordance with nature (your intuition), you become a \u201cniche of one.\u201d You build out your \u201cpersonal monopoly\u201d of a brand. You live in accordance with the evolution (nature) of the internet. You flow (and profit) with the overall development of the universe. This is what you are supposed to do. You haven\u2019t realized it because you are out of touch with your being \u2014 and you do not have an anchor of becoming.\nHow you choose to fill the 185 billion bits of information is going to be vastly different from others. Sure, some similarities will be shared, but competition is irrelevant at this point. Your \u201cniche\u201d is the manifestation of the billions of bits of information that you have stored throughout your life. In short, you have more to share than you think \u2014 all you need is a hierarchy of goals pertaining to growing online, educating yourself on branding, marketing, and sales, and maintaining momentum.\nIt\u2019s easier than you think. The only thing standing in the way of your progress is yourself. Your unconscious identification with the mind. You already have everything within you \u2014 all you need to do is embrace your innate curiosity, let it be your guide, pass down your experiences, and document the journey via content, products, and services.\nOf course, there are more technical details, but I\u2019ve produced hundreds of newsletters, MMHQ articles, podcasts, courses, videos, trainings, and posts about those already. Everything you need is already out there on the internet. You may be blind to them because you allow distractions to capture and hold your attention.\nWake Up.\nDan Koe"

Hot Pockets.\nYou know, the things that aren\u2019t that bad if you make the conscious one-time choice\u2026 but if unconscious can lead to 30 years of mediocrity passing in the blink of an eye.\nJimmy was offered a helping hand.\nThe universe gave him a chance.\nA feeling. A call to adventure. A higher version of himself begging\u2026 SCREAMING to be let out.\nHe didn\u2019t even notice it.\nJimmy picked up the remote, clicked \u201cSkip Intro,\u201d took a bong rip, and woke up in a blur just to put on his work clothes.\nAll Is Mind\nJimmy is a concept, created by you while reading this.\nWhen you stop, Jimmy ceases to exist.\nYour attention is the barrier between Jimmy and the void.\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d says Jimmy.\nPoof \u2014 gone.\nYou may have heard spiritual gurus and philosophers mention that the universe is a giant mind.\nHow can that be?\nWell, the mind makes sense of the world through concepts, stories, metaphors, and symbols.\nTo understand those concepts, we need to understand the network of concepts that make it a concept.\nWhy is your hand a hand? Is it still a hand without an arm? What about a cup? Is that cup meaningless without a hand to pick it up?\nAnd gravity? What the fuck is gravity? Can you understand gravity without understanding force, gravitational constant, the mass of the object, and the distance between the centers of the masses? How do you determine the mass of an object? Can there be a \u201ccenter\u201d of a mass without there being an inner and outer?\nEverything you know is just a layer of stories pieced together for your understanding.\nIf this email was written in Chinese, would it mean anything to you? No.\nThe mind makes sense and gives meaning to life through stories.\n\u201cCool Dan, got it. Very insightful yada yada bing ding word word concept story\u201d\nSTORIES GIVE MEANING TO LIFE.\nYour identity is the story you tell yourself. You will live out that story on autopilot if not made conscious. If not made conscious, it is impossible for it to end in your favor.\nAre you the hero or the villain?\nOne cannot exist without the other.\nThe concept \u201chero\u201d does not make sense without the concept \u201cvillain.\u201d\nThese opposing concepts reflect the law of polarity. They create tension.\nThe concept of \u201clife\u201d does not make sense without \u201csuffering.\u201d\nNow, whether these are labeled as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d is up to you.\nRemember, it\u2019s all a story. A game. Something within your control. Something within your mind.\nLife implies suffering. Whether that suffering has a negative impact on you is determined by your level of consciousness and expectation.\nIf you expect life not to imply suffering, then you will suffer. Why? Because you are fighting against what is. You are trying to control the uncontrollable instead of flowing with it and controlling yourself within that flow.\nIf there is not a hero and villain of the story, it is boring. Meaningless. Unfulfilling. The story ceases to exist.\nYou are the actor. The player behind the character. The consciousness behind the mind.\nLife is a dance between the hero and the villain.\nPush pull. Wu wei. Yin yang.\nThe battle between good and evil is what propels you in any direction in life. If you are conscious of the battle, you move in a positive direction. If you are unconscious or resist the battle, you move in a negative direction.\nThe hero comes from humble beginnings. The hero levels up by playing the game. He fails\u2026 many times, but he doesn\u2019t quit.\nHe get\u2019s stronger. Cultivates a high value skill set. Rigs the game in his favor by taking full responsibility for the direction of his life.\nAfter a few bouts with the villain, he prevails. His name is remembered. The impact he left on other\u2019s is celebrated for centuries. His legacy is clear.\nCharacter Select\nAre you where you want to be in life?\nDo you have the money, body, energy, and relationships that you want?\nAre you pissed off yet?\nAre you the main character in your story?

The story you want to live out. Do not limit yourself.\nCraft your vision.\nWrite down your goals.\nWrite down your priorities.\nUse the Power Planner if you don\u2019t already have it (free).\nGain clarity on the blatantly obvious actions that you need to be taking on a daily basis.\nIt is fucking simple.\nLearn and apply.\nGo to the fucking gym. Fix your child-like diet. Start the business you\u2019ve been telling yourself you would start.\nDon\u2019t know how to? LEARN.\nWatch a YouTube video, buy a course, ask a friend.

Anger and \u201cevil\u201d are only a problem when you don\u2019t see them for what they are.\nWhen you aren\u2019t CONSCIOUS. When you are asleep.

        "heading": "How To Not End Up Mediocre",
        "content": "For the entirety of my life, I have been interested in dissecting what made successful people successful. With that, I have spent a lot of my time observing the mediocre, as it is necessary to understand what not to do before one can understand what to do.\nThrough my years of study, observation, and creating with the intention of piecing the puzzle together \u2014 I have an argument to share with you. This argument has been formed by my studies in spirituality, philosophy, business, health, performance, mindset, and many other domains. As much as I want this to be one size fits all approach, it may not be. However, I do believe success to be intuitive. The problem is that people drown their intuition with modern distractions.\nThis argument will have flaws. I encourage you to question it, research it, and form your own view. My point with my writing is to understand. To drop a reference point. To brighten more areas on the map that I am crafting with all of my content. This map will have holes, but those holes will be patched throughout the years I continue with this letter.\nThis argument forms the base for my mission of Modern Mastery. To tap into your intuition, live by it, and take advantage of the modern tools at your disposal \u2014 rather than letting them destroy your life. Let us begin.\nLiving In Accordance With Nature\nPer some of my previous letters on mental minimalism and perception, I have discussed this topic before. Flowing with \u201cwhat is\u201d and living by nature. I was listening to Meditations by Marcus Aurelius on my walk the other day and noticed that he often says we must \u201clive in accordance with nature.\u201d To my former self, this wouldn\u2019t have made sense. Now, I have some more firepower to make sense of it for you.\nFor those that are not familiar with holism or holonic theory, I will give you a brief rundown. A \u201cholon\u201d \u2014 a term coined by Ken Wilber \u2014 is the building block of reality. It is both a whole and a part. An atom is a whole, but it is also a part of a molecule. A molecule is a whole, but it is also a part of a cell. These holons span in infinite directions across all planes of reality. All the way up, all the way down. Forming an intimate connection with other holons. You are a holon. The universe is a holon. A building is a holon. A grain of sand is a holon. Everything is a holon. Before we dive deeper, I would encourage you to pause and become awestruck by this. How far down does this go? How far up?\nPer the image below, this reflects on a macro level with patterns being noticed throughout major religions and philosophies. If you want to dive deeper into all of this, I recommend the book A Brief Explanation Of Everything by Ken Wilber to start.\nThe Great Chain Of Being\n\u201cHolons\u201d have 12 tenets associated with them. These tenets reflect their evolutionary behavior. For now, understand that we have emerged from nature to body to mind to spirit. Plants, animals, and humans that are now having spiritual experiences. Holons emerge and evolve while bringing everything prior along with it. At our root \u2014 our being \u2014 we are nature. Yet we have animalistic drives and characteristics. And now we are in the stage of mind. Battling with the ego, understanding it, and bringing it under our control while tapping into the spiritual \u201crealm.\u201d\nI know that this is either boring you or piquing your interest to explore more, so I will move on and let the explorers of the unknown do their thing. Before that, understand that nature is our root. Nature is not mediocre, bad, or evil. How can it be when those are perceptions created by mind?\nChildlike Wonder\nYou as a child were your closest to nature. You were confident, curious, creative, loving, playful, and authentic. You acted based on your intuition and childlike impulse. When cultural conditioning came into play and your mind began to develop, you started forming your beliefs, biases, opinions, etc. You started to cover up that childlike wonder that you had. Your mind started to take over, and you began to live off of conditioned impulse rather than with nature.\nThe point of this argument is to say that it is in your biology (nature) to love, create, play, and pierce the world with your authentic confidence. Especially if you want to reach new heights and \u201cemerge\u201d to the next stage of development (more on that in a bit).\n\u201cBut Dan, if we only acted from our intuition we may end up doing something stupid.\u201d\nWell yeah, that\u2019s kinda the point. Why does doing something stupid scare you if it was the direction you were meant to move in? Aside from that, this is why we have evolved to the stage of mind. It is a survival mechanism. A tool. You can frame your focus through vision, goals, and priorities to make conscious and positive decisions. When we strip away the negatives from cultural conditioning and get closer to nature \u2014 our intuition becomes more accurate. Curiosity becomes our guide. Self-education and self-reliance start to trump dependency. We live the life that we were supposed to.\nI want to bring up Ken Wilber\u2019s pre-trans model / fallacy. It reminds me of why I believe studying metaphysics, philosophy, and spirituality is better than reading endless books (however those are good for short-term strategy to make money.)\nHave you seen the IQ bell curve meme? That is modeled after Ken\u2019s pre-trans fallacy that reflects across all developmental domains of life. There\u2019s a reason why this meme always makes you think, \u201cdamn that\u2019s true.\u201d\nIQ Bell Curve Meme\nYou have to go through the stages of development (pre-rational, rational, and trans-rational) in many domains of life \u2014 and life as a whole. In terms of your skill set, you must go through the stages of development until that skill becomes art. Elite athletes often consider their top performances to be spiritual. Meaning they have developed themselves and their skill to a point where they have transcended the need to think about it.\nAnd that is the point. You HAVE to look like a simpleton. You HAVE to make mistakes and embarrass yourself. You have to reach the \u201cpeak of mount stupid\u201d and \u201cvalley of despair\u201d before you reach the \u201cslope of sustainability.\u201d As Joey Justice once said, \u201cone must be cringe before they can become based.\u201d Just to become cringe again. An enlightened version of cringe.\nDunning-Kruger Effect\nMany ancient teachers, spiritual gurus, and modern thought leaders have landed on a similar conclusion for your overarching life purpose. It is to \u201craise the collective human consciousness,\u201d \u201cpass down your experiences,\u201d and other variations of that. How do we do that? By getting in touch with nature, listening to it, letting all of it\u2019s positive qualities guide us towards our natural inclinations, and create accordingly.\nWhen you have stripped away the perceptions of the mind, brought order to it, and have a curious open mind, you allow destiny to play its part. You become conscious of the modern distractions that stand in your way and you let curiosity run the show. You learn, use, and experience accordingly. Increasing your awareness, understanding, and consciousness. The beautiful thing about this is that the Create-or economy is booming. Modern online business has become a place where people can share their unique and diverse (positive and natural) experiences to \u201craise the collective human consciousness\u201d at scale. To impact the world through loving, authentic, and creative endeavors that help others develop across all domains of life.\nFocus Framing\nThe mind craves understanding. It makes sense of things through order. Map making, story telling, concepts, labels, symbols and the rest. That\u2019s all your reality is. Layer after layer of stories and concepts based on the lens of perception that you view the world from \u2014 usually formed by culture and programming.\nThis is not a bad thing. It is a thing that you need be made conscious of. The mind loves order, so why not order it in a manner that aligns being and becoming? Nature and growth. Some call this mindset, but I like to think of it as \u201cfocus framing.\u201d Considering our attention is being manipulated and stolen from us through modern distractions, we have to channel our attention in a positive, natural direction through focus.\nAgain, this is why The Creation Hierarchy and/or consistent use and iteration inside The Power Planner is so important. Whether you know if your vision, routines, goals, priorities, and the rest are \u201cgood\u201d or not \u2014 simply writing them down will start to train your mind towards them. You will become more conscious of a better life. You can begin to iterate on your vision because these things act as reference points. Your curiosity will begin to show because you will notice the things that potentially align with your vision, goals, projects, etc. Then, all at once, as if it were a messenger from the divine, you will feel a \u201cpull\u201d to go all-in on something that YOU want to do. Not what you have been programmed to want to do.\nIf you don\u2019t want to end up mediocre, you need to order your mind \u2014 frame your focus \u2014 towards a future of excellence. You need to write down what you currently want. Observe what you don\u2019t want without judgement. With time, allow your vision to gain clarity.\nYou have to empty your mind of everything except for present moment observation, execution, and being (80%) paired with subtle reminders of your vision, goals, and priorities that spark excitement in you (20%). This battle creates tension. Tension creates story. Story creates meaning.\nStop Caring\nRecently I have been toying more and more with \u201cnot caring\u201d about anything. It\u2019s taken a lot of practice and development. I\u2019ve \u201cstopped caring\u201d about health and instead make conscious decisions that are aligned with who I want to become. I don\u2019t have to waste energy on thinking through decisions when they are already made. I\u2019ve \u201cstopped caring\u201d about business and build out projects according to my interest. If I hadn\u2019t gone through the overthinking \u201crational\u201d phase, I wouldn\u2019t have the depth, nuance, or information necessary to make those projects work with little effort.\nLife now has become more about doing exactly what I \u201cwant\u201d with a conscious mind just to unveil the path of what I really want \u2014 just to repeat the cycle over and over again. This tension creates meaning while I move in an infinitely positive direction in the domains I choose to develop myself in.\nWith all of this, I\u2019m still figuring it out. The main lesson that I\u2019ve pulled from all of my studies is that you should simply do what you want with a conscious mind.\nEnding the letter here.

        "heading": "The Simple 3 Point Online Business Model",
        "content": "In a world of over-complication, I am on a mission to simplify the complex. Business is one of the most simple things out there, but most of us never touched a business book during our childhood. We think that building a business is reserved for people with startup capital, a top 1% skillset, and/or a huge following + paid ads.\nLet\u2019s take a step back and see what you really need to hit the $5K, $10K, and even $50K per month mark.\nThe 3 point online business model is as follows:\nSocial media account\nEmail List\nOffer\nThey all interconnect, so stick to the end of the letter to understand the big picture of it all.\nPoint 1) Social Media Account\nYour social media account is your new resume.\nYour content displays your expertise, interests, and personality.\nAnd with paid ads becoming less viable, your social accounts are a free organic traffic source that you can send to your offers (what you are selling).\nMost people see social media growth as daunting. It is. But there are proven methods for growth and monetization. It would be silly to start growing an account if you have no idea what you are doing\u2026 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so daunting in the first place.\nSide note: you don\u2019t need a lot of followers to make 6 figures+. Yes, they help, A LOT, but you don\u2019t need them. You can grow to build leverage while pulling in a decent income.\nAll of this is like learning to play a game (because that\u2019s what it is). At first, a game is boring because you don\u2019t know how to play. But you play anyway, learn the rules, the fundamentals, how to win, and eventually it becomes fun. You want to play the game more because it starts to become an art as opposed to a science.\nThe same goes for social media. The rules are the platforms terms of service. The fundamentals are the growth mechanisms (how you get maximum exposure and convert those readers to followers). The mechanics reflect in your content. In the case of Twitter, the mechanics lie in your ability to write punchy content relevant to your interests.\nSince your social media account serves as the face of your brand, how do you get started?\nCreate A Content Pyramid\nYour content pyramid holds all of the topics that you want to talk about, usually branching down from 2-3 main pillars. Mine are self-improvement, online business, and a spiritual take on performance.\nYours can be anything. If somebody is talking about it online and has grown an audience, there is no reason you can\u2019t do the same. Another good metric: if you could talk to a friend for hours about a specific topic, why not talk to people online about it?\nThe Content Pyramid\nCraft A Followable Profile\nDon\u2019t overthink this step. Everybody else already is. Have a good looking profile photo, a compelling bio that answers the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d (the reader), and have a link that leads to your offers to show readers that you are a creator \u2014 not a consumer.\nA question to consistently ask yourself, does my account look like it should have 100,000 followers? No? Change something.\nUnderstand The Current Growth Meta\nAgain, this is a game. You need to understand what content results in the most growth for beginners because that is when it is the hardest to grow.\nThink about it, popular YouTubers did not post travel vlogs to get to where they are now. They played the game long enough to where they can now do whatever they want. At the beginning, they posted \u201chow-to\u201d videos and catered to the algorithm. Something that is popular right now are the \u201cI Tried X For 30 Days.\u201d\nOn Twitter, the current meta is punchy Tweets and Medium blog-style threads. Join communities, groups, and other places online that discuss what type of content is doing best, or just pay attention to what accounts are doing to grow.\nConsistency\nAt the end of the day, you don\u2019t have to pay attention to any of this. You SHOULD, but if you simply stuck it out and corrected your mistakes for a year, you\u2019d have a 5 figure following.\nYour social media account will be your way of selling your offers, making million dollar connections, and building leverage for the future of your brand. If you start a service business, build cashflow, and have a large audience \u2014 you can now start ANY business you want relating to your interests and make it a success. I plan on starting a coffee brand soon just because I f*cking love coffee.\nIf you want my legacy Twitter growth course, a step-by-step social media growth roadmap, and 154+ other online business strategies, check out the private community (MMHQ) here.\nEmail List\nThe unfortunate truth is that you do not own your social media account. It also may not be the best place to sell ALL THE TIME. With that said, you should start building your email list from the start. You don\u2019t NEED to email people or have a set schedule, but it would be silly not to start gathering emails. It will come in handy just in case you get canceled. You own your list.\nOnce you have the time, start writing a weekly newsletter. These newsletters can be turned into sequences, threads, blog posts, or YouTube videos down the road when you are ready to go down that avenue. For now, focus on developing your ideas and testing what resonates with your audience.\nWhen you have your offer (product or service ready) you can create email sequences to sell them on autopilot. Then, all you have to do is post content to your social account, plug your newsletter, and make sales without doing any of the work.\nStart with a welcome sequence. Have a welcome email that tells everyone what you talk about, your vision for your brand, and what they can expect in future emails. Then, have 2-3 emails that go over your story or the big problem you are aiming to solve. After that, you can put subscribers into a sales sequence for your offer. The emails should raise their awareness level of the problem you solve, show them the solution, and sprinkle in a bit of urgency so they buy.\nWith a social media account and email list alone, you can pull in a hefty income over time. This is an ultra-lean one-person business model. 3-4 hours a day (possibly less) of work \u2014 IF you have a solid offer / offer stack.\nIf you want access to the step-by-step email marketing roadmap, you can get it inside MMHQ.\nYour Offer\nFor beginners, your offer is your product or service. It is what you SELL. You have to sell something if you want to make money, that\u2019s a given (that not many people understand). Stop trying to make passive income when you don\u2019t have active income.\n\u201cDan, what do I sell?\u201d\nWhat are you interested in? What do you have experience in? What do you have results in? Have you solved a problem in your life through trial and error? Can you help people navigate that trial and error? What are the people that you follow selling and could you sell the same thing? (Buyers buy again, don\u2019t reinvent the wheel).\nI tried freelancing for 3 years, finally made it work, then wrote a book on how I did it. I knew that freelancing books were already selling, so I created my own and sold it to the people that trusted me over the competition (your personal brand eliminates competition).\nI loved planners, got results from them, created my own, and sold it (some of you know it as the Power Planner).\nAfter freelancing, I created a marketing consulting offer and targeted creators. Why? Because I saw other people selling it, knew how to take creators from point A to point B, and sold it for $8,000. This sounds absurd to some because you haven\u2019t started yet. Again, like playing a game, you have no idea what happens later in the game because you haven\u2019t taken the first step.\nNow, there are a few things to take into account here:\nPeople don\u2019t care about everything inside your product or service, they care about the SPECIFIC result that you can get them (and everything that helps them get that result)\nYou can create a compelling guarantee even if you don\u2019t have results. This is what will make you the most money.\nYou must make the journey from point A (problem) to point B (problem solved) as simple and straightforward as possible. The easier you can make it for the buyer to implement it into their life, the better. Systems above all.\nStop trying to solve every problem. Focus on one burning, biological problem. Test different angles and double down until you see your desired sales.\nAt the end of the day, you either have a traffic problem or an offer problem. JK Molina said it best:\n\"It's always a traffic or offer problem\" concept changed my life\n\nNot enough money? Improve your offer or get more traffic\n\nNot enough girls? Get better (offer) or meet more girls (traffic)\n\nThere's always a solution. And it's one of those two.\n\u2014 JK MOLINA (@OneJKMolina) February 11, 2022\nIf you can\u2019t make money, that\u2019s why. Anything other than that is a consistency and iteration problem.\nIf you want my Godfather Offer Framework and Advanced Marketing Roadmap\u2026. again, it\u2019s inside MMHQ lol (everything is inside MMHQ).\nEnding it here. Have an amazing weekend my friends, make it count.\nDan Koe"

You are asking the wrong questions. There are only a few skills that you need to learn. The others you learn should be the result of your innate curiosity. Taking small risks with your time for a potentially massive payout. Letting (good) novelty be your guide (per the last Mastery Letter).\nLet me break down what you should learn in the simplest way possible. If you follow this learning path, you will never have to worry about money again \u2014 given you can stay on the path for 1 year minimum.\nBecoming Valuable\nIn the material world, your perceived value is correlated with the amount of problems you solve. In the personal sense \u2014 improving yourself within the eternal markets (health, wealth, and relationships) turns you into a \u201chigh-value\u201d individual. People gravitate towards you because you fill a hole in their life. You solve a problem.\nIn the business world, these \u2018improvements\u2019 translate into the ability to solve biological problems for others \u2014 as you\u2019ve already solved them for yourself. The thing is, you need to understand how to package up and communicate this value. You need to attract people. Followers. Prospects. Customers.\nImproving yourself is only one piece of the puzzle. It relates to an education business more than anything. Coaching, programs, digital products, and the rest. This is tertiary but necessary to set the scene. It takes time to be able to monetize these skills \u2014 because it takes time to solve these problems for yourself.\nWhile you are improving yourself, here are the skills you should acquire:\nEvergreen Skills\nThere are an abundance of skills that content creators create a lot of noise about. Yelling at you to learn them so you can pull in some kind of online income. I want to take it back to the root. The skills that will have the most impact and fast-track your way to monetizing anything you want.\nThere are 2 categories within the evergreen skills that will always hold value. They allow you to create and display your offerings to the open market.\nEvergreen Skill Tree\nThe first category I call The Medium. There are two mediums. Writing and speaking. Writing is the foundation of proper, articulate speaking and should be understood first. Writing \u2014 the written word \u2014 is how you organize and deliver your thoughts in the modern world. Communication with other human beings \u2014 in its root form \u2014 is writing.\nThere are an abundance of resources online to learn how to write. I will teach you how to learn in future issues of this letter, but I can and will not give you step-by-step advice. That defeats the purpose of the entire journey. If I give you exact steps \u2014 as you will learn \u2014 it will not be fulfilling. You will quit as fast as you started. You need to let curiosity drive you. Start the snowball of momentum through self-education and diving into the unknown. Once you learn to walk, you can run. Once you learn to write, you can speak.\nThe second category of evergreen skills is The Message. Marketing and sales. How you write and speak to capture attention \u2014 the focus of others \u2014 to promote your solution. These are umbrella labels for understanding advertising, psychology, human nature, capturing attention, and what drives our decision-making. Without an understanding of these, you cannot write or speak effectively. You can learn a lot about these skills through self-awareness and observation of others. Paying attention to what they focus on and why they focus on it.\nThis is how you warm people up to your value. This is how you spark behavior change. Behavior change is the only metric that matters. Why? It means they will see positive results in their life. This is how you get paid for your efforts. Without marketing and sales, you will not make an income.\nFor some, these have a negative connotation because you have had a negative experience with them. Your negative focus on a message with negative energy created a negative reaction. Detach from this belief and see these skills for what they are \u2014 a way to spread your positive message and solve the deep problems of others. If you don\u2019t market and sell your solution, you will market and sell others\u2019 solutions for life.\nWriting, speaking, marketing, and sales are the 4 skills that will set you up for a lucrative online career. If you pursue these through your own curiosity and don\u2019t find a path to take\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\nShameless-mid-newsletter-plug: Marketing and sales are the core teachings of the business side of Modern Mastery HQ. Hundreds of resources, courses, roadmaps, and personalized support for you to find your lucrative path.\nComplimentary Skills\nComplementary skills allow you to further the impact of evergreen skills. Photography, videography, web and graphic design, technical proficiency, audio engineering, business management, and the rest.\nUnderstanding these skills one-by-one will amplify the effect of your evergreen skills and vice versa. They are the creative, technical, and business skills that allow you to display, visualize, and scale the impact of your evergreen skills.\nThese are what the majority of people learn first. The downside: they never learn to build online leverage or sell their products and services for a high price online. They fall into the \u201cstarving artist\u201d trap. Avoid this at all costs by prioritizing evergreen skill acquisition.\nYour evergreen skills can be used to market, sell, and monetize your complementary skills. All of these skills can be used to display your value relating to your interests and problems you\u2019ve solved for yourself. As you trek along your self-education journey, these will make themselves apparent. Different projects require different complementary skills.\nAs a one-person business, you must learn many of these to even survive. Most of you know my story (and those of many other successful solopreneurs). I tried freelancing with multiple different complementary skills. Started a digital art page. Multiple eCom brands. And more. Everything changed when I started building an audience, learned marketing and sales, and focused on what would pull in revenue.\nA Note On Saturation\nMost eternal markets are saturated. There are a lot of competitors. Most of them are beginners. Most of them have not even hit the \u201cvaluable\u201d stage. Very few are above average in the evergreen skills.\nI do not want you to get discouraged as we dive into irreplaceability. That is a temporal game. It takes time. Understand that you can make an exceptional amount of money with curiosity, evergreen skills, and a few complementary skills. They all bleed into each other. They are interconnected.\nBecoming Irreplaceable\nTo earn a living wage (not surviving wage), you must become valuable. To generate infinite income, you must become irreplaceable. In today\u2019s world, becoming valuable is synonymous with being a commodity. Everyone can offer some form of value in terms of the skills they\u2019ve acquired. Few can offer an irreplaceable stack of specific, applicable skills and knowledge to a unique situation that gets results.\nThe ability to guarantee that a problem is solved through a system of your design. Skill acquisition is necessary as we have discussed, but specific knowledge allows you to utilize those skills to the highest magnitude. You are able to fill the holes that others were not able to fill. If you want to become valuable, know the rules. If you want to become irreplaceable, know when to break them.\nThe Skill Matrix\nThis is where the eternal markets, learning, solving your own problems, and experience come into play. Becoming irreplaceable is less about what problem you solve and more about how you solve it. I will be writing a letter about The Solutions Economy and The Experience Model in the coming weeks \u2014 but for now, understand that your ability to apply knowledge through your skillset is what matters.\nBig players are irreplaceable because of their vast experience. They solved their own problems > gained experience > started a service business (consulting, coaching, freelancing) > gained experience + started developing their own unique system for getting results > added a dash of persistence and iteration > productized their system > repeated the cycle.\nGoing even further: the path to irreplaceability involves open-mindedness (being able to pivot and learn), studying all surrounding areas of your main offering, researching all sides, not becoming dogmatic about one way of doing things, etc. If you put yourself in a box, your income will remain in a box. Capped.\nJack of all trades, master of one.\nRather than focusing all of your energy on increasing your income \u2014 you must focus on increasing your income while reducing your time invested. Constantly iterating, systemizing, productizing, and not settling because you hit $20,000/month as a service business. Especially when you can hit $1 million/month while working less.\nMany have not reached this level. I do not want to confuse or overwhelm you. Start with the evergreen and complementary skills. Start building leverage by growing an audience. Start a service business, help for free, and develop your system. The path will reveal itself to you after.\nAs always, if you want step-by-step processes, strategies, and my 3 beginner courses (starting a service business, growing an audience, and building digital real estate) that were taken down everywhere else, join MMHQ.\nDan Koe"

        "content": "This won\u2019t be another meditation guide. This won\u2019t be me telling you to add more material things to your life. This won\u2019t be a \u201cquick trick or hack.\u201d\nThis is a series of concepts that you must understand.\nThis newsletter could have been titled:\n\u201cHow to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cThe only thing you need to live a good life.\u201d\n\u201cHow to live.\u201d\nThis concept is crucial for navigating the modern world. Take your time as you read through this. Take notes and practice.\nThis takes time. It took your entire life to be culturally conditioned into an unhappy state. It could take years \u2014 or a moment of surrender \u2014 to deprogram the negativity that\u2019s been planted in your head.\nWe will start with a quote from Alan Watts:\nA person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. By thoughts I mean specifically \u201cchatter in the skull\u201d\u2026 perpetual and compulsive repetition of words\u2026 of reckoning and calculating.\nI\u2019m not saying thinking is bad. Like everything else, it\u2019s useful in moderation. A good servant, but a bad master \u2013 and all so-called civilized peoples have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive. Through excessive thinking, they have lost touch with reality.\nMost of us would have rather money than tangible wealth\u2026 and a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed\u2026 and to read about it the next day in the newspaper is oddly more fun for us than the original event. This is a disaster.\nTo get in touch with reality there is an art of meditation\u2026 It is the art of temporarily silencing the mind\u2026 of stopping the \u201cchatter in the skull\u201d. Of course you can\u2019t force your mind to be silent. That would be like trying to smooth ripples in water with a flat iron. Water become cool and clear only when left alone.\nAlan Watts\nYou\u2019ve Been Conditioned Into Mediocrity\nWhat is \u201cconditioning?\u201d Think of the gym. You condition yourself through repetition of a specific exercise. As a result, you build muscle or cardiovascular capacity. If you don\u2019t go to the gym, you are performing repetitive actions that result in the opposite. There is no middle ground. You are either growing or decaying. Small increases in muscle, small increases in fat, small decreases in muscle, small decreases in fat. Repetition often goes unnoticed.\nCultural conditioning of the mind is the enemy here. This is the cause of your excess \u201cchatter in the skull.\u201d The thing that keeps you unhappy. Thoughts, beliefs, biases, reactions, ideologies, political stances, and everything else that blurs your perception. External projections that have been hammered into your head through repetition.\nYour perception \u2014 for the sake of this email \u2014 is your worldview. How you interpret things. Your \u201clens\u201d that you see things through. Cultural conditioning has \u201cblurred\u201d this \u201clens.\u201d As a child, you existed in your natural state without this conditioning. You were playful, loving, and curious. As you aged, these traits were suppressed. They were blurred through conditioning. This conditioning prevents you from \u201cseeing\u201d things as they are.\nPerception VS Reality\nThere is perception, based on the lens of the character you are playing. Your personality, beliefs, and biases. And there is reality, based on who you are. Truth. God. Consciousness. What Is. The All. The Universe. Whatever you want to call it. Different belief systems call it different things. These are lenses of perception that some adopt to lead lives that are closer to Truth.\nSeparating Being From Becoming\nWho you think you are is not who you are. Who you are is what you are doing. Not what you have done. Who you are is the being that is moving with life. As you walk down the road you see buildings, trees, streets, and other things that will be there with you even when you are miles away. They aren\u2019t left in the past. They don\u2019t have beliefs and emotions that are temporal. The building will be here in 2 years unless destroyed. You will be here in 2 years unless destroyed. Your thoughts, emotions, and feelings will not be. Negativity cannot exist in reality.\nWho you think you are is a character that you are playing. Who you are becoming. A disguise you are putting on to fit in. A fabrication of the mind. The result of rampant \u2014 or controlled \u2014 thinking. Thoughts, given life through focus. Turned into negative emotions and feelings through perception. Automatic and unconscious reactions to the external stimuli you are exposed to. Accuracy of focus will determine how much you suffer in life.\nWe all have the desire to transcend the self. To fully serve The All, Universe, God, etc. Before we do this, we must self-actualize. Some may be familiar with Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs.\nMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy Of Needs\nMeaning, before self-transcendence, we must self-actualize. Hit the gym, start a business, gain independence, and nurture our mind. In order to self-actualize, we must play the game of life. In order to play the game of life, we must first create our character. Consciously. Not through cultural conditioning. Through Conscious Conditioning.\nOur goal is to become aware of this separation and bridge the gap. The gap between reality and concepts. God and the word \u201cGod.\u201d Nature and fabrication. Immaterial and material. Light and dark. Love and hate. Truth and false. Stripping away the perceptions that do not serve you so your actions are intrinsically driven (closer to Truth) \u2014 not extrinsically assigned (obstruction of Truth).\nRemove the obstruction from your mind and you have wisdom. Remove the obstruction from your heart and you have love.\nYou must realize that your character (who you are becoming) is there to serve you. That your beliefs are malleable. That your negative thoughts can be turned positive \u2014 closer to Truth, at any point in time. We must create the character through repetition of positive thoughts, beliefs, and actions to move us towards positive outcomes in our life.\nThis will allow you to attract and build the things that result in money, meaning, health, and other things that have been masked by faulty perception. Allowing you to eventually transcend and pass on your lessons (which is the distilled meaning of life per ancient and modern teachers.)\nI dove into the whole \u201cbeing VS becoming\u201d thing more on today\u2019s podcast. It may help you understand it better.\nThe Conscious Conditioning Process\nThrough conscious conditioning, you create your own \u201clens\u201d to view the world from. You perceive things more accurately. You upgrade your mental programming. You can either be culturally conditioned into failure and mediocrity \u2014 or you can consciously condition your character into favorable outcomes. Program or be programmed.\nBefore you go through this process, you may want to read up on The Creation Pyramid and download The Power Planner. This will give you extra guidance and something to refine along the way. Structure is king, but distractions will still come our way. They are impossible to avoid. This process will help you navigate them and transmute negative energy into positive.\nYou will be conditioning your focus onto something positive so this process becomes habit. It took years for your current thought processes to be solidified. This is a lifelong journey and practice.\nThis is a 6 step process:\n1) Pause\nWhen a thought pops into your head, pause before that thought becomes emotion, belief, trait, or reaction. This takes practice.\nIf the thought goes rancid immediately, bring your focus to what I call \u201canchors.\u201d Anchors are places to bring your focus to neutralize and transmute negative feelings and emotions.\nThe breath is the most readily available to you. Some schedule this via mindfulness meditation. You can bring your focus to your breath at any time.\nOther\u2019s include music, nature bathing, physical activity, journaling (as we will discuss), and any other activities that imply potential flow-state or stress regulation.\n2) Question\nAsk yourself questions that will reveal the thought\u2019s true nature.\n\u201cWhy am I thinking this?\u201d\n\u201cIs this a thought I\u2019ve had before? Where did it lead?\u201d\n\u201cIs this rational? Should it be given energy?\u201d\nLet questions trigger more questions. This shines awareness and may dissolve potential problems outright.\nThe next best way of doing this is through CC (conscious conditioning) journaling. Getting your thoughts out on paper. Writing out the questions, and answering them right there. This is a crucial habit to develop. Having your thoughts on paper provides immediate relief. It is an incredible self-awareness practice.\nQuestioning. Is. Crucial.\nThis is the most important step. Why? Understanding. This is where you uncover where the root of your faulty perception lies.\nHabit formation and other self-help advice is worthless if you are not aware of your attachments and negative aspects of your identity. You must attack the root. Question your thoughts until they strike a chord. Until you feel that negative energy building up. From that energy, you have shined awareness on the issue. Now you can work in the opposite direction.\nYou cannot understand a potential positive future. You can only understand a negative familiar past. Now you have a point to work away from. Towards the potential positive future.\nAs an example, \u201cI am lazy\u201d won\u2019t cut it as a place to work away from. What are you attached to that is making you lazy? No productivity advice will help as much as uncovering and understanding this blockage.\n3) Objectify\nUnderstand that this thought \u2014 or negative reaction that you uncovered \u2014 is not a part of you. It is an object. A separate entity. Only given life when given focus. A tool that can be used for the destruction or creation of your character.\nWrite this down along with your thoughts.\n4) Reframe\nNow you want to turn the self-destructive negative into a self-creative positive. Implying consciousness. Something that will push you towards an optimal outcome. Your vision, goals, and priorities.\nHere are a few reframes:\nGuilt to gratitude \u2014 Jocko Willink felt guilty for leaving his team while in the military. He had to consciously condition this negative belief into gratitude for being able to go home.\nFailure to success \u2014 Understanding that one failure is feedback. It is a rung in the ladder of success.\nCope to curiosity \u2014 Instead of being closed-minded to an opportunity that presents itself (most online business opportunities, this conscious conditioning process, etc), be open-minded and ask \u201cwhat would happen if I tried this out?\u201d\nIf you want to understand this more, study polarity. Fear opposes \u2014 and can transmute to \u2014 love. Similar to all negatives.\n5) Characterize\nHow can you use this reframe to move you in a positive direction? What actions can you take? Is there anything you can do?\nConsult with aspirational archetypes such as Jesus, spiritual teachers, and positive role models that you \u201cvibe\u201d with. What would they do in your situation?\n6) Align\nRemind yourself of your vision, goals, and priorities per The Creation Hierarchy and how this positive trait can help you move along the path.\nAlignment = having your character act in accordance with who you are. Positive, truthful, God-like actions that result in self-actualization (enlightened selfishness), self-transcendence (enlightened selflessness), and heaven on Earth. Advancing the collective human consciousness. Playing your part and spreading the positive message.\nThis. Takes. Time.\nWhile listening to an Actualized lecture (I listen to philosophy lectures each night to \u201cthink big picture\u201d and fall asleep), he mentioned the importance of studying philosophy. We all get wrapped up in the technical details of life when in reality they mean nothing. Technical details solve technical problems. You are not tech. You are consciousness blobbed together that may never be fully understood.\nStudying philosophy and spirituality put\u2019s your brain in \u201cbig picture thinking\u201d mode. I can\u2019t explain the phenomena, but through studying daily \u2014 my days are stress and worry-free. I \u201ccare less.\u201d Things just fall into place as I act through my intuition that is not obstructed by technical thought.\nIt was also mentioned that it took years to start to understand these philosophical concepts \u2014 then it hits you all at once. All of this spiritual stuff is hitting me all at once. It makes sense that it doesn\u2019t make sense and the root of all of our problems is trying to make sense.\nBy not making sense, you be and become in alignment with Truth.\nDan Koe"

        "content": "There is one overwhelming problem that we keep coming back to. It has made me question myself to infinity just to realize that questioning is the problem in itself. The problem of problems is solved by not giving life to the problem.\nThe problem I am speaking of is thinking. Chatter in the skull.\nPer the main teachings of spiritualists and philosophers \u2014 we must learn to silence the mind.\n\u201cSilencing the mind\u201d may seem impractical. Like it will take away from our material progress in this world. I disagree.\nHere\u2019s why:\nPreface\nI will talk a lot about thinking in this letter. A majority of the time I am speaking of unconscious thought. Reactions, identifications, biases, beliefs, and negative energy that you are not aware of. Consider this me making the distinction between thinking itself and thinking with a purpose. Conscious thought. Thinking about your thinking is conscious and implies presence and awareness. However\u2026 I am still of the mind that even conscious thought should be moderated.\nResisting What Is\nThe more productivity advice I hear the more I realize people are trying to escape the flow of nature. Force instead of flow. This had me in deep reflection this last week. My most productive points in life are the ones where I:\nFollow my intuition & curiosity\nMake the conscious decision to go all-in\nHave experience that matches the challenge\nHave clarity on execution of the project\nMaintain momentum until completion\nI don\u2019t need all of the productivity hacks and advice to pump out 3-4 hours of work. Sometimes even 12 hours and sleepless nights. When this scenario occurs, you cannot pull me away from my work. Work has become play that is more \u201cfun\u201d than any other activity I could participate in. Nothing will stop me from making the idea in my head a reality.\nThis is a result of alignment. Everything falls into place. It \u201cclicks.\u201d The passion potion of neurochemicals floods your brain. It all makes sense and you execute on the micro vision.\nThere was no resistance. There was no \u201csecond thought.\u201d It happened because it was supposed to. Through the macro pursuit of mastery and improvement \u2014 my mind was open to the infinite opportunities that pass by my eyes on a daily basis. Out of those infinite opportunities, one of them caught my attention. Raised my dopamine levels, signaling that I should pursue it, so I did. No thought. No mind. No ego, limiting beliefs, or paralysis by analysis had the chance of holding me back.\nSome call this divine inspiration. I can get down with that. When you are connected to Source \u2014 by not thinking \u2014 you operate according to your Dharmic path. Your destiny. Your talents surface and you cultivate strength through action.\nThis does not eliminate the utility of modern productivity hacks. This is an observation of multiple cycles of life that led to exponential growth. There is merit in structuring your work, but I would be lying if I said that my quality of work was higher when I tried to force it.\nMental Minimalism\nThe goal with all of this is to help you understand the concept of psychological time. The past, present, and future. By thinking, you are split. Your being is in the present but your mind is in a familiar past or predictable future. This is where all perceived problems exist. We live out the same painful, negative experiences because they are familiar. We have experienced them before. This causes negative reactions, biases, and beliefs. Thinking \u2014 in this case \u2014 should be moderated to the best of your current ability and moderated further through lifelong practice.\nIn the optimal situation, we would not think much. Barely at all. But society has been structured in a way that requires thought and education to function within the system. Psychological time can make you a slave to this system. It has been perpetuated thanks to the internet. Mental health issues are at an all-time high. Thinking and doing must be balanced.\nNote: Reading, writing, socializing, listening and creating is not synonymous with thinking. In fact, thinking often takes away from the quality of these experiences. Are you engaged with the present moment when you are speaking with someone? Or are you blocked from deep connection by creating problems in your head?\nWe must think strategically. We must frame our focus via The Creation Hierarchy. By writing out your vision, goals, values, and priorities \u2014 your subconscious will follow suit. You will naturally move in a positive direction when engaged with the present moment. This is where tools like visualization, affirmation, and other structured thinking methods become useful.\nNot only can these be used to tap into the energy of a potential \u2014 not predictable \u2014 future, but they eliminate the need to think about the opportunities that align with you. They are a dot in your memory that allows pattern recognition to come into play. You will know (from a feeling of excitement) what you should pursue.\nAgain, this should be moderated. Thinking is a tool, not a master. Doing should fill the majority of your days, a state of no-mind. Active engagement of your senses. Awestruck by the depth of the present moment. Listening fully in conversations. Feeling fully when with your significant other. Awareness of the space around you. Connected to the radiating positive energy of our Source.\nUnderstand that you do not need to think in order to do. Thinking often dampens the quality of doing. You need not think when you are connected to Infinite Intelligence \u2014 the root of all knowledge \u2014 that modern society has built on and used against us.\nThe Flow Formula\nWhen you have framed your focus, meaning you can think less, you create the potential to tap into flow state. To flow with life instead of resist it. There are degrees of flow you can tap into. The present moment gives you instant access to a degree of flow. The act of creation gives you access to a higher degree of flow. Per my previous experience and research, these are the things that must come into play.\n1) Curiosity \u2013 you must be open and attentive to what pulls and holds your attention in alignment with your interests.\n2) Objective \u2013 a short to long term goal, project, or vision. Write this down and remind yourself of it, but do not overthink. The challenge of reaching this objective should be slightly above your skill level.\n3) Clarity \u2013 goals toward your vision and tasks toward your goals. If you are unsure of the steps to take \u2014 you must educate yourself. Learn via the internet.\n4) Intention \u2013 what you are stretching towards. You are stretching towards the challenge that the objective presents.\n5) Action \u2013 simplified action. Do not think past the first step. Take the first step from a place of inspiration (created by the previous steps).\nThese are all implied through The Creation Hierarchy. If you have that in place, you need not do much thinking. Reminders, reflection, and refinement morning and night will do the trick.\nEnding it here.\nEnjoy your weekend my friends,\nDan Koe"

        "heading": "Why Productivity Advice Is Ruining Your Life",
        "content": "Have you noticed how many people overwork themselves then see it as something to be proud of?\nThis is the state of modern productivity. Hustle culture screams that \u201cSleep is the for the weak!\u201d and \u201cWork until you no longer have to introduce yourself.\u201d This is a nice sentiment but is missing the point.\nIn a world that glorifies quick work and fast results, the art of singular focus and meaningful long-term work has been forgotten. It\u2019s no wonder that there is a growing gap between the successful and unsuccessful. We have forgotten the compounding effects of focus.\nWith this letter, I want to provide you with 2 frameworks I\u2019ve developed that will radically transform your productivity.\nThe Paradox Of Productivity\nCreatives, entrepreneurs, and other impactful individuals attribute their success not to how much they work, but to how much they rest.\nFrom the book Rest by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang:\n\u201cThe clever man may work smarter, not harder, they say, but the creative man doesn\u2019t work at all.\u201d\nPang also describes how the ancient Greeks saw rest as a gift, the pinnacle of civilized life. The Roman Stoics argued that you cannot have a good life without good work. Every ancient society saw work and rest as necessary for a good life. One provided means to live, the other gave meaning to life.\nThe first thing that comes to mind when \u201crest\u201d or \u201crelaxation\u201d are mentioned is the modern interpretation of self-care. Laying on the couch eating potato chips while binge-watching your favorite Netflix show. Having one too many bowls of ice cream while drowning yourself in wine because your BFF told you to \u201ctreat yourself.\u201d Anything else that can be viewed as relaxation, but is just laziness in disguise.\nWhen you go to the gym, do you lift to the best of your ability for 12 hours a day? Of course not. You schedule time for high output, prioritize recovery, and have a structured training regimen. The problem stems from people having a low mental operating state. A lack of creativity and good ideas has become a normal state. You are in a constant state of mental overtraining because you are trying to be like everyone else \u2014 you know where that leads.\nLike productive work, you must schedule time for intentional rest. First, we need to swap your current definition of self-care for the enlightened version of active recovery.\nI introduce to you, the Fill \u2013 Empty \u2013 Use framework.\nFill \u2014 Empty \u2014 Use\nA few months ago I had a tweet go viral:\nFill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization\n\nEmpty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation\n\nUse your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) November 5, 2021\nThis is my personal way of using the Fill \u2014 Empty \u2014 Use framework, so let\u2019s talk about how you can use it in your creative endeavors.\nIt is up to you to fit this into your daily routine. Experiment with each aspect of it. If your energy is highest in the morning, schedule your work and rest around that. The same goes for night owls.\nThis works best for those that are working on something they are passionate about. A side-business, hobby project, or creative endeavor that you chose to do. Not something that is assigned to you. You must be able to pursue your curiosities, leading to passion and purpose. This framework will give you creative firepower, the second one will help you build momentum into long-term discipline. The end goal is making a hefty income while pursuing your life\u2019s work.\nFill\nYou cannot produce if you do not consume. Working from an empty brain is like driving a car without gas in the tank. It\u2019s not going to work. You need to consume books, articles, podcasts, and other information related to your interests. If you love design, read a book relative to your current skill level. If you want to build a business, start consuming business content.\nI personally recommend a foundation of reading books or listening to audiobooks. Author\u2019s spend 10+ years gaining experience, condensing it into a few hundred pages, and selling it at an affordable price. You can consume this in 5-10 hours. The ROI compared to other content is unmatched. Podcasts are my second favorite.\nEmpty\nThe famous quote from Bruce Lee says it all:\n\u201cEmpty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.\u201d\nThis is where rest comes into play. Instead of \u201cself-care,\u201d we are using the majority of our free time for active recovery. I like to think of these as meditative activities. Activities that have the potential of putting you into a flow state. Activities that make you become one with what you are doing. Activities that make you flow with life.\nGoing to the gym, running, martial arts, yoga, or going on a hike. Nature bathing \u2014 walking in nature and using your 5 senses to become more present. Mindful activities like meditation, walking, and breathwork.\nJournaling is another popular method of \u201cemptying your brain.\u201d Every night, write out everything on your mind. Negative thoughts, how your day went, what you are doing tomorrow, and the rest. This is also a deep sleep hack.\nOne crucial piece to emptying your brain: you need somewhere to capture your ideas while you are performing these meditative activities. If you filled your brain, you will have great ideas during this time. Don\u2019t let the ideas get lost to time. My main method for idea capture is having a running note in my phone\u2019s notes. I refer to this when it\u2019s time to use my brain.\nLastly, you must upkeep your health fundamentals. The brain and body work in unison. An unhealthy body results in a non-creative mind. Hydrate, sleep, and eat nutrient-dense foods.\nNot only are these superior ways to regulate stress and emotions, but they also contribute to progress. When you aren\u2019t actively trying to think, you give your subconscious mind room to breathe. This phenomenon was popularized as \u201cshower thoughts,\u201d but can be a valuable weapon in your mental arsenal. You have better ideas when you aren\u2019t trying to have better ideas.\nThese methods are incredible at training self-awareness. A crucial skill in life. One that will come in handy when we discuss novelty, efficiency, and synchronicity.\nLegendary advertiser, David Ogilvy, used this method to craft his big ideas. He would brainstorm ideas for his ads, put down his work, and with time \u2014 the perfect idea would come to him. Ogilvy is not the only one that uses this method. Quentin Tarantino and other legendary individuals use this in their creative process.\nUse\nThis is simple. Have time scheduled for focused work on your current project related to your goals. When you do this is entirely up to you. We will discuss how to do this best once we understand why we are doing it this way.\nNovelty \u2014 Efficiency \u2014 Synchronicity\nThe reason Fill \u2014 Empty \u2014 Use framework works so well is due to the Law Of Inspired Action.\nIn a nutshell, when you are inspired by everyday stimuli and experiences \u2014 you feel pulled to create. You feel the pull of something begging for mastery. It is not a chore, it happens naturally if you are truly inspired. To be inspired, you need to pursue your interests. Not others.\nYou must not deny your curious nature. This is why people hated reading in grade school and continue to hate their dead-end jobs. Zero inspiration or personal interest. A lack of choice in their pursuits. Denying the call to explore the infinite potential that lies in the unknown.\nNovelty\nThe human brain loves new things. Novel experiences. Dopamine is the driving force here, it separates signal from noise. Action from distraction. This is abused when the action is not in alignment with who you want to become. That is\u2026 when you don\u2019t have a vision, goals, or priorities that you defined.\nDopamine can quickly throw you into a negative spiral when you consume the wrong things. Examples are self-deprecating memes on social media, mindless entertainment, porn, and other mind-hijackers that came from recent technological advancements.\nHumans crave novelty\n\nMedia companies know this.\n\nSo they give you what you want. Making you a slave to cheap dopamine.\n\nIf you read books, went outside, pushed yourself, and found novelty away from the screen.\n\nYou would become obsessed with progress instead of self-destruction.\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) December 27, 2021\nEfficiency\nWe understand that you have to use your brain, but we need structure. We need efficiency so it doesn\u2019t take you 12 hours to accomplish 3 hours of work. Efficiency is the act of making things so stupidly simple that you would look stupid doing otherwise.\nHere are 6 rapid-fire tips for getting into a deep flow state. This will only work when you act in alignment with your goals and interests, meaning you have intention behind your actions. You are stretching towards something. Novelty and synchronicity must exist.\nTip 1) Block off and schedule time for using your brain, deep work. Put on it on your calendar. Write it on your wall. Write it on your shower walls with a dry erase marker. Make it so you know that you are working at that specific time.\nTip 2) Have your day planned the night before (use my free planner if you don\u2019t have one). Remind yourself of your vision, goals, and priorities. Give yourself 2-3 lever-moving tasks. Some people can handle more. Start with 2-3 and increase as you see fit. Lever-moving tasks are the ones that result in the most progress towards your goals.\nTip 3) Put yourself in an environment conducive to deep work. My favorites are a coffee shop, hotel lobby, airplane, or somewhere that is separate from where you sleep.\nTip 4) Set a timer for 45 minutes to 2 hours. Again, you must experiment with this. This is time for singular focus. No distractions. Write, design, connect, edit, publish, build. Use the Freedom app to block distracting apps if you have to.\nTip 5) Listen to music without lyrics \u2014 or music that puts you in a good mood. Some of my favorites are dubstep, EDM, and Hans Zimmer soundtracks.\nTip 6) When the timer is done, get out of your chair and go on a 10-minute walk. During this walk, remind yourself of your next task, what goal you are working towards, and why you are working towards it \u2014 what is the end goal? Sometimes I will listen to an audiobook to spark more novelty and synchronicity, giving me energy for the next work session.\nThese are all malleable. My formula is not perfect. Life is a series of science experiments. Find what works for you.\nSynchronicity\nSynchronicity is what kicks you into overdrive and sustains long-term progress. In psychology, there is a phenomenon known as pattern recognition which describes \u201ca cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information from memory.\u201d\nMeaning: a more potent form of novelty. You are connecting dots and can quite literally feel the progress. More good dopamine.\nWhen you empty your brain with the Fill \u2014 Empty \u2014 Use framework we discussed before, you are creating anchor points, physically and mentally. You create a dot that can be connected to another dot when you fill your brain.\nSynchronicity is the process of connecting the dots over time per my definition. Per a quick Google search\u2019s definition:\n\u201c\u2026spiritual synchronicities are strategically orchestrated and perfectly aligned to deliver a message, provide guidance, or provide reassurance that we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d\nSeemingly unrelated concepts make more sense because they connect with other previous ideas. This pulls you back into a meditative flow state. You have a constant supply of energy that comes from momentum \u2014 which is arguably the greatest feeling. Falling in love with the process. Becoming obsessed with it.\nSynchronicities start to appear more as you make more progress with your life\u2019s work. You are able to maintain degrees of flow states throughout your day.\nI would argue that synchronicities \u2014 relating to ideas coming together \u2014 are the secret of the successful. It is the perceived genius in their fusion of big ideas. It is the fuel to their internal fire to make a dent in the world. It is consistent and compounding mental, physical, and spiritual gains manifested in their business.\nA feeling that can only be experienced through experience.\nAll of this sounds great, but it means nothing without action.\nThese frameworks and processes will make taking action easier, but the decision is entirely yours. You may have bad habits that are deeply ingrained into your life. It is your job to become aware of these. Consciously map out who you want to become, and act with consistency.\nThis is the only worthwhile way to live. You are either consciously living or unconsciously dying. Start by adding 5 minutes of filling your brain, 5 minutes of emptying your brain, and 5 minutes of using your brain. That\u2019s all it takes to start the eventual snowball of momentum. Time is not an excuse. Do what you can.\nIf you enjoyed this issue of The Mastery Letter, let me know on Twitter. Write a tweet with your thoughts and tag me (@thedankoe). I\u2019ve been doing my best to deliver top quality to you all, and will continue doing so.\nEnjoy your weekend,\n\u2013 Dan Koe"

        "heading": "What Mushrooms (The Drug) Taught Me About Life & Business",
        "content": "Over the past years, I have experimented with psilocybin, magic mushrooms, on and off.\nDisclaimer: [insert disclaimer text here about not being an idiot and doing your own research before ingesting a chemical that can alter your mental state]\nThis past month I started experimenting again. Microdosing 1-2x a week because I can appreciate the power of this substance.\nThis last time around, I was taught a very important lesson. One about honeycomb and the infinite opportunities that are staring you straight in the face. Opportunities that allow you to appreciate, understand, master, and monetize anything that surrounds you.\nThe Iceberg Of Opportunity\nLet\u2019s start with the honeycomb. Yes, honeycomb. The beautiful and delicious byproduct of fuzzy little flying bugs. The last time I microdosed, I went to the local farmers market, was suckered into free samples of raw honey, and picked up this fine specimen.\n1 Pound Of Honeycomb\nNow, when most people see this honeycomb, that\u2019s it. It stops there. It looks tasty, they might buy some, but they fail to see the depth behind it. They fail to reap the benefits of curiosity because they are conditioned to get distracted. Wrapped up with the next task they need to accomplish, the notifications they need to check, constant internal dialogue\u2026 the list goes on.\nWhen you are curious, that is\u2026 when you are present, not distracted by \u201cchatter in the skull,\u201d negativity, or anything else that widens the gap between who you are and who you are becoming (per the last letter)\u2026 you open yourself up to the world. You allow your intrinsic intuition to notice the infinite novel experiences around you. Not the fabricated novelty that big business uses to keep you in the chains of cheap dopamine (per the last last last letter).\nThrough that curiosity, you see that the honeycomb is not just honeycomb. You question. You think. You dig for the novelty that creates synapses in your brain. Birthing chemicals that lead to motivation (the good kind), passion, purpose, and potential mastery.\nWhat is the process that created the honeycomb? How long does it take for it to be made? What kind of plant, tree, or flower did that specific honey come from? What is the beekeepers role? How do they manufacture the honey? How did it get into my hands? Why should people eat honey? Is there too much sugar in honey? Is sugar good or bad for you? What does bioenergetic nutrition look like and why does it promote consuming mass amounts of sugar? Does honey in coffee taste good? How is coffee made? Can I make a raw honey infused coffee, build a brand for Ray Peat zealots (bioenergetic nutrition model), and scale to $10M?\nThe Iceberg Of Opportunity\nDo you understand how deep this can go? Do you understand the importance of not getting distracted by modern advancements? Junk food, mindless social media, drama, and all other external stimuli? Because you are suppressing your natural \u2014 childlike \u2014 curiosity. Suppressing your potential.\nWake up.\nThe Infinite Potential Of Reality\nThe \u201cIceberg of Opportunity\u201d pertains to every little thing around you. Not just tangible or material objects. Thoughts, emotions, knowledge, etc. Spanning infinitely across all planes of reality.\nThe honeycomb is an iceberg. The cellular walls of the white comb is an iceberg. \u201cThis\u201d word is an iceberg. Everything surrounding you is an iceberg containing infinite icebergs.\nIcebergs Across The X Axis\nIcebergs Across The X Axis\nYou can start to see how deep this goes. You can start to understand the unfathomable essence of Infinity, Truth, God, Source, The All, etc.\nThe fabric of reality.\nIcebergs Across The X & Y Axis\nIcebergs Across The X & Y Axis\nIt doesn\u2019t stop at 2 dimensions. We can add a Z axis. We can add an ABCDEFG axis. That illustrates reality. Icebergs spanning across infinite planes in infinite directions. The unknown that begs to be explored when you are in the present moment \u2014 not projecting into the familiar past or predictable future. Not being blinded by your negative perceptions, ideologies, biases, beliefs, and everything else you hold onto so tight. Staying in the same familiar bubble of comfort. Living out experiences that you have already had. Suppressing your intuition. An early death.\nThe 4 Paths Into The Infinite Unknown\nOf course, you can\u2019t dive into anything and everything. You don\u2019t want to overwhelm yourself. You don\u2019t want to live your life in the potential future. That would just be mental masturbation.\nInstead, we want to have sex with the present moment. Planting and cultivating the seeds that will birth the reality we want for ourselves. You do this by pursuing your life\u2019s work. Pursuing your curiosity, letting nature do it\u2019s thing (neurochemicals aiding in purpose and passion), and going on to achieve autonomy and mastery.\nThere are 4 paths you can take here.\n1) Appreciation \u2013\u2013 instead of walking mindlessly and emotionally reacting to everything in life, appreciate things for the depth they hold. Let other\u2019s enjoy things because they see the depth and chose to pursue it. Be open to new things because it is not as shallow as you think. Be awestruck by the present moment. Flow through life with appreciation and gratitude.\n2) Understanding \u2014 when you feel the pull to go deeper, don\u2019t suppress it. Shiny object syndrome only exists when you quit the path of improvement altogether. Learning and understanding something will always aid in the infinitely interconnected essence of life. My story is a direct example of this. Understanding all sides makes you more of an expert than the narrow-minded single-study \u201cexperts.\u201d Understanding \u2014 not knowing \u2014 implies direct experience.\n3) Mastery \u2014 understanding makes you a jack-of-all-trades. Mastery makes you a jack-of-all-trades, master of one. The favorable outcome in today\u2019s marketplace and society. This takes trial, error, and small risk. Your path to mastery will change. All you must do is remain present and on the path. This is your life\u2019s work.\n4) Monetization \u2014 You can monetize anything nowadays. Above I gave the example of raw honey coffee for bioenergetic nutrition followers. If I wanted to, I could take that business to multiple 8 figures\u2026 but that is not my life\u2019s work. That is not where my intuition has led me.\nStarting The Mastery Process Now\nIn order to self-transcend, you must first self-actualize. In order to self-actualize, you need to play the game of money. You need to have enough capital and time to pursue your \u201ccalling.\u201d What is most aligned with your unique being.\nSince we talk about business a lot here, I will give you steps to take. These are the steps that every successful person I have spoken with has done to build leverage via the internet.\nAgain, not everything has to be monetized. Go all-in on one thing until you fulfill that purpose and phase of your life.\n1) Become curious about one iceberg. Curiosity is the spark of potential.\n2) Self-educate. Take advantage of the information available to you via the internet. Consume books, lectures, podcasts, and other content. Buy courses, coaching, or other specific knowledge that has proven results. LEARN.\n3) Start a real-world project. Gain practical experience via a service business or business model of your choice. Do free work that emulates what you would get paid for. Help others, understand them and the problems you solve for them. This will advance the learning process \u2014 you cannot skip this. (This does not need to be for business-sake. Just build something in the real world.)\n4) Learn the evergreen skills. The message: marketing and sales. The medium: writing and speaking. All icebergs within themselves. Start with the fundamentals. These will help you package up your knowledge into a solution to a problem you are solving. They help you display and communicate your value via modern tools and platforms. (I broke these down 2 newsletters ago).\n5) Build or buy distribution. My favorite traffic source is a personal brand (on social media). It allows me to pursue my interests, teach them, and monetize anything that aligns with my lifestyle. That is what I help others build. Start on something simple and scalable like Twitter, then branch out to other platforms. If you want to dabble with paid ads, SEO, or other traffic sources, feel free.\n6) Promote your \u201choney.\u201d You have a product or service, you have free distribution via social media, you have the skills to communicate your value \u2014 now all you need to do is promote.\n7) Productize and scale. If you want to hire employees and scale, go ahead, but don\u2019t discount the power of the one-person business model. Online education and individual power is growing and anyone can join in. Once you have results, you can package up your knowledge into infinitely replicable digital assets. You can sell how you made the \u201choney.\u201d You can sell how you sold the \u201choney.\u201d You can sell anything as long as the value exceeds the cost.\nIf you want step-by-step courses and roadmaps for personal branding, social media growth, marketing, sales, and developing yourself into a high-value individual, join MMHQ.\nMaximum Enjoyment\nThe lifestyle-first and one-person business approach to pursuing your life\u2019s work is the most fulfilling path you can take (in my humble opinion). There is a reason the world is moving towards this decentralized model, and you are still early to the party. Those that value self-education, self-sufficiency, and personal responsibility will thrive like no other.\nI will be diving into my thoughts behind this in the next letter. I will deconstruct \u201cThe Creator Economy\u201d in a way that I have not seen others do yet.\nBy understanding the concepts laid out in this letter, you can start to create a good life for yourself out of what most people see as just \u201choney.\u201d\nSo, I leave you with this final reminder. Wake up and stop letting random things steal your attention, focus, and dopamine.\nGet \u201cin touch with yourself\u201d to get in touch with the world, the Universe, God, and what lies beyond \u201choney.\u201d\nFrom this present state, follow your newfound intuition, your curiosity, and dive into the unknown aspects of life.\nThis is the only way you can learn the lessons that life has laid out for you.\nOne last question\u2026\nHow the hell can you be \u201cbored?\u201d\nDan Koe"

        "content": "Everyone wants to achieve great things, but nobody wants to focus on developing their craft for years on end.\n(Plot twist: everybody wants to focus on their craft, but nobody wants to do the internal work, detach from their faulty beliefs, pursue the unconventional path, and see through the projections of your friends, family, and culture)\nFear is standing in your way. Let go.\nThe Only Worthwhile Path\nThroughout your entire life, you have been conditioned to go down the path that others want for you. Everyone around you projects their fears, insecurities, and poor choices onto you. Aware or not, they do not want to see you do better than them. So they let out words and reactions with hopes to keep you at their same level.\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, most people are not happy. I mean, how could they be? Fried dopamine receptors from too much screen time and cheap entertainment. Low baseline energy from poor nutrition, lack of movement, and no sense of purpose. Perceptions that keep you closed off to the infinite opportunity that is staring you straight in the face. This is a disaster (for those that let it remain a disaster).\nHere\u2019s the thing, growth is natural. That is, as you become closer to nature, \u201cthe universe,\u201d or your authentic self \u2014 growth and progress is the only option when you detach from the things that are holding you back. Once you destroy your adopted, fear-based worldviews \u2014 you open yourself up to what is. Your intuition reveals itself. Your curiosity reveals itself. Your innate drive to lean into your innate masculine / feminine edge reveals itself. To build, protect, provide, nurture, support, etc.\nPersonal and professional development is a natural byproduct of \u201cletting go\u201d of the external things that do not serve you (and are out of your control). Resisting, fighting, and holding onto these things are what keep you in chains.\nThis dilemma reminds me of a great tweet by James Clear:\nI have a suspicion that most adults (75%+) could pick any skill\u2014excluding sports\u2014and work their way into the top 10% in the world simply by working exclusively on it every day for two years.\n\nBut almost nobody displays that degree of focus, so we will never know.\n\u2014 James Clear (@JamesClear) August 9, 2020\nFirst, I would argue that most people can make it into the top 1% \u2014 not 10%. (Those that intellectualize this \u201cstatistic\u201d will not reach the 1% as their mental chatter prevents them from taking action, let go). There are too many quality resources out there for building yourself and your business in record time. Yet people are held back by the momentary distractions that we discussed above. External stimuli that keep you in a bubble of familiarity and comfort.\nThe question is, where do you begin?\nI\u2019ve made you aware of these distractions \u2014 it is your job to be mindful of them on a moment-to-moment basis. Breathe and let them pass. Flow with the natural, positive way of life. This takes practice. Lifelong practice. Given some time, your curiosity will begin to pull you in the direction you were meant to go.\nWhen that time comes (or if you want to force this process), here is what you do.\nThe 3-2-1 Mastery Framework\nThe first step to acquiring any skill or progressing in life is to learn. Learning is the step that comes after curiosity. Learning is the first step to success in any given area. There is a reason your parents teach you during adolescence then you go on to spend 12-24 years in the education system. Thankfully, online education has and will continue to grow with specific knowledge related to anything you could ever want to do.\nSide note: learning can do more harm than good \u2014 but that is a topic for another newsletter. Education is a necessary evil. It only remains an evil to those that remain asleep. Stay aware and be open to letting go of learned information that does not serve your current situation.\nBack to what I was saying:\nKinda crazy how you can watch a few YouTube videos and outearn someone that has a 12 year degree\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) October 11, 2021\nFor some, the desire to self-educate and pursue the unconventional path comes naturally. They rebel as children and refuse to listen to authority. Their only option is to follow people online that speak confidently and align with their interests. Most people do this \u2014 but many do not have the intrinsic pressure to shift from consumer to creator.\nFor those that have a shred of interest in breaking free of the traditional path laid out in front of you (that you\u2019ve been expected by others to take out of projected fear) \u2014 this is for you. That is the first step. If you are not willing or ready to embark on the path of pursuing your life\u2019s work through your innate curiosity, stop reading.\nThe following 3-2-1 framework will bring structure to the dilemma of \u201cfiguring out what I want to do with my life.\u201d\n3 Resources \u2014 Interest Immersion\nThe purpose of exposing yourself to information related to your interests is to make connections. Connections and pattern recognition is what creates momentum. The indescribable feeling of excitement that dopamine signals provide.\nAt this point, you need to have an interest to pursue. Maybe something that you have seen others doing that you also want to do. Maybe something that will bring positive change to your life. Maybe something that just sounds like a fun hobby. Pick one. You can always start over.\nOnto the 3 resources. You will be choosing one book, one long-form resource, and one short-form resource to begin immersing yourself in that interest.\nThe book should be a best seller or highly rated within that given interest area. This will give you a broad overview of how said interest intersects with other areas of life. It will give you ideas to munch on and golden nuggets to note.\nThe long-form resource will be from podcasts, blogs, or YouTube channels. This will open up the rabbit hole of opportunity for you to dive into. This is where your curiosity must be embraced. If you feel compelled by the divine to spend 5 hours watching fitness YouTube videos \u2014 do it. That alone could be the start to a lifetime of passion-fueled income.\nThe short form resources will come from social media accounts that talk about your topic of interest. You can look up compilations of \u201cBest Accounts In X Niche To Follow,\u201d or keep an eye out for a list of Twitter accounts to pop onto your timeline.\nFun fact: one of those seemingly annoying lists of Twitter accounts is what introduced me to the improvement side of Twitter. Now I am one of the largest accounts there. Funny how that stuff works.\nPlease note that the short-form content serves its purpose, but can easily distract you from making progress. You do not need 300+ opinions (tweets) in the span of a day telling you what to do and what not to do. The short-form content is good to keep you on the path and bring potential opportunity but should be moderated. You could do entirely without the short-form content if you wanted to. Your brain will thank you.\n2 Outlets \u2014 Passion Testing\nPattern recognition and the ability to apply the information to a real-world problem is what creates passion. \u201cConnecting the dots\u201d between the real world and information in your head increases dopmaine levels. You will feel the excitement.\nAs you are going about learning via your 3 resources \u2014 you must start producing in an attempt to make sense of your learnings. Per the evergreen skills, writing and speaking are your outlet. Write on Twitter, in your journal, or on a new blog to spark more pattern recognition and help you make sense of your learnings. Write an ebook, write the code for an app, or build out a real world project. Speak to friends you can confide in, teach them what you are learning, and let the potential passion be displayed in your voice.\nYou can take this further by starting a project related to that interest. A social media brand, eCommerce store, or something that has monetization potential \u2014 which brings in the other evergreen skills, marketing and sales. Allowing you to connect even more dots. This is what makes people obsessed with building businesses.\n1 Month \u2014 Connection & Reflection\nYou must give your interest exploration time to marinate in your head. When most people quit after 2 weeks, commit to this interest for 1 month. Prove to yourself that you can learn at least some of the intricacies within that interest.\nAfter a month of book reading, content consuming, writing, and speaking \u2014 it\u2019s time to reflect. This will solidify whether you should drop it now or continue on.\nUnderstand: this has nothing to do with shiny object syndrome. Everything is interconnected. If you continue pursuing your interests, you will find the area that you want to master. Your other learnings along the way will only compliment this venture. My 7 \u201cfailed\u201d business attempts only helped me succeed when I found what I wanted to pursue. I wouldn\u2019t have known I wanted to pursue it if I didn\u2019t have the background knowledge (from other interests) to make it reality.\nWrite these questions down to reflect on your 1 month journey:\nIs this something I want to pursue further?\nAm I excited to dig into more books and content about this?\nDoes this skill or interest have utility? Are other people monetizing it?\nWhat problems could I solve with this? Can I see myself pursuing this as my life\u2019s work?\nDid this exploration make me aware of a new avenue that I want to explore?\nI cannot tell you what you should choose to do. That\u2019s on you. These questions will help.\nWith that, I encourage you to use this 3-2-1 process. At worst, you spent a month pursuing positive progress and opening up new avenues in the unknown to explore. At best, you found what you will dedicate your life to. Leading to mastery, money, and a higher quality of life.\nIf you enjoyed this newsletter, hit me with a reply or share it on Twitter.

        "content": "When I first started out in online business, I was lost. I suffered from all of the problems that I see others suffering from.\nIndecisive about their niche, skillset, offer, lead generation mechanism, and the rest. I was stuck in a loop of reaching out to local businesses, making OK money, but knowing that I was not building leverage in any form.\nOver the years, everything eventually clicked \u2014 as they will for you \u2014 but I wish I had done this sooner.\nThe C2C Business Model\nWe\u2019ve all heard of the B2B and B2C models. For those unaware, B2B is \u201cbusiness to business.\u201d Think an agency that sells marketing services to local businesses. B2C is \u201cbusiness to consumer.\u201d Like an eCommerce store selling coffee to an individual.\nAs social media has \u2014 and will continue to \u2014 grow and be the lifeblood of digital commerce, the want for human connection will grow alongside it. MOST businesses understand the importance of building their \u201conline presence.\u201d You can buy anything you would ever need online. Groceries, necessities, furniture, anything.\nThis is already developing at high speed, but I predict that things will continue to move into the hands of the individual, the creator. Amazon will always have a leg up, but smaller brands will continue to thrive in the personalization department (and they can always sell on Amazon if they\u2019d like.)\n\u201cThere are 7 billion people on Earth. Someday, I hope in the future there are 7 billion businesses.\u201d \u2014 Naval (?)\nIn comes the C2C business model. Creator to creator. Personal brand to personal brand. Individual to \u201cboutique\u201d shop. I was only exposed to this when I started building an audience. Now, everything I do revolved around working with individual creators that can solve my problems.\nThe common misconception here is that creators only sell courses, coaching, freelance services, or other kinds of digital products and services. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. There are people that sell homemade cutting boards, herbal supplements, bodybuilding supplements, beef liver jerky, and quite literally anything you could find on Amazon. They can sell their offers through their audience, email list, other digital assets, and any other free / paid traffic mechanism (Amazon, Google ads, Facebook ads, influencer and blog marketing, etc).\nIn short, the C2C business model is just like any other model \u2013 but with infinite scale, no need for a large team or employees, and allows you to be in full control of your time. Like renaissance times \u2014 trading your goods with the people of the city \u2014 but with the added power of the internet. The ability to reach anybody.\nWhy You Should Join The Creator Economy\nIt is growing like wildfire. People are starting to realize that personal brands have more influence than any other kind of lead generation mechanism. That\u2019s what a personal brand is. A lead generation mechanism for your products or services. The cool thing is, all you do is talk about your interests, what you are learning, and your expertise. People want to work with you because they connect with you on a human level.\nIn terms of what you can sell, it can be anything. If you are a beginner and want \u201cquick\u201d cash, start a freelance or coaching business. Creators of all forms need web design, email marketing, sales closers, performance coaching, masculinity coaching, SaaS development, quality physical products, and anything else that you could sell to a normal business. The upside? They are 10x more accessible than other businesses. Want to get in contact with them? Send them a DM. That simple.\n(P.S. you can learn all of these skills, how to build a personal brand, exactly how to make your first $3K, $5K, and first 6 figures inside Modern Mastery HQ. Proven strategies and systems. If you don\u2019t stick it out and make money \u2014 I will refund you every penny you paid me.)\nThe most profitable eCommerce brands are the ones that are personalized. They sell a product or service that fits a specific individual\u2019s interests and needs. They even market through personal brands and influencers with those interests. By understanding how to start and grow a personal brand, you bring that personal touch with you. You eliminate whatever saturation and competition existed in that space because nobody can replicate your personality.\nHow To Join The Creator Economy Through Self-Improvement\nIf people simply pursued their interests, solved their own life and business problems, systemized the solutions, and sold them to individuals that decided to solve different problems in their lives, you make money and have zero competition.\nBecoming a creator is a highly spiritual experience. Self-reflection and self-awareness teach you about human nature, persuasion, emotional triggers, and everything else that helps you capture and convert attention. You must learn to let your intuition lead in this space. Your authentic self must shine through by detaching from your faulty perceptions and identifications. Once that is done, life and business become a natural strength.\nThe service business and online education routes have the lowest risk and lowest barrier of entry.\nHere are the steps I would take to monetize any skill or interest as a creator, coach, freelancer, or digital product creator.\nStudy your interests\nStart a service business\nGrow an audience\nWork for free\nDevelop your process\nIncrease prices\nRepeat 5-6\nProductize your process\n\nThis takes 2 years for potential $50K+ months & 3 hour workdays\n\nCollege takes 4 years for potential $10K months & 9 hour workdays\n\u2014 DAN KOE (@thedankoe) January 11, 2022\n1) Study a skill or interest that somebody is already monetizing (and aligns with you).\nFact of the matter is, you can monetize anything nowadays. Even better, if somebody is already making money from it, you can make money too. Remember: a solid personal brand eliminates competition. There is already money flowing in a \u201csaturated\u201d space. Don\u2019t try to make money where money isn\u2019t flowing.\nIf you follow a lot of fitness people, understand it well, and have gotten yourself results \u2014 that is a good route to take. Same goes for anyone you follow on social media. Chances are you are learning from them, understand the topic well, and could help someone else get decent results.\n2) Start creating content and understanding your social platform of choice.\nI\u2019m biased towards Twitter (clearly). One, because it\u2019s a writing platform. You don\u2019t need to learn how to design or record graphics or videos. Two, the retweet button exposes you to an entire audience, you can grow much quicker than on other platform (like the strategies that JK Molina teaches to get your first 2000 quality followers in record time inside MMHQ)\nLearning how to grow and refine your thoughts through writing is rewarding in itself. When it comes time to monetize, it gets even better.\n3) Connect with other people and help them.\nAll online business owners will agree when I say that money is made in the DMs (especially when starting out). This is a key for growing your audience AND closing deals.\nWhen you are just starting, you have to talk with others and help them solve their problems for free. Give them tips on what you have expertise in, get on a call with them, understand their life or business, and help.\nI will be talking about this more on Tuesday\u2019s podcast episode, \u201cCollege or Business?\u201d where I go in-depth on all of these steps.\n4) Start charging.\nAfter you\u2019ve helped people and gained that next notch of experiential results under your belt \u2013 start charging $1000 minimum. You can watch this YouTube video I posted a bit back to learn the process.\n5) Increase prices and productize.\nNow that you\u2019ve substantially increased your prices, are landing 3-4 $5,000 clients per month, you can productize. That is, you can turn your system that get\u2019s results into a digital product that you can sell through the audience that you\u2019ve been building this entire time.\nDon\u2019t worry about this step until you\u2019ve gotten to this point. $10K/month via high ticket and 10,000 followers. If done correctly, it can take 6-12 months to get here. Maybe longer. Maybe shorter if you execute perfectly, but you are human.\nThat is all I have for this letter.\nI have way too many topics to write on, but I am excited to send them out to you each Friday.\nThank you for reading \u2013 and thank you for being a supporter of this newsletter. Have an incredible weekend, my friend.\nDan Koe"

        "heading": "Life Lessons Learned From A Decade Of Failures",
        "content": "Over the past six months, my life has been a blur of breakthroughs, big ideas, and exponential progress. I\u2019ve been experimenting with improvement in all areas of my life \u2014 mind, body, spirit, business \u2014 and after 10 years of life\u2019s ebbs and flows\u2026 things are starting to come together.\nWhen I first started lifting weights, I reached \u201cThe Peak Of Mount Stupid\u201d within a year.\nDunning Kreugar Effect\nI was obsessed with learning the fundamentals of training and nutrition. I studied people like Layne Norton, Alan Aragon, Eric Helms, and OG fitness influencers like Matt Ogus, Chris Lavado, Chris Jones, Vitruvian Physique, Michael Kory, and Rob Lipsett (who I had the pleasure of doing a podcast with a few months ago).\nI became an IIFYM zealot. The only thing that mattered to me was calories and macros. I stuffed my face with frozen burritos, pop tarts, and anything I could get my hands on to hit my carbs, fats, and proteins.\nThis worked to an extent. I gained quite a bit of muscle and strength. I was repping 275lbs on the bench press in my senior year in high school \u2014 but quickly realized that overdosing on Dr. Pepper every night while playing Halo 3 until 3 AM wasn\u2019t going to work. So I started experimenting.\nThe Optimal (Insert Aspect Of Life Here) Is A Myth\nOver the past 2 years, I have tried the vegan, keto, carnivore, low-carb, high-carb, and The Broke College Student diet.\nRecently, I became dogmatic about the pseudo-carnivore diet. In a nutshell, you eat mainly organ meats, muscle meats, gelatinous parts of the animal, in-season fruits, eggs, dairy, and a few other things. Heavy emphasis on sourcing the highest quality you can find.\nThe reason I was so dogmatic is that I was on a spree of elimination. I dropped alcohol, social events, and anything else that took my away from hitting my goal of 185 pounds. I had been trying to hit that weight for 3-4 years and finally got fed up with my lack of progress. (This podcast explains how my 25th birthday sparked this drastic change in mindset).\nNow that I have hit that goal, I am feeling myself moving from the \u201cSlope Of Enlightenment\u201d to the \u201cPlateau Of Sustainability.\u201d\nHere are my recent realizations:\nBalance Is Found Through Cycles Of Intensity\nHustle culture loves to glorify monk mode and intensity. I love a good old monk mode when you feel pulled to go all-in on a lesser purpose \u2014 laser-focused deep work, getting a years worth of work done in a month, losing sleep because the ideas won\u2019t stop flowing, and riding the wave of dopamine & intrinsic drive \u2014 but sustainability has to be taken into account.\nIf you stay in a state of intensity or optimization for too long, you hit a point of diminishing returns on quality of life.\nWhen I started optimizing too much, life lost its zest. Things became stressful. Everything outside of my normal routine was seen as a burden. If I didn\u2019t control every little thing about my life, I couldn\u2019t enjoy it for what it is.\nTrying to perfect every area of your life makes you hate the imperfections. When you do this, you prevent yourself from enjoying the imperfection that is baked into the human condition.\nNature is perfect. Nature Is. Humans were blessed with thought. But thought overcomplicates and misinterprets nature as imperfect. Society models nature \u2014 over-optimizing this is not a way to live.\nGoing home for the holidays to see my family only made me think about what I could eat, how much money I was spending, and when I would be able to go back home to \u201cget back on it.\u201d I could imagine myself judging their \u201cnormie\u201d actions. Not being able to enjoy time with my own family. When I head home later today, I will be making a conscious effort to enjoy my time with them.\nHowever, these states of intensity and optimization are necessary. I wouldn\u2019t have solidified these conclusions in my head without it. All self-improvement stems from awareness. Awareness is found by diving into the unknown. You cannot improve what you are not aware of \u2014 you cannot become aware of things you don\u2019t know exist (they exist in the unknown\u2026 the uncomfortable\u2026 the realm of infinite potential).\nWhen you transition out of these high-intensity states \u2014 you operate from a higher baseline on whatever you exponentially improved. Through intensity, you hit walls quickly. You gain 1 year of experience in 1 month. When you hit the metaphorical wall of over-optimization, life offers you a lesson. Are you going to learn from it?\nThe Fundamentals (And Your Consistency With Them) Are What Matters\nThrough my cycle of intensity, I have reached a higher baseline. I have better eating habits and my new fundamentals are locked down.\nThe fundamentals are what you can fall back on when things get too intense (or too lax). They are your system for getting results. They are the \u2018levers\u2019 for making progress.\nWhen you feel lost, overwhelmed, or directionless in your pursuit of personal and business development, come back to the fundamentals \u2014 write them down.\nMY health fundamentals are now:\nDaily raw liver, bone broth, and muscle meats for a pseudo-nose-to-tail carnivorous diet. Covering most bases in terms of vital nutrients.\nFruit, white rice, and tubers to fill carbs.\nFermented foods like goat milk kefir\nMy enlightenment elixir has and will remain a staple.\nFull body training 3x a week\nRunning and sprinting 4x a week\nLight activity (like hiking) on the weekend\nHitting 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight\nStress and emotional regulation\nNow that I am opening myself up to more social events, I am falling back to the 80/20 rule as I mentioned above. If I can stick to this for 80% of the time, it\u2019s safe to say I will continue making exponential progress in health. Alcohol is still eliminated, for now, it caused too much trouble. However, I am having a good time experimenting with micro-dosing psilocybin (zero calories and a world of benefits when it comes to writing).\nThe thing that gets me is the body of \u201cflexible dieters\u201d that have sustainability in mind. Take it even further and you have someone like Timbahwolf on Instagram who eats like shit and has a better physique than 99% of social influencers.\nThe Rock eats pancakes. Michael Phelps smokes weed and eats a ton of pizza. What we see on Twitter is what we expose ourselves to. I completely forgot where I came from back in the day and may have attributed my progress poorly.\nFrom my reflection: the biggest impact on my mental clarity, skin, and energy levels is from not overeating, being lean, having a purpose, stress regulation, training, and movement. NOT necessarily the ultra-high-quality high-fat diet that many are promoting. Most people stop overeating, start moving, stay consistent, and lockdown some other principles \u2014 THEN they go on to say it was some magic like eating raw liver or going keto. It seems like the cause and effect that people talk about in the health industry are misidentified \u2014 or polarized to promote a product.\nI am not saying this to sway your opinion. I\u2019m saying this so you approach life critically. With an open mind. Not limiting what could lead to enjoyment because you limit your awareness and knowledge of all areas of one given field. I value critical thinking and nuance \u2014 I will be heading in that direction more instead of being so dogmatic about a specific way of eating.\nAm I going to start gorging on junk food? No. I will test and experiment as you should. From this new baseline and level of awareness, I will be able to accurately see the short-term effects on my body.\nWhen traveling, you bet your ass I\u2019m not missing out on commonly demonized foods like pasta, bread, and other carb sources. I\u2019ll probably post some pictures on Insta of all the BBQ I\u2019ll be eating in Texas next week. These are demonized by some researchers and glorified by others.\nIf you want to break out of whatever health ideology or religion you have subscribed to, I\u2019ve started listening to this older Joe Rogan podcast with Layne Norton and Dom D\u2019Agostino (they debate about flexible dieting and keto).\nThis is the beauty of these \u201cCycles Of Intensity.\u201d My health philosophy is an amalgamation of the experience I\u2019ve gained throughout my 10 years of improving it. It is backed by research and experience from all sides. This is powerful and is the same for other pillars of my life.\nThis does not eliminate the merit of a disciplined lifestyle. This IS a disciplined lifestyle. This \u201cbalanced\u201d lifestyle is harder to pull off than eliminating things entirely \u2014 but with a higher potential reward. This is why intensity is needed to find balance. I spun my wheels for multiple years because I was afraid to go all in. I was afraid to learn the lessons that life had waiting for me in the unknown.\nThis is very different \u2014 yet very similar \u2014 compared to my previous diet. I got to this point through conscious experimentation.\nLife Is A Series Of Science Experiments\nI have been speaking in terms of health here\u2026 but this applies to all areas of life.\nEvery single topic can be argued and researched to the end of the Earth. If I want to be dogmatic about holistic health, I can find research and compelling arguments backing that. There is no fun in that though. The fun comes from being open-minded, holding things in the realm of possibility, questioning everything, and solidifying a nuanced perspective through direct experience.\nLife is about experimentation. Learning what you like and don\u2019t like. Seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t. Slowly making small upgrades in the traits, skills, and wisdom that your character holds. These small boosts in experience and upgrades lead to massive results in the game of life (sometimes you don\u2019t even notice them until you reflect on your progress).\nFor me, I switched majors in college 6 times before I came across coding. That led to a dopamine-fueled extravaganza of learning to code. That led to experimenting with freelancing and other online business models. That led to starting Modern Mastery. The progress has been immense.\nIf you have no idea what to pursue \u2014 your life\u2019s work, your purpose, your passions \u2014 you must start experimenting. You need to throw shit at a wall and see what sticks. You need to try enough things until you experience that intrinsic drive that pulls you into a high-intensity state. This happens thanks to dopamine. Dopamine separates signal from noise. Dopamine tells you that you are doing something right (beware: cheap dopamine).\nHow do you start experimenting? You treat all areas of your life as a science project.\nThe Scientific Method\nYour body is a project. Your health is a project. Your relationships are a project. Your business is a project. All of these have more projects embedded in them. The \u201cProject Mindset\u201d is powerful. My roommate has started thinking of his body as a project. This simple act made him track his improvements, lose 80 pounds, and be mindful of how he \u201cworks\u201d on this project.\nProjects imply a desired outcome (improvement), steps to completion (goals and metrics), and actions that will move you closer to completion (priorities).\nExperiments imply risks that you need to take into account, intention, testing, and iteration. This means that you have to see an experiment through. You can\u2019t quit before things start to get good.\nThey also imply failure. Not all experiments are successful. When you think of this as a project, it is easier to detach from the outcome. You see failure as a chance to iterate and improve. Failure is feedback on what to improve. Looping back to awareness \u2014 you cannot improve what you are not aware of.\nYou need to come into your experiments with an open and curious mind. This will give room for questioning. Curiosity is fueled by questions. Question: What would life look like if I tried this thing I\u2019ve never tried before?\nYou will naturally feel the pull to dive into the unknown. If you don\u2019t, keep asking questions until you feel energized. That is your call to adventure. A call to become an explorer of the unknown. A call to start actualizing your potential.\nThe Meaning Of Life Is To Pass Down Your Experiences\nExperiments = experience.\nExperimentation is how you find what works for you. Experimentation is how you form your personal health, wealth, and relationships philosophy \u2014 allowing you to pass down your lessons and make money doing so (this is arguably the meaning of life per ancient and modern teachers, self-transcendence).\nExperimentation is how you form your life philosophy. An operating manual that keeps you on the enjoyable, sustainable, and fulfilling path.\nSince we talk a lot about business here \u2014 this ties in perfectly. Business \u2014 in our case online business \u2014 is your vessel for pursuing your life\u2019s work. Your life\u2019s work consists of pursuing your interests (experiments), becoming a niche of one (understanding how to market, sell, and distribute), and packaging up your experiences in a way that the end-user can digest and implement. Money is a byproduct of your irreplaceable value.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post \u2014 you can get early access to all of them by subscribing to The Mastery Letter."

We are here to talk about focused work, but you can see the problem that the attention economy has created.\nFocus is a currency and we must invest it wisely.\nMinimum Risk, Potential Reward\nThe attention economy is only disastrous if you are on the consumer end.\nOpportunities are springing up like weeds and in order to take advantage of them, you need to produce.\nYou need to focus your attention on building something with minimal risk, but with the potential to pay off big.\nThese are called asymmetric bets.\nAsymmetric Bets\nSome opportunities that have popped up in the last 5-10 years (that you can still take advantage of):\nCryptocurrency\nBuilding a social media audience\nOffering a niche freelance service\nStarting a marketing agency\nProductizing your expertise and selling it online\nStarting a podcast or blog\n4 years ago I started freelancing with web design.

        "heading": "Why Self-Help Is Ruining Your Life",
        "content": "Self-help is making you miserable. Let\u2019s change that.\nThis is a topic that has been on my mind recently. I want to clear the room up front by saying that self-help is not inherently bad. It can be good in many cases.\nThe energy and information you gain from reading self-help needs to be channeled correctly.\nThe Problem With Self-Help\nHave you ever bought a book and expect your life to change? Don\u2019t lie.\nThe titles, sub-titles, and social praise from a book hook our attention. We build false expectations in our heads, order the book with excitement, and start to consume it.\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2026 You and I both know that reading alone isn\u2019t going to change your life.\nWe end up getting trapped in a cycle of reading with good intentions, but end up reading just to feel good about ourselves.\nThis is called mental masturbation.\nReading about improving yourself but not actually improving yourself.\nReading to feel good about yourself, to feel like you are actually improving that is.\nIn reality, your brain loves collecting those dopamine hits and enforcing the mental masturbation loop further.\nThe Difference Between Self-Help and Self-Improvement\nSelf-help is extrinsic motivation \u2013 relying on external factors to motivate you.\nFor the David Goggin\u2019s of the world (\u201cfuck motivation, all you need is discipline\u201d), you can start to see the problem here.\n\u201cAll you need is discipline,\u201d is partially true.\nThe extrinsic motivation we get from self-help books is useful for 3 reasons:\nWe are motivated (which can be used as initial momentum into discipline)\nWe are equipped with a concept that can change our lives\nWe understand how to implement that concept\nThe magic happens in the last point. It forms the basis for self-improvement.\nThat\u2019s the difference between the two.\nSelf-help = unsustainable motivation\nSelf-improvement = implementing self-help concepts, seeing results, and cultivating intrinsic motivation\nThe Thing That Can F*ck You Up\nNot all self-improvement is created equal.\nMany people fail to understand is that some concepts may not work for you. We are human. We are each different in our own unique ways.\nThis is what creates an anti-self-improvement mindset.\nThe ones who adopt this mindset implemented a self-help concept, it didn\u2019t work for them, and they go on to tell everyone that it doesn\u2019t work.\nAt the same time there are people that swear by the exact same concepts.\nLet\u2019s take the gym for example.\nSome people love bench press, some people hate it.\nSome people say it is a bad exercise for chest growth, others say it\u2019s the best.\nMechanics, genetics, noobie gains, and muscle insertions aside\u2026\nHow can you know that bench press is a good exercise for you without doing it consistently?\nIf you implemented this exercise, continuously increased weight, and stuck to it for 6-12 months \u2013 THEN you can decide if it\u2019s good or bad.\nThis goes for any other concept that can improve your life.\nTrying it for a day, deciding it sucks, and dropping it will f*ck you up.\nA Foundation of Awareness & House of Direct Experience\nAll true self improvement stems from awareness and is solidified through direct experience.\nSelf-help information makes you aware of a problem you may have. It gives you steps to fix it.\nFollowing those steps (direct experience) for a given amount of time is what improves your life.\nIf you have given ample time and still not seen results, awareness comes back into play and the cycle continuous. Continuous improvement.\nIf you have a clouded/anxious mind and a self-help book tells you to meditate, you need to meditate on a consistent basis to see if it actually helps you. If it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.\nSelf-help concepts act as a \u201cboost\u201d to your awareness.\nDirect experience helps you understand if it is useful to you.\nIf it is useful to you, the intrinsic motivation starts to build.\nIf it isn\u2019t useful to you, go back to the awareness step. This is what most people skip.\nThe worst thing you could do at this point is write off self-help as a whole.\nThat\u2019s how you end up living an average life.\nShow me anyone you aspire to be like that doesn\u2019t have a foundation of continuous improvement in their life. You won\u2019t be able to. If you can, these people aren\u2019t worth aspiring to be like.\nYour business will suffer if you don\u2019t improve yourself as your business grows.\nYour relationships will suffer if you don\u2019t improve yourself as they grow.\nYour health will suffer if you aren\u2019t aware of the hidden problems it is causing.\nTLDR\nSelf-help is bad if you are reading it to feel like you are actually doing something.\nSelf-improvement is good if you develop awareness and intrinsic drivers with time."
